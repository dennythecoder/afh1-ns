<p><b><i><span>Section 1A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>1.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>As
preparation for your entry into the Air Force, this section will introduce the
Air Force mission and their evolution, the machines and technology associated
with air and space flight and most importantly, the legacy of the men and women
of the United States Air Force. By surveying the history of aviation, you will
discover our heritage, appreciate Air Force traditions, and understand your
role in our nation's defense. This United States Air Force Historical
Perspective is by Dr. John T. Farquhar from the United States Air Force Academy
Department of History and contributing editor George W. Bradley III, the Air
Force Space Command Historian. The enlisted portions of this document were provided
by the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Research Institute's historian, Mr. William
I. Chivalette. Dr. John Q. Smith, Senior Air Force Historian, assisted with
additional editing.</span></p>



<p><b><i><span>Section 1B Dawn of Flight, Early Days of
Aviation, First Air War and the 1920s and 1930s Airpower</span></i></b><span>&nbsp;<b>1.2. The Dawn of Flight:</b></span></p>

<p><span>1.2.1. The dream of
flight recurs in myth and legend from ancient times, but not until two French
brothers, Joseph Michel and Jacques Etienne Montgolfier, launched a hot air
balloon on 15 October 1783, with passenger Jean Fran ois Pilatre de Rozier, did
man first  fly.  The military potential of aviation was noted in 1794, when the
French  Aerostatic Corps' balloons accompanied the armies of the French
Revolution until 1798.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="211" height="158" src="afh1_files/image001.png" ></span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Inflating the Civil War balloon Intrepid, 1862</span></i></b></p>



<p><span>1.2.2. In September
1861, a  Balloon Corps' provided aerial observation for the Union Army during
the American Civil War. However, the early balloons proved fragile, vulnerable
to weather, and of limited value.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.2.3. Aviation languished
in the United States, but in Europe, balloons, gliders, and aerodynamics
advanced rapidly. By 1853, Britain's Sir George Cayley created a glider with
fixed wings, cambered airfoil, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers.
Continuing Cayley's work, German engineer Otto Lilienthal produced flying
machines similar to today's hang gliders. From 1891 until his death five years
later, Lilienthal greatly advanced aerodynamic theory. The publicity generated
by Lilienthal spurred on imaginative people on both sides of the Atlantic,
including Orville and Wilbur Wright.</span></p>

<p><span>1.2.4. The Wrights
furthered Lilienthal's experiments with the assistance of American Octave
Chanute, whose book,&nbsp;<i>Progress in Flying Machines</i>, provided their
foundation in aeronautics. From 1900 to 1902, the Wrights conducted more than
1,000 glides from Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. After
perfecting wing warping, elevators and rudders, and a water-cooled engine, they
attempted the first powered flight on 14 December 1903. On that try, the
aircraft stalled upon takeoff and crashed three seconds later. Success came at
10:35, on 17 December 1903, when Orville Wright flew 120 feet in 12 seconds.
Alternating pilot duties, the brothers made three more flights with Wilbur
flying 852 feet and staying aloft 59 seconds on the fourth attempt.</span></p>

<p><span>1.2.5. American military
authorities rejected the Wrights' flyer, reacting in part to the highly
publicized failure of Samuel P. Langley's steam-powered Aerodrome in October
1903. Although a highly respected scientist and Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, Langley and the Army were subjected to public ridicule and
Congressional criticism for the  waste  of a $50,000 government grant. Only
when President Theodore Roosevelt intervened was an aeronautical division
established in the United States Army's Signal Corps on 1 August 1907.</span></p>

<p><span>1.2.6. With the
establishment of an aeronautical division the army was in possession of several
balloons. The Army required trained enlisted men to conduct balloon inflations
and effect necessary repairs. Effective 2 July 1907, Eddy Ward and Jason
Barrett reported to the Leo Stevens' balloon factory in New York City. They
would become the first enlisted men assigned to the Signal Corps' small
Aeronautical Division, which in time evolved into the United States Air Force
enlisted corps.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="148" height="200" src="afh1_files/image002.png" ></span></p>

Rosenberger, Corporal Edward Ward, Pvt. Cecil R. Colle, Pvt. William E.
McConnell. Seated are Pvt. John Crotty (left) and Pvt. Benjamin Schmidt.</span></b></p>



<p><span>1.2.7. When Ward and
Barrett reported, the division did not officially exist. The Army had disbanded
the minuscule Civil War balloon service in 1863, and the corps' attempts to
revive military aviation met with little success. At the balloon factory, the
two men were schooled in the rudiments of fabric handling, folding, and
stitching; in the manufacturing of buoyant gases; and in the inflation and
control of the Army's  aircraft. </span></p>

<p><span>1.2.8. On 13 August
1907, Ward and Barrett were ordered to report to Camp John Smith outside
Norfolk, Virginia, to participate in the Jamestown Exposition celebrating the
300th anniversary of the first settlement of Virginia. Over the next few years,
the detachment participated in numerous air shows and moved from location to
location. Barrett left the Army to complete a career in the Navy, but the
enlisted detachment was soon expanded to include eight others. These nine men
were the nucleus from which America's enlisted air arm grew. They were the
first of a small band of enlisted Airmen who, during the decade before World
War I, shared in the experimental and halting first steps to establish military
aviation as a permanent part of the Nation's defense. Never numbering more than
a few hundred individuals, the enlisted crews of the Signal Corps' Aeronautical
Division provided day-to-day support for a handful of officer pilots, learned
the entirely new skills of airplane  mechanician  and later, mechanic, rigger,
and fitter met daunting transportation and logistical challenges, and
contributed mightily to the era's seat-of-the-pants technological advances.</span></p>

<p><span>1.2.9. A few enlisted
men, against official and semi-official military prejudice, learned to fly. The
majority of enlisted men were absorbed in the tasks of getting the fragile
balloons and even flimsier planes of the day into the air and keeping them
there. Of necessity flexible and innovative, early crews often had to rebuild
aircraft from the ground up after every crash and, in those early days of
flight; crashes were the rule rather than the exception. Enlisted crews not
only repaired the planes, they labored to make some of the more ill-designed craft
airworthy in the first place.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.3. The Early Days of the United States Army
Aviation (1907-1917):</span></b></p>



<p align="center"><span><img width="255" height="148" src="afh1_files/image003.png" ></span></p>



<p><b><span>&nbsp; Wright brothers at
Kitty Hawk</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.3.1. By December 1907,
the new Aeronautical Division of the Signal Corps established specifications
for an American military aircraft. The flying machine had to carry two people
(with a combined weight of 350 pounds or less), and fly for 125 miles at an average
speed of 40 miles per hour (mph). The Army received 41 bids, but only one,
submitted by the Wright brothers, produced a flyable aircraft. By September
1908, the Wright Type  A  Military Flyer flew for more than an hour at a
maximum altitude of 310 feet, carrying the first military observer, Lieutenant
Frank P. Lahm. A subsequent test on 17 September 1908 resulted in the first
military aviation fatality: Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge. On 30 July 1909,
pilot Orville Wright and Lieutenant Benjamin D. Foulois flew from Fort Myer to
Alexandria, Virginia, at an average speed of 42.6 mph. The Army accepted the
plane 2 August 1909 and awarded the Wrights $25,000 and a $5,000 bonus.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.3.2. The United States
Army's early air operations were not promising. In October 1909, Wilbur Wright
trained Lieutenants Frank P. Lahm and Frederic E. Humphreys to fly; on 26
October, they were the first Army pilots to fly solo.</span></p>

<p><span>By 5 November, they
crashed the Army's plane and within weeks were transferred out of aviation. In
March 1910, Lieutenant Foulois received orders to become the Signal Corps 
pilot. Chief of the Signal Corps, Gen James Allen, told him,  Don t worry.
You ll learn the techniques as you go along...just take plenty of spare parts
and teach yourself to fly. </span></p>

<p><span>1.3.3. United States
military aviation was falling behind Europe. By the end of 1911, the French had
produced 353 aviators versus 26 American pilots, of whom only eight were
military. By 1913, France and Germany each had spent $22 million on military
aviation; Russia spent $12 million; and even Belgium spent $2 million, compared
to just $430,000 for the United States.</span></p>

<p><span>1.3.4. Increased
appropriations over the ensuing two years allowed the Army to purchase more
aircraft. By October 1912, the Aeronautical Division had 11 aircraft, 14 flying
officers, and 39 enlisted mechanics. On 28 September 1912, one of these
mechanics, Corporal Frank Scott, became the first enlisted person to die in an
accident in a military aircraft. A crew chief, Scott was flying as a passenger
when the aircraft's pilot lost control and the aircraft dived to earth. Scott
Field, now Scott Air Force Base, in Illinois, was named in his honor. On 5
March 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron (Provisional) was activated becoming the
oldest Air Force squadron.</span></p>

<p><span>1.3.5. After years of
testing, improvising, and operating on little more than dedication and a
shoestring, Army aviation finally received official status by the passage of
United States House Resolution 5304 on 18 July 1914. This bill authorized the
Signal Corps to establish an aviation section consisting of 60 officers and 260
enlisted men. The bill created the military rating of aviation mechanician,
which called for a 50 percent pay increase for enlisted men  instructed in the
art of flying  while they were on flying status. The number of such personnel
was limited to 40, and the law specified that no more than a dozen enlisted men
could be trained as aviators.</span></p>

<p><span>1.3.6. America's first
aviation combat experience demonstrated that the air arm was not prepared.
After Francisco  Pancho  Villa's Mexican forces raided Columbus, New Mexico, in
March 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the 1st Aero Squadron to accompany
a force he was organizing to protect the border and to apprehend Pancho Villa.
The squadron, commanded by Captain Foulois, sought to provide aerial scouting
for the ground forces. Mustering 11 pilot officers, 82 enlisted men, and one
civilian mechanic, the squadron departed from San Antonio with eight Curtiss
JN-3  Jennies,  ten trucks, and six motorcycles. On the train, Foulois picked
up two enlisted hospital corpsmen. An officer and 14 enlisted men of the
engineering section joined them. In spite of the 1st Aero Squadron s
reconnaissance flights and several deliveries of mail and dispatches, readily
apparent was the squadron's JN type aeroplane was not powerful enough to
operate at the 5,000-foot elevations of the Casa Grande, and mountain weather,
dust, and extreme temperatures wreaked havoc with Foulois' underpowered,
dilapidated Curtis JN-3 Jennies. By 19 April, only two of the eight planes were
in working condition. The rest had fallen victim to landing accidents and
forced landings, and all had suffered from the heat and sand.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.3.7. After 11 months
of fruitless campaigning, the so-called Punitive Expedition was recalled in
February 1917, and Villa continued to lead rebels in northern Mexico until
1920. Yet, poorly equipped as it was the 1st Aero Squadron had acquitted itself
admirably. In his final report on the mission, Major Foulois praised his
pilots, who because of poor climbing characteristics of the aircraft, could not
carry sufficient food or even adequate clothing. Foulois also commended the
willingness of his pilots to fly clearly dangerous aircraft. He did not neglect
the enlisted personnel; he praised them for their dedication and willingness to
work day and night to keep the aircraft flying. If the performance was
admirable, the fact remains that the results of this first demonstration of
American air power were deeply disappointing. Yet Foulois and the others
learned valuable lessons about the realities of aviation under field
conditions. Adequate maintenance was essential, as were plenty of backup
aircraft, which could be rotated into service while other airplanes were removed
from the line and repaired. Enlisted and civilian mechanics faced a myriad of
problems; in particular, the laminated wood propellers pulled apart. In
response, the mechanics developed a humidor facility to maximize the life of
the props.</span></p>

<p><span>1.3.8. Army brass
persisted in discouraging the training of enlisted men, and if not for officers
such as Billy Mitchell and Hap Arnold, who developed a deep and abiding respect
for enlisted personnel in military aviation, there probably would have been
even fewer enlisted aviators than the law allowed. The Signal Corps authority
to train more enlisted men was largely through the efforts of Mitchell and the
National Defense Act of 3 June 1916. When the United States entered World War
I, however, there were no more than a dozen non-officers qualified as pilots.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.4. The First Air War:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.4.1. Aircraft and
aerial warfare evolved during the first World War, 1914-1918. Observation,
artillery spotting, and reconnaissance emerged as the airplane's most important
war missions. By 1915, pursuit aircraft were developed to deny the enemy use of
the air. After early attempts to down enemies with handguns, French pilot
Roland Garros attached steel plates to the propeller of his Morane-Saulnier
Type L monoplane, enabling him to fire a machine gun through the propeller arc.
He earned wide acclaim as the war's first  ace.  When engine trouble forced
Garros to land behind enemy lines on 19 April 1915, the Germans studied his
innovation. Dutch-born Anthony Fokker then created the first true fighter
plane, the Fokker Eindecker, using an interrupter gear to enable a machine gun
to fire through the propeller. By the end of World War I, Airmen had pioneered
most of today's aerial missions, including photographic reconnaissance, close
air support for ground troops, battlefield interdiction, and day and nighttime
strategic bombardment. The German air service inaugurated long-range strategic
bombardment as early as 1915 with their massive Zeppelin dirigibles.</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.2. Despite the
importance of reconnaissance and artillery spotting, fighter pilots captured
the public's imagination. Newspapers portrayed the daring, skill, and chivalry
of the  knights of the air.  Following Roland Garros, the French produced such
aces as Rene Fonck, with 75 kills, and Georges Guynemer, with 54 aerial
victories.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.3. Like the allies,
Germany publicized  aces' to foster public support for the war effort.
Germany's first ace, Max Immelmann, developed a revolutionary technique to
reverse direction of an aircraft in flight. The technique still bears his name.
Manfred von Richtofen, perhaps the most famous ace of all, flew a scarlet
Fokker triplane, earning him the name,  the Red Baron.  Shortly after his 80th
victory, Richtofen was shot down and killed on 21 April 1918.</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.4. Not to be outdone
by the French and Germans, Britain exulted in the exploits of fighter pilots.
Britain's leading ace, with 73 kills, was Edward  Mick  Mannock, who was killed
by ground fire while aiding a novice wingman.</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.5. As early as 1915,
Americans flew in the European war, both with the French and the British though
it was the American-manned Lafayette Escadrille of France that earned the
greatest and most enduring fame. The French air service established the&nbsp;<i>Escadrille
Americaine</i>&nbsp;for American volunteers on 21 March 1916. Later renamed
the&nbsp;<i>Lafayette Escadrille</i>, this squadron flew French Nieuport 17
fighters and provided valuable experience when the United States entered the
war. French-born American Raoul Lufbery shot down 17 German planes before
transferring to the American Air Service, where he commanded the famous  Hat in
the Ring  94th Aero Squadron, before his death on 19 May 1918.</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.6.
A little-acknowledged fact about the Lafayette Escadrille is the roster of
aviators included an enlisted man who was also an African-American one of the
very few enlisted Americans to fly in the war Corporal Eugene Bullard was the
son of a Georgia former slave. As a member of the French Foreign Legion, he was
awarded the Croix de Guerre (one of 15 decorations from the French government)
and was wounded four times before the legion gave him a disability discharge.
During his convalescence in Paris, he bet an American $2,000 that he could
learn to fly and become a combat aviator. Corporal Bullard won the bet by
completing training and joining the Lafayette Escadrille. Styling himself the
 Black Swallow of Death,  he claimed two victories. Despite his record of
daring and dedication, he was grounded at the request of American officers
attached to the escadrille. When the escadrille pilots were reorganized and
incorporated into the American Expeditionary Force, Bullard was denied the
officer's commission accorded to other American escadrille aviators and to most
of the handful of white enlisted men who had earned their wings in regular
United States Army outfits.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>2</span></b><b><sup><span>nd</span></sup></b><b><span>&nbsp;Lt. Frank Luke, Jr.</span></b></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;1.4.7. Of the 767 United States pilots and
481 observers in action in 1918, Capt Edward V.  Eddie  Rickenbacker and
Lieutenant Frank Luke, Jr., achieved the most fame. Rickenbacker was a renowned
race car driver before the war. Older than most pilots, the 28-year-old became
America's  Ace of Aces' with 26 confirmed kills. Frank Luke was the only pilot
awarded the Medal of Honor during the war (Rickenbacker would be awarded one in
1931). Known as the  Arizona Balloon Buster,  Luke downed 14 German balloons
and four aircraft in 17 days. His spectacular career ended on 29 September 1918
during a solo attack, when he shot down three enemy balloons and two aircraft
before enemy ground fire forced him down. Seriously wounded, he died with a
pistol in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.4.8. Enlisted men flew
before, during, and after World War I but their status remained vague. On 22
January 1919, the commanding officer of the Air Mechanics School at Kelly Field
sought to clarify the situation by asking the Office of Military Aeronautics
for a definition of  enlisted aviator  and  aerial flier.  The Kelly commanding
officer wanted to know who exactly was entitled to wear the enlisted aviator
insignia on the upper-right shoulder of his tunic. The reply came on 31
January,   you are advised that although uniform regulations and specifications
provide for an insignia to be worn by enlisted aviators, the grade itself has
never been created and consequently there is no one in the service entitled to
wear the insignia provided for such grade.  In other words, enlisted aviators,
who had served as instructors, ferry pilots, test pilots, and mechanical
flight-check pilots, did not exist at least not officially.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="175" height="147" src="afh1_files/image006.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Sergeant William C.
Ocker</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="150" height="219" src="afh1_files/image007.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>George H. Holmes</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.4.9. Vernon Burge and
the handful of World War I enlisted aviators who immediately followed him were
the first of some 3,000 enlisted personnel who would fly between the wars and into
the early months of World War II. The military withheld official flying status
from these men until Congress enacted Public Law 99 in 1941, which provided for
training enlisted  aviation students,  who were  awarded the rating of pilot
and warranted as a staff sergeant.  Late in 1942, however, Congress passed the
Flight Officer Act (Public Law 658), which automatically promoted sergeant
pilots produced by the Staff Sergeant Pilot Program to flight officers. Thus,
the cockpit was effectively reserved  for the commissioned.  One enlisted
pilot, Sergeant William C. Ocker, inspired to fly by watching Vernon Burge,
received his commission in January 1917 and commanded a flight school in
Pennsylvania. However, before this his flying skills made Ocker a valuable
commodity in the Aviation Section. Known as the  Father of Blind Flight,  Ocker
flight-tested modified aircraft, served as a flight instructor, and was
hand-picked to scout various parcels for future airfields near the Potomac
River. One of the tracts he selected became Bolling Field, Washington District
of Columbia.</span></p>



<p><span>1.4.10. Master Sergeant
George H. Holmes was the last of about 2,500 men who graduated from enlisted
pilot training. He became a pilot in 1921 and was eventually promoted to
lieutenant colonel during World War II. When the war ended, he chose to revert
to his enlisted rank of master sergeant. He was the last enlisted pilot to
serve and retired in 1957.</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.11. In addition to
the specialized roles directly associated with flying, Air Service enlisted
personnel<b>&nbsp;</b>performed a wide variety of general support functions in
administration, mess, transport, and the medical corps. Construction personnel,
who built the airfields, hangars, barracks, and other buildings, were often the
first enlisted men stationed at various overseas locations.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.12. World War I
Airmen were not combat soldiers as such, but enlisted men who stood guard and
operated base defense. Given the static nature of the war, there was relatively
little danger of a base being overrun by ground troops. Air attacks, however,
happened frequently. Aerial bombardment and strafing techniques improved later
in the war, and enlisted men received training in the operation of antiaircraft
machine guns.</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.13. Enlisted
personnel also served as observers for both the aircraft and balloon corps. In
this capacity Sergeant Fred C. Graveline of the 20th Aero Squadron was able to
receive the Distinguished Flying Cross. Graveline served as an observer and
aerial gunner from 30 September to 5 November 1918 on 15 missions in the back
seat of a DH-4. In one 35minute battle in which Graveline remarked he  aged 10
years,  he helped drive off nearly two dozen German planes, shooting down two.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="227" height="171" src="afh1_files/image009.png" ></span></p>



<p><span>1.4.14. While he was not
an ace, William  Billy  Mitchell emerged as one of the outstanding American air
combat commanders of the war, in essence the first Combined Forces Air
Component Commander, as he directed British, French, and American airpower.
Supremely confident about the efficacy of airpower, Mitchell sometimes clashed
with his superiors, including aviation pioneer General Foulois. Nevertheless,
Foulois recognized Mitchell's leadership and recommended him for the top combat
position, Chief of Air Service, 1st Army. In September 1918, Mitchell massed 1,481
aircraft of American, French, British, and Italian units to support General
Pershing's St. Mihiel offensive. Mitchell emphasized concentrated, mass attacks
to overwhelm enemy airpower and punish German ground forces. In four days,
Allied Airmen flew 3,300 combat sorties and dropped 75 tons of explosives.
Lauded as a success by General Pershing, Mitchell refined his tactics during
the Meuse-Argonne offensive of 26 September 1918, where 700 American aircraft
faced 500 German planes. By 1918, based upon his outstanding performance
directing Air Service combat units over the Ch teau-Thierry area, the St.
Mihiel salient, and the Meuse-Argonne, Mitchell earned the Distinguished
Service Cross for valor and temporary promotion to brigadier general.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.4.15. By the Armistice
of 11 November 1918, airpower had played an important role in the Allied
victory. Although observation, reconnaissance, and artillery spotting remained
the most significant missions, close air support, interdiction, and strategic
bombardment showed promise. Eclipsing all other roles, the image of the
glamorous fighter ace with his brightly painted aircraft, leather jacket, and
flying scarf captured public attention. The Army Air Service destroyed 781
enemy aircraft and 73 balloons at a cost of 289 American aircraft, 48 balloons,
and 569 battle casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.16. At the end of
the war, more than 190,000 men were serving in the Air Service, 74,000 of them
overseas with the American expeditionary force. On the same day, the Air
Service halted all inductions of enlisted recruits and began the process of
dissolving its forces. Combat groups and wings in Europe were disbanded
immediately, but squadrons remained intact to serve initially as the basic
demobilization unit structures. Since the Air Service had no clear idea of the
authorized final strength for the postwar peacetime, it cut loose men in
wholesale batches. The Army, in general, and the air service, in particular,
took considerable pains to help discharged enlisted men find jobs after leaving
the service. The Army worked closely with Federal officials to aid veterans and
even allowed some men to remain in the service temporarily beyond their
discharge if they had no prospects for work. Air service commanding officers
provided special letters of recommendation to former mechanics and technically
trained enlisted men in an effort to help them find employment.</span></p>

<p><span>1.4.17. On 20 May 1918,
President Woodrow Wilson issued an Executive Order that transferred Army
aviation from under the Signal Corps control to the Secretary of War. Later
that same month, the Army officially recognized the Bureau of Aircraft
Production and the Division of Military Aeronautics as the Air Service. World
War I showed the difficulty of coordinating air activities under the existing
organization, thus the Army Reorganization Act of 1920 made the Air Service an
official combat arm of the Army.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.5. Controversy and Records, 1920s Airpower:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.5.1. Budget cutbacks
reduced the 1918 Air Service from 190,000 men to fewer than 20,000. Likewise,
the $460 million allocated for military aviation in 1919 fell to $25 million in
1920. Even worse from a technology viewpoint, Congress demanded that new
military aircraft use the surplus Liberty engines produced during the World War
I buildup. Consequently, First World War vintage Curtiss Jennies and Liberty
DH-4 bombers remained in service until the 1930s, despite technological
advances in airframe and engine design.</span></p>

<p><span>1.5.2. As far back as
1919, while Congress debated the size of the postwar establishment, the Air
Service mounted shows for all occasions. Scarcely a county fair or patriotic
gathering within flying distance of a military airfield operated without an
aerial demonstration. Enlisted mechanics might lecture on how to repair the
Liberty engine, while pilots flew acrobatics overhead. The traveling air shows,
known as circuses, coincided with Victory Loan rallies and in later years
provided entertainment at Armistice Day or Washington's Birthday celebrations.
Enlisted pilots also took part in air shows, including a trio of intrepid
flying sergeants who in 1923 put together an act that involved flying a tight
 V  formation while their planes were tied together with cords. Other enlisted
pilots offered more routine skills, such as dropping demonstration smoke bombs.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="163" height="211" src="afh1_files/image010.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.5.3. A concerted
effort to achieve records in speed, altitude, endurance, and other areas helped
spur aviation advances in the 1920s. In September 1922, Lieutenant James
 Jimmy  Doolittle became the first man to fly across the United States in less
than a day. Seven months later, Lieutenants Oakley Kelley and John Macready
flew a Fokker T-2 on the first nonstop transcontinental flight. On 6 April
1924, a team of Army pilots departed Seattle in four Douglas World Cruisers,
christened the&nbsp;<i>Chicago</i>,&nbsp;<i>Boston</i>,&nbsp;<i>Seattle</i>,
and&nbsp;<i>New Orleans</i>, in an effort to fly around the world. Although
the&nbsp;<i>Seattle</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Boston</i>&nbsp;were lost to a
mountain crash and engine failure, respectively, the remaining aircraft
completed the circuit 175 days later. In 1925, Jimmy Doolittle achieved further
fame by winning the Schneider Trophy, an over water seaplane race, and
established a world seaplane record at 245.71 miles per hour. Although less
publicized, Doolittle also played a major role in designing and testing instruments
for all weather flying, including an altimeter, gyro, artificial horizon, and
radio navigation aids. On 24 September 1929, Doolittle was the first pilot to
take off, fly a set course, and land using instruments alone.</span></p>

<p><span>1.5.4. Air activities
through the mid-1920s were relatively limited and generally focused on
establishing records, testing equipment, and garnering headlines. Master
electrician Jack Harding and Sergeant First Class Jerry Dobias served aboard a
Martin bomber that flew  around the rim  of the country, starting at Bolling
Field on 24 July 1919. Totaling 100 flights and 9,823 miles, Dobias kept the
effort from ending almost before it began. Almost immediately after taking off
from Bolling, he crawled out on the aircraft's left wing, without a parachute,
to repair a leaky engine. In 1920, the Air Corps flew a round-trip flight of
four DH-4Bs from Mitchell Field on Long Island to Nome, Alaska. The flight took
three months and covered 9,000 miles and the safety record was largely
attributable to Master Sergeant Albert Vierra.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="195" height="144" src="afh1_files/image011.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.5.5. Toward the end of
the decade, Airmen were ready to demonstrate even more impressive records. New
Year's Day 1929, a team of Airmen destined for fame took off in a Fokker C-2
featuring a large question mark on the fuselage. The question was simple: how
long could they stay in the air? Using a crude air refueling technique
pioneered in 1923, Major Carl  Tooey  Spaatz, Capt Ira Eaker, Lieutenant Harry
Halverson, Lieutenant Elwood  Pete  Quesada, and Staff Sergeant Roy Hooe flew
the&nbsp;<i>Question Mark</i>&nbsp;150 hours and 40 minutes, taking on 5,600
gallons of hand-pumped fuel during 37 air-to air refuelings, to travel 11,000
miles. This endurance test proved the unlimited range available with air
refueling. The quest for world records in the 1920s honed the skills of Airmen,
advanced aviation technology, and kept military aviation in the limelight.</span></p>

<p><span>1.5.6. An important
group of demonstrations during the 1920s was more closely related to the
airplane as an advanced weapon of war. As early as the beginning of the decade,
Brigadier General Mitchell was convinced of airpower's potential as the primary
component of national defense and a war-winning weapon and aggressively
promoted his cause to create an independent Air Force. Hoping to make this the
nation's first line of defense, he challenged the United States Navy, arguing
that bombers rendered battleships obsolete. Reluctantly, the Navy agreed to
allow Mitchell to test his Martin MB-2 bombers against some captured German
ships. Mitchell's Airmen sank the 27,000-ton battleship,&nbsp;<i>Ostfriesland</i>&nbsp;on
21 July 1921. Despite the four-layer armored hull and watertight compartments,
the battleship eventually disappeared into the water. Although Mitchell failed
to convince the War or Navy departments, the bombing tests spurred
carrier-based aviation development.</span></p>



<p align="center"><span><img width="155" height="161" src="afh1_files/image012.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Aerial view of the&nbsp;<i>Ostfriesland</i></span></b></p>



<p><span>1.5.7. Despite previous
air service successes, the Navy remained unconvinced about their vulnerability
from the air. Officials eventually turned over two World War I battleships, the
USS&nbsp;<i>New Jersey</i>&nbsp;(BB-16) and the USS<i>&nbsp;Virginia,</i>&nbsp;for
further testing. A young bombardier, Sergeant Ulysses  Sam  Nero, earned a slot
among the 12 aircrews selected by General Mitchell to try to sink the
battleships.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="132" height="220" src="afh1_files/image013.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.5.8. On 5 September
1923, 11 aircraft reached the targets just off the North Carolina coast the
12th returned to base because of engine trouble. Ten of the aircraft dropped
their ordnance far from the&nbsp;<i>New Jersey.</i>&nbsp;Nero, using different
tactics than General Mitchell instructed, scored two hits. General Mitchell
disqualified Nero and his pilot from further competition but reconsidered when
the remainder of the crews failed to hit the&nbsp;<i>Virginia&nbsp;</i>until
they dropped down to 1,500 feet.</span></p>

<p><span>1.5.9.
Nero and the Martin-Curtiss NBS-1 pilot approached the&nbsp;<i>New Jersey</i>&nbsp;at
85 miles per hour at an altitude of 6,900 feet, from about 15 degrees off the
port beam. Using an open wire site, Nero dropped his first 600-pound bomb right
down the ship's smokestack. A delayed explosion lent suspense to the result,
but a billowing black cloud signaled the&nbsp;<i>New Jersey s</i>&nbsp;demise,
which went down in just over three minutes. Having one bomb left and no&nbsp;<i>New
Jersey</i>&nbsp;to drop it on, Nero's aircraft proceeded to the
floundering&nbsp;<i>Virginia,</i>&nbsp;where Nero proceeded to administer
the&nbsp;<i>coup de grace&nbsp;</i>on the stricken craft his bomb landed
directly on the&nbsp;<i>Virginia s</i>&nbsp;deck. General Mitchell promoted
Nero during the next cycle.</span></p>

<p><span>1.5.10. Frustrated by
what he perceived as a lack of progress, Mitchell's public statements were increasingly
incendiary. When the Navy airship&nbsp;<i>Shenandoah</i>&nbsp;crashed on 5
September 1925, Mitchell issued a press release charging the Department of the
Navy and the War Department with  incompetency, criminal negligence, and almost
treasonable administration of our national defense.  During the ensuing court
martial, Mitchell attempted to transform the trial into a public hearing on
airpower. Found guilty of  conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the
military service,  the court sentenced Mitchell to a five-year suspension from
the service without pay. On 1 February 1926, Mitchell resigned from the Air
Service to continue the fight for an independent air force. Until his death in
1936, Mitchell fought tenaciously for his vision. He placed his indelible stamp
on United States air combat practice and doctrine with his emphasis on massed
forces and offensive operations.</span></p>

<p><span>1.5.11. Mitchell s
efforts produced some success for the fledgling Air Corps. The Air Corps Act of
1926 greatly improved the status of aviation within the Army. This transformed
the Air Service into the Air Corps, provided representation on the General
Staff, added an Assistant Secretary of War for Air, and promised expansion to a
force of 1,650 officers, 15,000 enlisted men, and 1,800 serviceable aircraft
within five years. However, funding never matched the goal established.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.6. Air Corps Tactical School and the Rise of
the Bomber (1930s Air Corps):</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.6.1. Although
technological advances continued into the 1930s, the Great Depression dominated
the decade. The technological promise of all-metal construction, monoplane
design, and advanced power plants met the harsh realities of a shoe-string
budget caused by reduced tax revenues and economic malaise. Toward the latter
half of the decade, powerful totalitarian states, including Fascist Italy, Nazi
Germany, Nationalist Japan, and the Communist Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics, threatened western democracies, but powerful isolationist sentiment
limited the United States military response.</span></p>

<p><span>1.6.2. Within the Air
Corps, leading Airmen emphasized doctrinal development through the Air Corps
Tactical School. Doctrine, the concepts that are the basis of how to fight,
provided ideas for technological requirements, aircraft procurement, strategy,
and tactics. The Air Corps Tactical School served as the military aviation
doctrine center from their founding in 1920 as the Air Service Field Officer
School, Langley Field, Virginia. In 1922, the school was renamed the Air
Service Tactical School before becoming the Air Corps Tactical School in 1926.
Even before the Air Corps Tactical School moved to Maxwell Field, Alabama, in
1931, the school attracted the best and brightest Airmen to their faculty,
including Harold L. George, Kenneth Walker, Donald Wilson, George C. Kenney,
Haywood S. Hansell, and Muir S. Fairchild. Influenced by Billy Mitchell,
Italy's Giulio Douhet, and Britain's Hugh Trenchard, the Air Corps Tactical
School faculty emphasized long-range strategic bombardment.</span></p>

<p><span>1.6.3. According to Air
Corps Tactical School lectures, massed bombers would penetrate enemy defenses,
bypass field armies and navies, and strike enemy  vital centers' whose
destruction would collapse the enemy's economy. Proper target selection would
destroy an enemy's capability and will to fight. In an era before radar,
airpower theorists believed effective air defense would be impossible. They
looked to high altitude, speed, and internal armament for defense. These ideas
ultimately led United States Airmen to emphasize the high altitude precision
daylight bombardment that characterized much of the air operations during the
Second World War.</span></p>

<p><span>1.6.4. During the
interwar period, aircraft mechanics received formal technical training at
Chanute Field, Illinois, at what became the Air Corps Technical School in 1926.
Perhaps the key to the success of the technical school was the air service
system of trade testing. While other branches of the Army returned to the
apprentice system of assignment and training, the Army Air Corps continued to
use and develop a combination of the Army Alpha Test, aptitude tests, and
counseling. Enlisted men who wanted to apply for technical training had to
qualify as high school graduates or the equivalent and pass a mathematics
proficiency test in addition to the alpha test. Finally, a trade test
specialist familiar with the actual work personally interviewed each enlisted
man.</span></p>

<p><span>1.6.5. Classes at the
technical school started in the fall and usually continued until the following
spring. Students had to pay their own transportation to Illinois and, during
some periods, lived in relatively crude conditions. Still, the training grew in
popularity, and by 1938; the technical school had outgrown Chanute, with new
branches opening at Lowry Field near Denver, Colorado, and at Scott Field in
downstate Illinois.</span></p>

<p><span>1.6.6. Enlisted men
participated in a range of experimental work, including altitude flights, blind
flying, aerial photography, and cosmic ray research and the development of the
parachute. Whether they were selected as guinea pigs or because they were just
interested, enlisted men served as the first to try out new parachute designs,
and they eventually took over most of the testing and training. The most
prominent enlisted parachutist was Sergeant Ralph Bottriell who tested the
first backpack-style, freefall parachute on 19 May 1919. Bottriell eventually
became chief parachute instructor at Kelly Field, Texas, and earned the
Distinguished Flying Cross in 1933 for service as an experimental parachute
tester.&nbsp;</span></p>

Bottriell</span></b></p>

<p align="right"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.6.7. Coinciding with
Air Corps Tactical School doctrine, the American aviation industry introduced a
series of advanced bombers that encouraged airpower advocates. In 1931, the
Boeing Airplane Company introduced the B-9, an all-metal, stressed-skin bomber
with retractable landing gear capable of 188 mph. A few months later, the
Martin B-10 overshadowed the open-cockpit B-9. The B-10 also featured an all
metal, monoplane design with retractable landing gear, enclosed cockpit, a
glazed gun turret, variable pitch propellers, wing flaps, and an internal bomb
bay with power-driven doors. On 19 July 1934, Colonel Henry H.  Hap  Arnold led
a squadron of B-10s from Washington, District of Columbia, to Anchorage,
Alaska, covering 4,000 miles in 25 flying hours. Bomber theorists saw this
exploit as a validation of their ideas.</span></p>



<p><span>1.6.8. In February 1934,
a crisis arose that tested both the leadership and the flying skills of the Air
Corps when President Franklin D. Roosevelt cancelled airmail contracts with
civilian airlines. Without a thorough analysis of Air Corps capabilities,
General Foulois asserted that the Air Corps would pick up the slack until
contracts were renewed. However, the Air Corps underestimated the challenge
posed. Army Airmen attempted to fly mail routes in open-cockpit planes with
primitive instruments in one of the worst winters recorded. In three months,
the Air Corps lost 66 aircraft and suffered 18 fatalities. The airmail fiasco
forced Foulois to resign and led to a Congressional investigation known as the
Baker Board.</span></p>

<p><span>1.6.9. The Baker Board
scrutinized Air Corps operations and recommended the creation of a single
command for all combat aircraft, known as General Headquarters Air Force. Brig
Gen Frank Andrews assumed command 1 March 1935. Airmen applauded the action as
a means to consolidate command, centralize doctrine, and integrate training.
The initial cadre included 17 combat units: three wings, ten groups, and four
squadrons. Today's Air Combat Command traces their heritage to General
Headquarters Air Force. Among other measures, the General Headquarters Air
Force called for a bomber capable of carrying a 2,000-pound payload for 1,020
miles, at a speed of 200 mph. The Martin and Douglas companies advanced
designs, but the Boeing's Model 299 was what excited the General Headquarters
Air Force staff. In August 1935, the four-engine aircraft flew 2,100 miles
nonstop from Seattle, Washington, to Dayton, Ohio, averaging 232 mph. The B-17
 Flying Fortress,  paired with the Norden bombsight, revolutionized bombardment
and promised to validate Air Corps Tactical School theories. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>1.7. General Headquarters Air Force (1935-1939):</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.7.1. The resulting
reorganization established a General Headquarters Air Force (a measure that set
up a tactical air force under the direct control of the Army General
Headquarters but left the day-to-day organization of the Air Corps mostly
intact a confusing half-step toward an independent air force) and recognized
that technological advances in aircraft would eventually make air power a
significant military force apart from its early role of solely supporting
ground troops. The appearance of the B-17 bomber and the threat of global war
ushered in an era of greater expenditure, manpower expansion, and more
specialized and more sophisticated training.</span></p>

<p><span>1.7.2. The General
Headquarters Air Force resumed the practice of sending demonstration teams to
fairs and expositions and expanded the scope and scale of publicity flights to
include large gestures such as goodwill missions to South America. These
expeditions also provided opportunities to test the new long-range big bombers.
In February 1938, the air force flew six B-17s with full crews, including
enlisted men, to Buenos Aires to mark the inauguration of the new Argentine
president.</span></p>

<p><span>1.7.3 Even before the
actual outbreak of hostilities in Europe in the fall of 1939, the General
Headquarters Air Force had begun the massive expansion program that would
blossom during the following years into the largest air organization in the
Nation's history. In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked for an
appropriation of $300 million for military aviation. The Air Corps planned for
24 operational combat-ready groups by 1941, which called for greatly enhanced
manpower, training, and equipment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.8. The Air Corps Prepares for War.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In 1938, when the United States first took
seriously the signs of war in Europe, the army's air arm was still split into
two cumbersome command organizations, the Army Air Corps and General
Headquarters Air Force. The total force included less than 20,000 enlisted
Airmen. In 1940, Congress passed the first peacetime conscription law in United
States history. By March 1944 when the air force manpower reached their high
point, 2,104,405 enlisted men and women were serving in a virtually independent
branch of the armed services. Moreover, they operated a sophisticated machine
of air war that covered nearly the entire globe.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.9. Airpower in World War II: The European
Theater:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.9.1. If the First
World War signaled airpower's promise, the Second World War fulfilled the
vision. In every aspect of aerial combat, airpower served as a force multiplier
and a vital component of the joint, combined arms campaign. Air superiority
proved a prerequisite for successful land, sea, or air operations.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.2. On 1 September
1939, Adolf Hitler launched a massive assault on Poland that opened the
greatest war in history and spawned the term Blitzkrieg, or  lightning war. 
The German Air Force (<i>Luftwaffe</i>) employed Messerschmitt Me109 fighters
to gain air superiority; Heinkel He-111 and Dornier Do-17 twin-engined bombers
to pound Poland's capital, Warsaw; and Junkers Ju-87&nbsp;<i>Stuka</i>&nbsp;dive
bombers to attack Polish ground forces and terrorize refugees. Commanded by
Hermann G ring, the&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;emphasized speed and
concentration of forces to crush the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.3. In April 1940,
German forces surprised neutral Denmark and Norway, where&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;aircraft
inflicted significant damage to Britain's Royal Navy, protected inferior German
naval forces, and airlifted German troops to Norwegian airfields. In May,
Hitler's forces invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. The speed of the German
advance and the ruthlessness of the bombing of Rotterdam shocked the West.
German paratroopers and glider forces surprised Belgium's famed Eban Emael
fortress, considered the strongest in Europe. When German forces attacked
France, the&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;gained air superiority, masked the
movement of German panzers through the Ardennes forest, and hindered Allied
attempts to rally.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.4. Following the
defeat of France in June 1940, the victorious&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;faced
Britain's Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the first all-air campaign
in history. On paper, the&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;appeared to have a
decisive edge, with 1,232 medium bombers, 406 dive bombers, 813 single-engine
fighters, 282 twin-engine fighters, and 50 long-range reconnaissance aircraft
manned by experienced crews. Opposing them, Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding s
Fighter Command assembled 704 operational aircraft, including roughly 400
Hawker Hurricanes, suited for attacking bombers, and 200 Supermarine Spitfires,
a fighter equal to German Messerschmitts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.5. Despite the
apparent mismatch, the German Air Force suffered from serious weaknesses.
Substantial losses had eroded&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;strength; in
particular, the forces in France badly needed rest and refitting. Equally
significant, German training, equipment, and experience proved ill-suited for a
long-range strategic air campaign. Although the Me-109 was a superb fighter,
the short range limited the Me-109 combat time and tactical flexibility over
England. The long-range Me-110 proved hopelessly outclassed by Royal Air Force
Spitfires and Hurricanes. On the other hand, Dowding's Fighter Command had been
preparing for a German onslaught since 1937. Using Sir Robert Watson-Watt s
innovation, radar, the British created an effective, integrated air defense system.
Dowding also exploited a breakthrough in code breaking with the use of the
Enigma machine. Any information gained from Enigma was top secret and known as
ULTRA. This gave British intelligence forewarning of major attacks and
invaluable insight on the status of German maintenance and logistics.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.6. Plagued by poor
intelligence, G ring and other&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;leaders
miscalculated, leading to a battle of attrition won by the Royal Air Force.
Failing to appreciate the value of British radar stations, the Germans first
attacked Royal Air Force airfields and then after the Royal Air Force bombed
Berlin 24 August,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>switched to a terror bombing campaign against
London. Against German losses of 1,733 aircraft, the Royal Air Force lost 915
planes. By 15 September 1940, Hitler abandoned his planned invasion of Britain.
In tribute to the Royal Air Force Fighter Command, Prime Minister Winston
Churchill stated,  Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so
many to so few. </span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="302" height="241" src="afh1_files/image017.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.9.7. The fall of France
in June 1940 galvanized President Franklin Roosevelt's resolve to fight Nazi
tyranny. Knowing the isolationist sentiment of many Americans, Roosevelt turned
to airpower as a major weapon. The President called for American industry to
build 50,000 military aircraft. Considering that in 1939, the United States
Army Air Corps numbered roughly 1,800 aircraft and 18,000 men, this figure
stunned air leaders and industrialists alike. American industry proved equal to
the task, but aeronautical designs, blueprints, tools, dies, air frames, and
engines, not to mention factories, skilled workers, and the countless other
components of an aviation industry required time to develop. Air logisticians
such as Major General Oliver P. Echols began the most massive aircraft
procurement program in history. Until December 1940, the United States built
aircraft at a rate of only 800 per month. By 1942, American factories produced
47,800 aircraft, and by 1944, an astronomical 96,300 planes. American
industrial production emerged as a key to Allied victory.</span></p>



<p><span>1.9.8. To manage growing
American airpower, a major reorganization created the United States Army Air
Forces. General Henry  Hap  Arnold was appointed Commanding General of the
United States Army Air Forces and Deputy Chief of Staff, Air Force to General
George C. Marshall. In August 1941, a group of ex-Air Corps Tactical School
instructors created a doctrinal blueprint, Air War Planning Document 1, for the
conduct of a strategic air campaign against the Axis. Led by Lieutenant Colonel
Harold  Hal  George, Major Lawrence Kuter, Major Kenneth Walker, and Captain
Haywood  Possum  Hansell, the team created the conceptual framework for the
American air effort in World War II. Reflecting 1930s Air Corps Tactical School
doctrine of using massive force to destroy the enemy's will and capability to
fight through long-range strategic bombardment, Air War Planning Document 1
called for 239 combat groups; 26,416 combat aircraft, including 7,500 heavy
bombers; 37,051 training planes; 150,000 trained aircrews; and 2.2 million
personnel.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.9.9. On 7 December
1941,  a date which will live in infamy,  Imperial Japan dealt a devastating
blow to the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Two waves of 350
Japanese aircraft sank or heavily damaged all eight United States battleships.
Concerned over the prospect of sabotage, the United States Army ground
commander ordered United States Army Air Forces aircraft parked in tight rows
that made prime targets for Japanese aviators. To make matters worse, a few
hours later, Japanese forces caught United States aircraft on the ground
refueling in the Philippines and destroyed&nbsp; B-17s and assorted fighters.
On 8 December, the United States declared war on Japan; three days later,
Germany and Italy were at war with the United States as allies of Japan.
Despite the fact the attack on Pearl Harbor was what formally brought the
United States into the war, the war in Europe and the defeat of Germany would
take precedence.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.10. As America
entered the war, the Royal Air Force tried to persuade the United States Army
Air Forces to switch to night operations, like those of Royal Air Force Bomber
Command. Under Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, Royal Air Force bombing doctrine
embraced night area bombing of German cities to displace German workers. To
United States Army Air Forces leaders, night bombing was ineffective,
inefficient, and indiscriminate with regard to civilian casualties. After tough
negotiations, the Casablanca Directive of January 1943 inaugurated the Combined
Bomber Offensive, codenamed Operation POINTBLANK, combining American precision
daylight bombing and British night area bombing.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.11. In February
1942, Brig Gen Ira C. Eaker established the VIII Bomber Command, flying from
bases in England in preparation for the United States Army Air Forces buildup.
General Spaatz assumed command of the  Mighty Eighth  in June 1942. On 17
August 1942, a dozen B-17Es from the 97th Bomb Group conducted the first
American operational bombing mission. The strike against a railroad marshalling
yard in Rouen, France, barely penetrated the German defenses, but the mission
and a series of others known as the  Freshman Raids' showed promise for
American daylight bombardment.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="320" height="197" src="afh1_files/image018.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.9.12. Three disastrous
missions in the late summer and fall of 1943 illustrated United States Army Air
Forces theory flaws. Eager to strike Hitler's oil supply, 177 B-24 Liberators
based in North Africa attacked oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania, on 1 August
1943. Ploesti was one of the most heavily defended targets in Europe, so
success depended on a 2,700-mile flight (much at low-level to avoid radar
detection), accurate open-water navigation, good weather, and surprise. But a
combination of bad weather, human error, and bad luck scattered the bomber
formations and resulted in a nightmare for surviving crews. As the careful plan
imploded, bombers improvised striking targets of opportunity in the face of
determined fighter opposition and hundreds of anti-aircraft guns. The attacking
force lost 54 B-24s; 41 in combat. Of the 177 aircraft, only 30 emerged
unscathed. Although the strike reduced oil-refining capacity by 40 percent,
within a few days a new facility opened, negating the damage.</span></p>



<p><span>1.9.13. After finally
assembling enough trained crews to strike deep into Germany, Eighth Air Force
planners targeted German ball bearing factories in an effort to destroy a
 vital center  in the enemy's industrial web. They devised an ambitious double
raid upon the Messerschmitt aircraft factory at Regensburg and the top-priority
Schweinfurt ball bearing plants. The plan called for a wave of the 3d Air
Division to fight through German fighters, hit Regensburg, and proceed to North
Africa to land, followed 30 minutes later by a second bomber wave that would
strike Schweinfurt as German fighters on the ground rearmed and refueled.</span></p>



<p><span>1.9.14. On 17 August
1943, General LeMay's 3d Air Division launched the first wave. Thick fog
delayed the second wave and prevented fighter escorts from taking off. When the
fog lifted, almost the entire German fighter force pounced upon the ill-fated
1st Air Division. The Eighth Air Force staggered under the loss of 60 out of
361 B-17s and 600 trained aircrew members, more casualties in a day than during
the previous six months. To make matters worse, the Schweinfurt ball bearing
plants required reattack.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.15. Known as  Black
Thursday,  the 14 October 1943 mission against Schweinfurt effectively ended
the United States Army Air Forces unescorted bombing campaign. Determined to
destroy the top priority target, General Eaker ordered 291 B-17s to run the
gauntlet of German fighters. This time, bombing accuracy improved significantly
and the mission severely damaged the factories, but another 60 bombers were
shot down; seven were destroyed upon landing in England, and 138 B-17s suffered
battle damage.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.16. While
warplanners devoted the bulk of American airpower to daylight strategic
bombing, in October 1943, heavily modified, mission-unique bombers from the
Special Flight Section, 5th Bombardment Wing, Twelfth Air Force, along with
England-based 801st Bombardment Group  Carpetbaggers,  provided clandestine
support for allied partisans and guerilla units in occupied territories,
rescuing hundreds of downed aircrews trapped behind enemy lines.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.17. Some
technological and production breakthroughs reversed the course of the air war
over the winter of 19431944. During the initial campaigns, effective long-range
escort fighters appeared to be technically impossible. In order to carry the
fuel necessary for long-range flight, fighters required at least twin engines,
but the increased size sacrificed speed and maneuverability. The long-range
Lockheed P-38 Lightning offered a partial solution, but the P-38's performance
lagged at high altitudes. In mid-1943, the United States Army Air Forces
introduced 75-gallon, and later 108-gallon, drop tanks that extended the combat
radius of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter from 175 miles to 280 miles and
325 miles, respectively. The P-47's extended range proved an important step,
but only a partial answer to the escort problem.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.18. The North
American Aviation P-51 Mustang revolutionized the air war over Europe. Designed
in only 100 days during the spring of 1940, the Mustang was to supplement the
Royal Air Force's Spitfire. The initial Allison engine for the P-51 proved
inadequate; but when the Spitfire's Rolls-Royce Merlin engine replaced the
original power plant, the results stunned aviators. At 440 mph, the P-51B was
faster and could out turn and out dive the latest models of Me-109 and the new
Focke-Wulf FW-190. With a basic range of 500 miles, augmentable to 850 miles,
the Mustang flew farther than a B-17 with normal payload. Introduced in
December 1943, the P-51 had to wait until late February 1944 before weather
permitted full flight operations and was a technological marvel: a plane with a
bomber's range and a fighter's performance.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.19. The P-47 and
P-51 team seized the air superiority from the&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;in the
spring of 1944. Complementing the technological improvements, Allied factories
poured out large numbers of new aircraft and stateside training bases produced
well-trained air crews. At the helm of the VIII Fighter Command, Brigadier
General William E. Kepner maximized his advantage by introducing new tactics.
Fighters would no longer be required to  stick to the bombers.  Numerical
superiority permitted fighter sweeps and aggressive scouting; superior range
allowed fighters to strafe German airfields and attack targets of opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.20. Armed with new
aircraft, tactics, and superior numbers, Spaatz, Doolittle, and Kepner launched
Operation ARGUMENT with the objective of winning air superiority and crippling
Germany's aircraft industry. Between 20 and 25 February 1944, the 8th Air Force
flew 3,300 heavy bomber sorties; the Fifteenth Air Force added 500 missions
from Italy; and Royal Air Force Bomber Command flew 2,750 night attacks aimed
at German aircraft manufacturing plants. Protecting them involved nearly 4,000
fighter sorties. At a cost of 226 American bombers, 114 British heavies, and 41
United States Army Air Forces fighters, Operation ARGUMENT destroyed 355&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;fighters,
damaged 155 fighters, and killed 400 fighter pilots. Although the&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;replaced
its aircraft, it could not replace the 2,262 experienced pilots killed in the
five months preceding D-Day, the invasion of Normandy.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="192" height="171" src="afh1_files/image019.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="209" height="178" src="afh1_files/image020.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.9.21. By 6 June 1944,
Allied air forces dominated the skies of Europe. On the first day of the
invasion, the Allies directed 8,722 United States Army Air Forces and 5,676
Royal Air Force sorties against German defenses in France. In response, the
once vaunted&nbsp;<i>Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;could launch fewer than 100 sorties and
only two German aircraft inflicted damage on the invasion beaches. Allied
bombers and fighters trumped the German integrated air defense network.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.22. After the
Normandy invasion, the Combined Bomber Offensive devastated Germany.
Approximately 75 percent of the 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped were after
June 1944. In contrast to the horrific losses experienced at Schweinfurt,
Regensburg, and Ploesti in 1943, American losses fell to  acceptable  rates. By
1945, some raids reported negligible losses: one bomber lost out of 1,094 sent
to Kassel, five out of 1,310 at ChemnitzMagdeburg, and zero losses out of 1,219
at Nuremburg. At its peak, the United States Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force
massed 7,904 heavy bombers in the theater and 28,000 combat planes total. By 16
April 1945, General Spaatz declared the strategic air war against Germany ended
since all significant targets were considered destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.23. From 1942 to
1945, the Combined Bomber Offensive was the longest, bloodiest, air campaign in
history. According to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, the Allies
flew 1.69 million combat sorties and dropped 1.5 million tons of bombs, killing
and wounding more than a million Germans, and destroying 3.6 million buildings:
20 percent of the nation's total. Airpower emerged as a dominant weapon in
Western Europe during World War II.</span></p>



<p align="center"><span><img width="136" height="228" src="afh1_files/image021.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.9.24. Enlisted
personnel served with honor throughout World War II. For example, a raid
against the last operational Nazi oil refinery on 15 March 1945 was successful,
but cost the life of one of the enlisted force's most decorated Airmen.
Sergeant Sandy Sanchez flew 44 missions as a gunner with the 95th Bomb Group,
19 more than required to complete his tour. After returning home for a brief
period, rather than accept an assignment as a gunnery instructor, he returned
to Europe. Flying with the 353d Bombardment Squadron in Italy, Sanchez s
aircraft was hit by ground fire. Nine of the 10-member crew bailed out
successfully, but Sanchez never made it from the stricken aircraft. Sanchez was
the only enlisted airman to have a B-17 named for him.</span></p>

<p><span>1.9.25. At the age of
20, on a mission to bomb the oil refineries outside Vienna, Technical Sergeant
Paul Airey and his fellow crewmen were shot down on their 28th mission. He was
held as a prisoner of war for 10 months, surviving a 90-day march from the
Baltic Sea to Berlin before being liberated by the British Army in 1945.
Promoted to Chief Master Sergeant in 1962, Airey became the first Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force in 1967. In 1988, he received the first Air Force
prisoner of war medal.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 1D Tuskegee
Airmen, Air War in the Pacific, Air Force Independence, Cold War, and Cuban
Missile Crisis</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>1.10. The Tuskegee Airmen:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.10.1. In 1941,
President Franklin D. Roosevelt directed the Army Air Corps to accept black
Americans into aviation cadet training. The Air Corps, like all other
components of the United States Armed Forces, decided to segregate black
aviators into all-black squadrons. By the end of World War II, nearly a
thousand black Americans had earned their wings as Army flyers. Fired by a
determination to prove their patriotism, valor, and skill in combat, these
black aviators, forever called the Tuskegee Airmen, struck a significant blow
against racism in America.</span></p>



<p align="center"><span><img width="140" height="231" src="afh1_files/image022.jpg" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="202" height="177" src="afh1_files/image023.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.10.2. The first
Tuskegee Airmen to fight were members of the 99th Fighter Squadron, a unit
commanded by black West Point graduate and future Air Force general officer,
Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. On 27 January 1944, over Anzio, pilots from the
99th Fighter Squadron, flying obsolete P-40s, downed nine superior Focke-Wulf
190s. As the 99th Fighter Squadron continued scoring kills, the 332d Fighter
Group, another unit manned by Tuskegee Airmen, arrived in Italy with obsolete
P-39 ground-attack fighters. In the spring of 1944, these segregated units
transitioned to P-47 Thunderbolts and to P-51 Mustangs a month later, when they
began flying bomber escort missions.</span></p>

<p><span>1.10.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The 332d Fighter Group flew escort missions from 9 June 1944 until
the German surrender in the spring of 1945. By a large margin, the Tuskegee
Airmen destroyed more aircraft than they lost. They shot down 111 enemy
aircraft in air-to-air combat, losing 66 of their own aircraft to all causes,
including seven shot down. A tribute to their skill, courage, and
determination, the Tuskegee Airmen amassed a distinguished combat record on 200
escort missions into Germany.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.10.4. While the 332d
Fighter Group fought in Europe, the segregated 477th Bomb Group, manned by
Tuskegee Airmen, was activated in 1944, at Selfridge Field, Michigan. Their
ability to prepare for war was hampered by frequent relocations and
segregation-imposed training barriers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Nevertheless, the Tuskegee
Airmen struck a significant blow to the poison of racism in America, fighting
bigotry by their actions in the skies over North Africa, the Mediterranean,
Sicily, Italy, Austria, Yugoslavia, France, Romania, and Germany. With their
record, they dispelled myths, opened eyes, rewrote history, and prepared the
United States Air Force to be the first armed service to integrate racially.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.11. Air War in the Pacific:</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="174" height="174" src="afh1_files/image024.png" ></span><b><span>&nbsp; </span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Flying Tiger P-40</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="243" height="178" src="afh1_files/image025.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.11.1.
America's first combat experience in the Pacific Theater of World War II
occurred before the declaration of war. In early 1941, former Air Corps
Tactical School instructor Claire Lee Chennault organized the American
volunteer group, known as the  Flying Tigers,  to aid Nationalist China against
Japanese invaders. Famous for shark mouths painted on their Curtis P-40
Warhawks, the Flying Tigers amassed an impressive 286 confirmed victories,
losing only 12 pilots, before being disbanded in July 1942.</span></p>

<p><span>1.11.2. The Japanese
forces appeared invincible during the first six months of conflict, and America
needed a strong offensive strike against the Japanese to boost sagging morale.
On 18 April 1942, Lieutenant Colonel James  Jimmy  Doolittle led 16 North
American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers, launching from the carrier USS&nbsp;<i>Hornet</i>,
in a bombing raid on various targets in Tokyo, Kobe, and Nagoya. The Doolittle
Raid inflicted little damage, but the gesture shocked Japanese military leaders
and cheered the American public. Upon his return to the United States in May
1942, Doolittle received the Medal of Honor and promotion to brigadier
general.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.11.3. Not many fliers
have had a popular song written about them, but an exception was a soft-spoken
United States Army Air Force enlisted man, John D. Foley. Although he never received
aerial gunnery training, he volunteered as a gunner and was assigned to a B-26
crew. On his first mission, Foley shot down at least one Japanese enemy
aircraft. Other 19th Bomb Squadron members confirmed his victory and he was
nicknamed  Johnny Zero  by a war correspondent. Corporal Foley became a hero
and the subject of a popular song,  Johnny Got a Zero.  Commercial firms
capitalized on his fame and produced such items as  Johnny Zero  watches and
boots. During his 31 other Pacific combat missions, Foley shared in the
destruction of at least six more enemy aircraft and survived three crashes.
Malaria forced his return to the United States in 1943 where he toured
factories promoting war production. He volunteered to fly again and completed
31 missions over Europe. He returned to the United States again and was
preparing for a third overseas tour when World War II ended. But before the war
ended, Foley became an Army Air Force legend by being decorated a total of
eight times for heroism including personal recognition by Generals MacArthur,
Eisenhower, and Doolittle.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.11.4. Naval aviation
played a vital role in the Pacific War. Under the leadership of Admirals
Chester Nimitz, Frank  Jack  Fletcher, Raymond Spruance, and William  Bull 
Halsey, United States carrier-based aviation proved the value of airpower at
sea. The Battle of Coral Sea, fought 4-8 May 1942, marked the first naval
battle fought entirely by air. At the Battle of Midway, 4 June 1942, United
States Navy pilots sank four Japanese carriers and turned the tide of the war
in the Pacific.</span></p>



<p><span>1.11.5. The primary
United States Army Air Forces contribution to the Pacific counterattack was
made by the Fifth Air Force, attached to the Southwest Pacific Theater under
General Douglas MacArthur's command. While Admiral Nimitz  carrier task forces
struck from the Central Pacific, MacArthur's command thrust across New Guinea
toward the Philippines. Because of the  Europe First  strategy, Fifth Air Force
flew second string aircraft out of primitive bases, struggling to overcome its
low resource priority level and a 10,000 mile supply chain.</span></p>

<p><span>1.11.6. In July 1942,
Major General George C. Kenney assumed command of the Fifth Air Force. Kenney
maximized the resource-poor command's combat power. In a theater where range
dominated employment decisions, Kenney used the Lockheed P-38 Lightning with
locally developed 150-gallon drop tanks. Kenney encouraged an ingenious
subordinate, Maj Paul  Pappy  Gunn, to mount quad .50-caliber machine guns in
the nose of A-20 and B-25 aircraft, creating deadly attack planes. Other Fifth
Air Force innovations included parachutes attached to fragmentation bombs and
low-level  skip  bombing techniques.</span></p>

<p><span>1.11.7. An even lower a
priority than Fifth Air Force, Allied forces in the China-Burma-India Theater
faced logistical challenges at the end of the war's longest supply chain.
Called to transport vital supplies across the Himalayas, Air Transport Command
crews, flying C-46s and C-47s, braved perilous weather conditions to deliver
650,000 tons of supplies to Chinese and American forces. Flying the  Hump  was
one of the most hazardous military air operations of World War II. Enterprise
architect William H. Tunner developed many maintenance and cargo-handling
techniques that later proved invaluable during the Berlin Airlift.</span></p>

<p><span>1.11.8. In addition to
Air Transport Command efforts in the China-Burma-India Theater, the 1st Air
Commando Group, led by Lieutenant Colonel Phillip G. Cochran and John R.
Allison, provided assistance to British  Chindit  forces conducting long-range
penetration missions against the Japanese during Operation Thursday, using
unconventional air warfare to support British ground forces. America's first
Air Commandos demonstrated that air power could support unconventional warfare
any place, any time. The 1st Air Commando Group also demonstrated its
ingenuity, conducting the first helicopter combat rescue.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="207" height="174" src="afh1_files/image026.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.11.9. Allied soldiers,
sailors, and marines pushed back the borders of the Japanese empire and airmen
sought to destroy Japan through strategic bombardment. General Arnold hoped to
clinch victory through airpower alone in order to avoid a costly land invasion.
In November 1939, Air Corps leaders selected the primary campaign instrument:
the Boeing XB-29. With a pressurized crew compartment, remotely controlled
guns, and new radial engines, the B-29 was an aircraft of unprecedented size
and capability. The United States Army Air Forces ordered 1,664 before the
prototype had even flown. The rush to produce the plane led to substantial
technical problems. Nevertheless, by April 1944, B-29s appeared in the
China-Burma-India to conduct Operation MATTERHORN, the designation for B-29
operations out of bases in India and China to carry out strategic bombing of
Japanese force.</span></p>



<p><span>1.11.10. At first, XX
Bomber Command crews attempted to reproduce high-altitude daylight precision
bombing, with disappointing results. Flying from bases in China with logistical
staging from India, XX Bomber Command engine problems were amplified by distance
and weather. By October 1944, B-29 operations shifted to Saipan, significantly
reducing supply lines. Former Air Corps Tactical School instructor Haywood S.
Hansell renewed efforts for a daylight precision bombing campaign. Impatient
with the results, General Arnold replaced Hansell in January 1945 with Major
General Curtis E. LeMay, a proven combat commander from the European theater.</span></p>

<p><span>1.11.11. LeMay
drastically altered B-29 tactics. To avoid the jet stream and high-altitude
engine problems, LeMay ordered low-altitude night attacks with bombers stripped
of defensive machine guns, reduced fuel loads, and increased bomb loads. Much
like the Royal Air Force, LeMay's B-29s relied on darkness for protection and
pummeled enemy cities with incendiary bombs. From March-August 1945, American
firebomb raids destroyed 66 Japanese cities and burned 178 square miles of
urban landscape. Civilian casualties were severe; in one raid against Tokyo an
estimated 80,000 people perished.</span></p>

<p><span>1.11.12. Following a
successful atomic test on 18 July 1945, the Allied powers issued an ultimatum
on 26 July calling for the Japanese government to surrender or suffer  prompt
and utter destruction.  Specially modified B-29s from the 393d Bombardment
Squadron, a component of the 509th Composite Group, delivered the first
operational atomic bombs. On 6 August 1945, Colonel Paul Tibbets piloted the
Enola Gay which dropped a uranium bomb, known as</span></p>

<p><span> Little Boy,  over
Hiroshima destroying nearly five square miles of the city and killing 80,000 people.
Japan did not surrender. On 9 August 1945, the B-29 Bockscar, commanded by
Major Charles W. Sweeney, released a plutonium bomb called  Fat Man  on
Nagasaki. Because Nagasaki was partially protected by hilly terrain, the bomb
devastated 1.5 square miles, killed 35,000, and injured 60,000. Faced with a
defeated army, destroyed navy and air force, burned cities, a declaration of
war by the Soviet Union, and atomic weapons, the Japanese government
surrendered 14 August 1945. In the Pacific Theater, airpower proved even more
decisive than in Europe. The industrial might of the United States overwhelmed
Japanese forces. The geographic circumstances and immense distances involved
made airpower the preeminent weapon.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="248" height="412" src="afh1_files/image028.jpg" ></span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>1.12. Air Force Independence and the Cold War:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.12.1. With victory in
World War II, the American public returned to normal life. Airpower and
military affairs, in general, decreased in importance. From a wartime strength
of more than 79,000 aircraft and 2.4 million people, forces dwindled to 24,000
aircraft and 304,000 people by May 1947. Nevertheless, airpower's impact on
warfare led to the realization of Billy Mitchell's dream. On 26 July 1947,
President Harry S. Truman signed into law the National Security Act of 1947,
which provided for a separate Department of the Air Force. On 18 September
1947, Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the Air Force and
officially established the United States Air Force as an independent, coequal
service. Under the leadership of General Spaatz as the first Chief of Staff,
Air Force and that of his successor, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, the Air Force
clarified roles and missions and organized to meet the challenges of the
growing Cold War.</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.2. In many areas,
the establishment of the Air Force had little impact on the lives of most
Airmen until months or even years had passed. What were designated as  organic 
service units were taken over as newly designated Air Force units. Units that
provided a common service to both the Army and the Air Force were left intact.
Until 1950, for example, if an Airman became seriously ill, he was likely
treated by Army doctors in an Army hospital. There was also, at first, no
change in appearance. The distinctive blue uniforms of the United States Air
Force were introduced only after large stocks of Army clothing were used up.
Familiar terms slowly gave way to new labels. By 1959, enlisted Airmen ate in
 dining halls' rather than  mess halls,  were eyed warily by  air police 
instead of  military police,  and bought necessities at the  base exchange 
instead of the  post exchange. </span></p>

<p><span>1.12.3.
Initially, the enlisted rank system remained as it had been in the United
States Army Air Force. Corporal was removed from NCO status in 1950. Then, in
1952, the Air Force officially changed the names of the lower four ranks from
private to Airman basic; private first class to Airman, third class; corporal
to Airman, second class; and sergeant to Airman, first class. These changes
were in response to a development that surfaced during World War II, and the
rank structure would continue to evolve over time. Promotion and specialization
went hand-in-hand with training in the new Air Force. When the new organization
established Air Force specialty codes as standard designations for functional
and technical specialties, qualification for an advanced Air Force specialty
code became part of the criteria for promotion. During the late 1940s, the Air
Force also began an Airman Career Program that attempted to encourage long term
careers for enlisted specialists.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.12.4. The Berlin
Crisis awakened Americans to the impact of the Cold War between the United
States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. On 24 June 1948, the
Soviets blockaded railroad and road corridors serving the 2.5 million residents
of West Berlin, deep within Communist East Germany. United States Air Forces in
Europe Commander General LeMay organized a makeshift airlift of food, medicine,
and coal. United States Air Forces in Europe C-47 and C-54 cargo aircraft
established a precise schedule of flights every three minutes, 24-hours-a-day.
After the first month, Major General William H. Tunner assumed command of an
expanded effort that would include 300 American and 100 British aircraft flown
by aircrews who would apply lessons learned while flying the  Hump  during
World War II. On 15 April 1949, 1,398 aircraft delivered a one-day record
12,941 tons of supplies. By 1949, the Soviets acknowledged the airlift s
success and lifted the blockade. Operation VITTLES tallied 277,804 flights
delivering 2.3 million tons of supplies. This nonviolent use of airpower<b>&nbsp;</b>defused
a potentially disastrous confrontation.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="169" height="205" src="afh1_files/image029.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Berlin airlift</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.12.5. Throughout the
airlift, enlisted personnel served as cargo managers and loaders (with a major
assist from German civilians), air traffic controllers, communications
specialists, and weather and navigation specialists. Of all the enlisted
functions, perhaps the most critical to the success of the airlift was
maintenance. The Soviets' eventual capitulation and dismantling of the surface
blockade represented one of the great Western victories of the cold war without
a bomb having been dropped and laid the foundation for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.6. The 1948 Berlin
Crisis and 1949 Soviet detonation of an atomic device motivated the Air Force
to improve war readiness. As the new Strategic Air Command commander, General
LeMay emphasized rigorous training, exacting performance standards, and
immediate readiness. In the late 1940s, SAC incorporated the B-50 (a more
powerful version of the B-29) and the massive Convair B-36 Peacemaker (the
first bomber with intercontinental range) into the inventory. Behind the
scenes, the Air Force conducted a highly secret, extensive electronic
reconnaissance program that included covert flights over the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republic to assess Communist air defenses.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.7. Jet aircraft
technological breakthroughs changed the face of aviation. Although the Bell
XP-59 Airacomet first flew 1 October 1942, the Lockheed P-80 (later
redesignated F-80) entered service in December 1945 as the Air Force's first
operational jet fighter. On 14 October 1947, Charles  Chuck  Yeager seized
headlines as the first man to break the sound barrier. His Bell X-1  Glamorous Glennis 
reached Mach 1.06 at 43,000 feet after a launch from a B-29 mother ship. In the
early 1950s, Strategic Air Command upgraded to an all-jet bomber force,
activating the Boeing B-47 Stratojet and the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="185" height="150" src="afh1_files/image030.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="198" height="149" src="afh1_files/image031.png" ></span></p>



<p><span>1.12.8.
On 25 June 1950, Communist North Korea launched a massive invasion of&nbsp;</span><b><span>X-1 and the B-29</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><span>United States-backed South Korea. Three days later, American B-26
bombers attacked advancing North Korean troops in the first major flare-up of
the Cold War. For six weeks, Far East Air Forces, commanded by Lieutenant
General George E. Stratemeyer, gained air superiority to help United Nations
forces shut down the North Korean assault. The initial phase of the Korean War
illustrated the dangers of being unprepared, as American Airmen struggled to
relearn close air support and interdiction skills. In addition, the F-80 s
limited range inhibited the time over target required for tactical operations.
About 100 Far East Air Forces Bomber Command B-29s conducted strategic
operations to destroy the enemy's will and capacity to fight. Although United
Nations forces controlled the skies and destroyed North Korea's industrial
base, multiple limitations frustrated hopes of decisive victory.</span></p>



<p><span>1.12.9. General
MacArthur's amphibious assault at Inchon and successive operations shattered
the North Korean Army, but the United Nations advance into North Korea led to
Communist Chinese intervention. The entry of half a million Chinese troops in
November 1950 drastically changed the war. Within weeks, advanced Soviet-made
MiG-15 fighters appeared. Flown by North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet pilots,
the MiG-15 outperformed American F-51, F-80, and F-84 aircraft. Lieutenant
Russell Brown, flying an F-80C, shot down a MiG-15 in the world's first all-jet
air battle on 8 November 1950. In response to the enemy's superior speed and
altitude, Air Force leaders rushed the North American F-86 Sabre into action.
The F-86 matched the MiG's speed and proved a more stable gun platform.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="167" height="221" src="afh1_files/image032.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="269" height="186" src="afh1_files/image033.png" ></span></p>



<p><span>1.12.10. On 9 November
1950, Corporal Harry LaVene of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron,
serving as gunner, scored the first B-29 victory over a jet by downing a
MiG-15. LaVene's victory was the first of 27 MiGs shot down by B-29 gunners
during the course of the war. Sergeant Billie Beach, a tail gunner on an
Okinawa-based B-29, shot down two MiGs on 12 April 1951, a feat unmatched by
any other gunner. His own plane was so shot up, however, that it and the crew
barely survived an emergency landing with collapsed gear at an advanced fighter
strip.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.11. As the war on
the ground settled into stalemate, F-86s battled over  MiG Alley,  where
superior training and experience prevailed. F-86 pilots destroyed 792 MiGs and
18 other enemy aircraft at a cost of 76 Sabres lost to MiGs, and 142 to other
causes.</span></p>



<p><span>1.12.12. During the
Korean War, the Air Rescue Service medically evacuated more than 9,600 wounded
soldiers, and rescued nearly 1,000 personnel shot down over enemy territory. In
addition, Air Resupply and Communication Service wings executed unconventional
warfare and counterinsurgency operations against enemy forces.</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.13. During the
Korean War, a new group of Air Force pilots entered the pantheon of fighter
aces. The F-86 pilots established a remarkable 10-to-1 kill ratio. Captain
Joseph McConnell, a B-24 navigator in World War II, led the pack with a score
of 16, closely followed by Captain James Jabara who tallied 15 kills. Jabara
gained recognition as the world's first jet ace. Unlike the mass squadron
formations often flown in World War II, Korean War pilots devised new tactics
based on flights of only four F-86s.</span></p>



<p><span>1.12.14. Despite success
in the air war, the Korean War frustrated American airpower. Accustomed to the
commitment of World War II, Korean War era leaders struggled under political,
technological, and resource limitations inherent in the Cold War. Worried that
the conflict in Korea foreshadowed a Soviet invasion of Europe, American policy
makers limited operations in Asia in order to build up North Atlantic Treaty
Organization forces. Nevertheless, United Nations forces repelled two communist
invasions of South Korea, and American airpower secured the skies against enemy
air attack.</span></p>



<p><span>1.12.15. After the
Korean conflict, Air Force missile and space capabilities developed rapidly. In
late 1953, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development,
Trevor Gardner, convened a group of experts known as the</span></p>

<p><span>Teapot Committee to
examine the field of long-range missiles. The committee's 10 February 1954
report recommended accelerating intercontinental ballistic missile development.
Based on the recommendation, the Air Research and Development Command, on 1
July 1954, established the Western Development Division in Inglewood,
California, to develop and field intercontinental ballistic missiles. On 2
August 1954, Brigadier General Bernard Schriever assumed command of the new
organization.</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.16. Concurrent with
efforts to develop long-range missiles, the United States also pursued space-based
technology that could provide accurate information on Soviet military
intentions. On 27 November 1954, Air Force senior leaders followed the
recommendation of the RAND Corporation's Project Feed Back report, issuing
Weapon System Requirement No. 5, directing development of an electro-optical
reconnaissance satellite. Weapon System Requirement No. 5 later became weapon
system 117L. The scope of weapon system 117L eventually broadened to include
other space-based missions, such as meteorology, missile warning, and
multispectral imaging.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.17. On 4 October
1957, the course of missile and satellite development changed when the Soviet
Union successfully launched the Sputnik I satellite into earth orbit. The
Soviet success marked the beginning of the space age and sparked the space race
between the United States and Soviet Union. Over the next two decades the Air
Force played a major role in the developing national space programs, assuming
the mantle of America's air and space force. In response to the Sputnik I
launch, President Eisenhower accelerated United States civil and military space
efforts; a decision that would prove crucial throughout the Cold War.</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.18. In 1958, the
Air Force developed plans for a manned military presence in space, but President
Eisenhower reserved manned missions for the National Aeronautics and Space
Agency. However, the Air Force's plan formed the basis of the Mercury, Gemini,
and Apollo Programs. The Atlas rocket, which began as a United States Army Air
Corps ballistic missile in October 1945, was used to launch the MERCURY
missions. The Titan-II booster, also originally a ballistic missile, launched
the Gemini astronauts. In fact, the Air Force and its contractors planned,
built, and launched all of the Titan-II rockets in Project Gemini.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="153" height="197" src="afh1_files/image034.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><sup><span>Atlas rocket launching</span></sup></b></p>

<p><span>1.12.19. In 1960, the
National Reconnaissance Office was formed to take charge of highly classified
reconnaissance satellites. President Eisenhower undertook several initiatives
to help prevent a surprise nuclear attack against the United States, including
establishing the classified Corona satellite photo reconnaissance program. This
system, known publicly as the Discoverer research program, achieved its first
successful launch of the Discoverer XIII, 10 August 1960. Corona employed a
payload capsule that jettisoned from the orbiter, returned to earth by
parachute, and was captured by an aircraft. Discoverer XIV, launched a week
after recovering Discoverer XIII, shot over 3,000 feet of reconnaissance film
from space, heralding the beginning of America's space-based photo
reconnaissance capability.</span></p>

<p><span>1.12.20. The Air Force
concentrated on unmanned missions to fulfill national security needs. Space
reconnaissance satellites, for instance, supported strategic deterrence throughout
the Cold War, providing invaluable knowledge of the Soviet Union's nuclear
inventory, and verifying arms control treaty compliance. Space systems also
provided early warning of any missile attack on North America, and worldwide
communications platforms for strategic command and control.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.13. Cuban Missile Crisis (1962):</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.13.1. In 1959, Fidel
Castro overthrew the dictator of Cuba, initially promising free elections, but
instead he instituted a socialist dictatorship. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans
fled their island, many coming to the United States. In late 1960, President
Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to plan an invasion of
Cuba using Cuban exiles as troops. President Eisenhower hoped that, in
conjunction with the invasion, the Cuban people would overthrow Castro and
install a pro-United States government. The President's second term ended
before the plan could be implemented. President John F. Kennedy ordered the
invasion to proceed. In mid-April 1961, the Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of
Pigs and suffered a crushing defeat.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="217" height="168" src="afh1_files/image035.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.13.2. Following the
failure of the United States-supported Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by Cuban
exiles in April 1961, the Soviet Union increased economic and military aid to
Cuba. In August 1962, the Soviets and Cubans started constructing intermediate-
and medium-range ballistic missile complexes on the island. Suspicious, the
United States intelligence community called for photographic investigation and
verification of the activity. In October, Strategic Air Command U-2 aircraft
deployed to McCoy Air Force Base, Florida, and began flying high-altitude
reconnaissance flights over Cuba. On 15 October, photographs obtained on
flights the previous day confirmed the construction of launch pads that, when
completed, could be used to employ nuclear-armed missiles with a range up to
5,000 miles. Eleven days later, RF101s and RB-66s began conducting low-level
reconnaissance flights, verifying data gathered by the U-2s and gathering
prestrike intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.13.3. In the event an
invasion of Cuba became necessary, Tactical Air Command deployed F-84, F-100,
F-105, RB-66, and KB-50 aircraft to numerous bases in Florida. Meanwhile,
Strategic Air Command prepared for general war by dispersing nuclear-capable B-47
aircraft to approximately 40 airfields in the United States and keeping
numerous B-52 heavy bombers in the air ready to strike.</span></p>

<p><span>1.13.4. Meanwhile,
President Kennedy and his advisors on the national security team debated the
most effective course of action. Many on the Joint Chiefs of Staff favored
invasion, but President Kennedy took the somewhat less drastic step of imposing
a naval blockade of the island, which was designed to prevent any more materiel
from reaching Cuba. Still technically an act of war, the blockade nevertheless
had the advantage of not turning the cold war into a hot one.</span></p>

<p><span>1.13.5. Confronted with
the photographic evidence of missiles, the Soviet Union initially responded
belligerently. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev accused the United States of
degenerate imperialism and declared that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic
would not observe the illegal blockade. In the ensuing days, Khrushchev
softened, and then hardened, his position and demands. Tensions increased on 27
October when Cuban air defenses shot down a U-2 piloted by Major Rudolf
Anderson.</span></p>

<p><span>1.13.6. The Joint Chiefs
of Staff recommended an immediate air strike against Cuba, but President
Kennedy decided to wait. The increasing tempo in the military, however,
continued unabated. While United States military preparations continued, the
United States agreed not to invade Cuba in exchange for removal of Soviet
missiles from the island. Secretly, the United States also agreed to remove
American missiles from Turkey. The Soviets turned their Cuban-bound ships
around, packed up the missiles in Cuba, and dismantled the launch pads. As the
work progressed, the Air Force started to deploy aircraft back to home bases
and lower the alert status.</span></p>

<p><span>1.13.7. The Cuban
Missile Crisis brought the United States and the Soviet Union dangerously close
to nuclear war; the world breathed a sigh of relief when it ended. The
strategic and tactical power of the United States Air Force, coupled with the
will and ability to use it, provided the synergy to deter nuclear war with the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republic and convince the Soviet leaders to remove
the nuclear weapons from Cuba.&nbsp;<b><i>Section 1E Vietnam, Desert Storm and
Operations (1992-2014)</i></b></span></p>

<p><b><span>1.14. Vietnam, 1961-1973:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.14.1. After eight
years, during which the Air Force worked to build America's strategic nuclear
forces, President Kennedy's administration faced national wars of liberation
backed by the Soviet Union. Responding to Communist efforts in Laos and South
Vietnam, President Kennedy in April 1961 ordered Operation FARMGATE; the covert
deployment of the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron (Jungle Jim) to train
the South Vietnamese Air Force. Flying North American T-28 Trojans, Douglas
A-26 Invaders, and Douglas A-1E Skyraiders, American pilots launched attack
missions under the umbrella of combat training. Following the August 1964 Gulf
of Tonkin incident, when North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked the USS&nbsp;<i>Maddox</i>,
President Lyndon B. Johnson lifted the shroud of secrecy and ordered an
orchestrated air attack as a show of force. By December 1964, North American
F-100 Super Sabres, McDonnell RF-101 Voodoos, and Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs,
with Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker support, conducted Operation BARRELL ROLL,
attacking Communist forces in Laos.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="178" height="141" src="afh1_files/image036.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="214" height="169" src="afh1_files/image037.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.14.2. Faced with a
deteriorating political and military situation in South Vietnam, President
Johnson ordered Operation ROLLING THUNDER; a sign of American support to South
Vietnam and a signal of United States resolve. Beginning on 2 March 1965,
Rolling Thunder was  a program of measured and limited air action against
selected military targets in North Vietnam remaining south of the 19th
Parallel.  Closely managed by the White House, Rolling Thunder sought to apply
incrementally announced military power to undermine the North Vietnamese will
to wage war. However, the United States underestimated the enemy's resiliency
and determination. Air Force leaders chafed at rules of engagement that negated
the speed, surprise, and flexibility of massed airpower. They believed periodic
bombing pauses intended to signal American intentions allowed the enemy to
recover. In 1965, North Vietnamese air defenses multiplied, including
Soviet-made SA-2 surface-to-air missiles. Hanoi established an advanced
radar-controlled air defense system that combined surface-to-air missiles,
antiaircraft artillery, and Sovietproduced MiG-17 and MiG-21 interceptors.
Consequently, United States losses mounted without any visible effect from the
air campaign. By the fall of 1968, Air Force tactical aircraft had flown
166,000 sorties over North Vietnam, and Navy attack aircraft added 144,500. In
the process, the enemy downed 526 Air Force aircraft: surface-to-air missiles
accounted for 54, MiGs destroyed 42, and antiaircraft artillery claimed the
remainder. Personnel losses were equally heavy. Of the 745 Air Force crew
members shot down over North Vietnam, 145 were rescued, 255 were confirmed
killed, 222 were captured, and 123 were classified missing in action. Air Force
leaders found these results intolerable for an air campaign with virtually
complete air superiority.</span></p>

<p><span>1.14.3. Complementing
operations over North Vietnam, the air war over South Vietnam demonstrated the
full spectrum of airpower. Air Force aircraft and helicopters provided close
air support, interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, tanker support, and
search-and-rescue capabilities. Air Force resources ranged from one-man Cessna
O-1 Bird Dogs, used by forward air controllers to mark enemy targets for
strikers, to mammoth B-52Ds modified to drop as many as 27 750pound bombs, and
84 500-pound bombs for Operation ARC LIGHT interdiction missions. Vintage World
War II aircraft, like AC-47 Puff the Magic Dragon gunships, joined
state-of-the-art platforms like the General Dynamics swingwing, advanced
terrain-following radar F-111 Aardvark.</span></p>

<p><span>1.14.4. The January 1968
siege of Khe Sanh displayed the potential of Air Force close air support. When
more than</span></p>

<p><span>20,000 North Vietnamese
troops, protected by hilly, covered terrain, surrounded 6,000 United States
Marines, General William Momyer applied massive firepower during Operation
NIAGARA. A flight of three B-52s hit the enemy every 90 minutes for most of the
77-day siege. To prevent the enemy from overrunning the base, American aircraft
dropped 100,000 tons of bombs, two-thirds of those from B-52s.</span></p>

<p><span>1.14.5. Following the
1968 bombing halt, President Richard M. Nixon initiated a phased withdrawal
from the frustrating conflict. From 536,000 United States troops in 1968,
American personnel numbered fewer than 100,000 by 1972. When the North
Vietnamese launched the Easter Offensive in Spring 1972, Nixon resolved to
achieve peace with honor. Reinforcing ground troops was politically impossible,
so Nixon employed Operation LINEBACKER to blunt the Communist attack.</span></p>

<p><span>1.14.6. Unlike Rolling
Thunder, military leaders were allowed to use appropriate strategy and tactics,
in part because the administration significantly reduced restrictions. With the
acquisition of precision-guided munitions, new television and laser-guided
smart bombs dramatically increased strike accuracy.</span></p>

<p><span>1.14.7. On 13 May 1972,
16 McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantoms hit the Than Hoa bridge with 24 smart bombs,
destroying a target that had eluded American Airmen for years. From April to
October 1972, Air Force and Navy aircraft dropped 155,548 tons of bombs on
North Vietnamese troops. The era's first war aces earned their marks during
Linebacker, as well. On 28 August 1972, Captain Steve Ritchie shot down his
fifth MiG- 21. Within weeks, two F-4 weapons systems officers joined the
fraternity of aces: Captain Charles De Bellevue with six kills and Captain
Jeffrey Feinstein with five. When North Vietnamese negotiators accepted
specific peace conditions, President Nixon terminated the air campaign.</span></p>

<p><span>1.14.8. In December
1972, North Vietnamese intransigence over the final peace agreement prompted
President Nixon to initiate Linebacker II, an intense 11-day air campaign to
pressure enemy compliance. From 18-29 December, American aircraft pounded
military and industrial targets in North Vietnam. For the first time, the White
House authorized B-52 strikes near Hanoi. In less than two weeks, 729 B-52
sorties dropped 15,000 tons of bombs and fighter-bombers added another 5,000
tons. Despite the loss of 26 aircraft, including 15 B-52s, airpower broke the
impasse. Peace talks resumed 8 January 1973, and a comprehensive ceasefire was
signed 23 January.</span></p>

<p><span>1.14.9. During Vietnam,
airpower demonstrated its versatility and wide ranging impact, as well as its
limitations. Despite an impressive military showing, the United States did not
win decisively in Vietnam. Although the Air Force flew more than five million
sorties and dropped six million tons of bombs, North Vietnamese forces
eventually conquered South Vietnam in April 1975. Airpower did not prevent the
collapse of the South Vietnamese government or the change in American political
climate.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Duane Hackney</span></b></p>



<p><span>1.14.10.
The Vietnam War saw a number of notable and heroic achievements by Air Force
enlisted members, including two winners of the Medal of Honor, who will be
discussed in detail in a later section of this chapter. While not a Medal of
Honor recipient, Duane Hackney became one of the most honored heroes of the
Vietnam War, the recipient of 28 decorations for valor in combat (more than 70
awards and decorations in all), and winner of the Cheney Award for 1967, an
honor presented for valor or self-sacrifice in a humanitarian effort. Hackney
enlisted in the Air Force a few days after graduation, volunteering for
pararescue training. An honor graduate in every phase of the tough, year-long
course, he had his choice of assignments. Airman Second Class Hackney turned
down assignments in Bermuda and England for Detachment 7, 38th Aerospace Rescue
and Recovery Squadron, at Da Nang. Hackney flew more than 200 combat missions
in three and a half years of Vietnam duty, all as a volunteer. He earned four
Distinguished Flying Crosses for specific acts of heroism and 18 Air Medals,
many for single acts of valor. He also received the Air Force Cross, the Silver
Star, the Airman's Medal, the Purple Heart, and several foreign decorations.
Hackney's most celebrated mission was on 6 February 1967. That morning he
descended from a HH-3E Jolly Green Giant to look for a downed pilot near Mu Gia
pass. The pilot had stopped his radio transmissions, a clue that enemy troops
were nearby. For two hours, Hackney searched for the man, dodging enemy
patrols, until the mission was called off because of weather. Late that
afternoon, the downed pilot came back on the air, and Hackney's crew headed for
the rescue area to get him out before dark. This time Hackney found his man,
badly injured but alive, got him onto the forest penetrator, and started up to
the chopper, drawing small-arms fire all the way. As the men were hauled
aboard, the helicopter took a direct hit from a 37-mm antiaircraft gun and
burst into flame. Wounded by shell fragments and suffering third-degree burns,
Hackney, knowing that the HH-3 was not going to make it, put his own parachute
on the rescued pilot and got him out of the doomed chopper. Groping through
dense smoke, he found an oil-soaked chute and slipped it on. Before he could
buckle the chute, a second 37-mm shell hit the HH-3, blowing him out the door.
He did not remember pulling the ripcord of the unbuckled chute before hitting
trees 250 feet below, then plunging 80 feet to a rock ledge in a crevasse. When
he regained consciousness, enemy troops were leaping across the crevasse a few
feet above him Once they were gone, Hackney popped his smoke and was picked up
by the backup chopper. There were no other survivors from the rescue
helicopter. For that mission, Hackney received the Air Force Cross. In 1973,
Hackney left the Air Force, one of the most decorated pararescuemen of the
Vietnam War. Four years later, missing the camaraderie of Air Force life, he
enlisted again, returning to duty as a pararescue instructor. In 1981, he
suffered a severe heart attack, the result of a rescue operation, and was
permanently grounded. Altogether, he served in the United States Air Force from
1965 to 1991, retiring as a Chief Master Sergeant.</span></p>



<p><span>1.14.11.
In December 1972, B-52 tail gunner Staff Sergeant Samuel Turner shot down an
enemy MiG, the first of only two confirmed shootdowns by enlisted Airmen during
the war both victories from gunners belonging to the 307<sup>th</sup> Strategic
Wing at U-Tapao, Thailand. Credit for the fifth overall MiG-21 kill during
Linebacker II also went to an enlisted Airman, Airman First Class Albert E.
Moore.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.14.12. Chief Master
Sergeant Wayne Fisk was directly involved in the famed Son Tay prisoner of war
camp raid and the rescue of the crew of the USS&nbsp;<i>Mayaquez.&nbsp;</i>When
the USS<i>&nbsp;Mayaquez</i>&nbsp;was highjacked by Cambodian Communist forces
in May 1975, Fisk was a member of the assault force that successfully recovered
the ship, the crew, and the entrapped United States Marines. For his actions,
Fisk was presented with his second Silver Star. Concluding the&nbsp;<i>Mayaquez</i>&nbsp;mission,
he was recognized as the last American serviceman to engage Communist forces in
ground combat in Southeast Asia. In 1979, he was the first Air Force enlisted
recipient of the United States Jaycees Ten Outstanding Young Men of America. In
1986, Fisk became the first director of the Air Force Enlisted Heritage Hall on
Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="87" height="166" src="afh1_files/image039.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Wayne Fisk</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>1.15. The Post-Vietnam Era and the end of the
Cold War:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.15.1. Rebuilding the
conventional Air Force after Vietnam began with personnel changes. The
Vietnam-era Air Force included many members who had entered its ranks in World
War II. President Nixon ended the draft in 1973 in favor of an all-volunteer
American military. The Air Force attracted recruits as best it could but
encountered problems with the racial friction and alcohol and drug abuse that
reflected America's social problems. Enough Vietnam career veterans remained,
however, to direct the new service and implement changes. One of the most
notable of those changes was more realistic- more dangerous- combat training.
In combat simulations, Air Force pilots flew as aggressors employing enemy
tactics. By 1975, training had evolved into Red Flag at the United States Air
Force Weapons and Tactics Center, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. Red Flag
aircrews flew both individual sorties and formations in realistic situations to
gain application experience before actual combat. Colonel Richard  Moody  Suter
is the founder of Red Flag. As a major, working in the Pentagon in 1975, he saw
his vision through to fruition. Red Flag revolutionized Air Force training.
According to senior leaders at the time, Colonel Suter's efforts resulted in a
program that made the United States Air Force the premier air arm of the world.</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.2. An innovative
genius, Suter flew more than 200 combat missions in Vietnam and was the first
F-15 Eagle squadron commander. In addition to Red Flag, he is credited with
founding the Air Force aggressor squadron, and the Einsiedlerhof Air Station,
Germany Warrior Preparation Center, used to train senior battle commanders in
the art of war. Suter was the driving force behind Checkmate, the Air Force
think tank for wartime scenarios. After his death in January 1996, the Warrior
Preparation Center Command Section Building and Red Flag Building, Nellis Air
Force Base, Nevada, were named in his honor.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="204" height="152" src="afh1_files/image040.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.15.3. Post-Vietnam
rebuilding included applying technology improvements. The battle for control of
the skies over North Vietnam emphasized the need for a highly maneuverable
dogfighting aircraft armed with missiles and cannon. The F-15 Eagle and F-16
Fighting Falcon filled this need. The danger posed by radar-guided antiaircraft
artillery and surface-to-air missiles in Vietnam drove the Air Force to develop
stealth technology: special paints, materials, and designs to reduce or
eliminate aircraft radar, thermal, and electronic signatures. Operational by
October 1980, the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter featured detection avoidance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.4. Other Vietnam
War technologies included precision-guided munitions and smart bombs. From
April 1972 to January 1973, the United States used more than 4,000 early smart
weapons to destroy bridges and enemy tanks. Laserguided bombs, electro-optically-guided
missiles, and other precision technologies changed Air Force doctrine from its
focus on strategic bombing to pinpoint bombing focused on destroying enemy s
industrial web chokepoints with economy of force and no collateral damage. To
overcome numerically superior Warsaw Pact forces, the Air Force worked with the
Army to update the air-land battle tactical doctrine published in Field Manual
100-5. The Air Force would make deep air attacks on an enemy army to isolate it
on the battlefield, conduct battlefield air interdiction to prevent enemy
reinforcements from reaching the front, disrupt the movement of secondary
forces to the front, and provide close air support to Army ground forces. The
Air Force procured the A-10 Thunderbolt II in the 1970s to support such
missions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.5. Operation RICE
BOWL, the April 1980 attempt to rescue American hostages from the United States
embassy in</span></p>

<p><span>Iran,
ended in disaster at the Desert One refueling site. Inquiries led to the
reorganization and revitalization of United States Special Operations Forces.
Crisis support missions during the 1980s allowed the Air Force to test new
ideas and technologies. During Operation URGENT FURY, October 1983, American
forces rescued American students and restored order to Grenada. The Air Force
primarily transported troops and cargo, but discovered problems with command,
control, planning, and intraservice &amp; interservice coordination during the
operation. In April 1986, President Reagan mobilized England- based F-111s to
strike Libya during Operation ELDORADO CANYON. The counterterrorism operation
exposed on-going target identification and intelligence difficulties,
punctuated by inaccurate bombing. Finally, Operation JUST CAUSE in 1989 tested
air operations; this time in Panama. The Air Force primarily airlifted troops
and supplies, but also debuted the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, with an
AC-130 Spectre gunship, intimidating Panamanian troops loyal to dictator Manuel
Noriega.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.15.6. President
Kennedy's flexible-response nuclear war doctrine of the early 1960s lacked the
technology to match its vision of adapting to meet various Cold War crises.
Advances in geodesy, cartography, missile and satellite guidance system
integrated circuits significantly improved missile accuracy. Technology
improvements resulted in better targeting systems and smaller, more effective
warheads. Because they were smaller and lighter, more warheads could be mounted
to intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine launched ballistic
missiles. In the early 1970s, the Department of Defense developed multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicles, allowing three or more warheads to
be mounted on each intercontinental ballistic missile and submarine launched
ballistic missiles. The Air Force arsenal peaked at 1,054 Titan and Minuteman
intercontinental ballistic missiles, but many carried three multiple
independently targetable reentry vehicles, as opposed to earlier models that
carried a single warhead. In spite of technological advances, planned targets
continued to support the doctrine of mutually assured destruction or the
capacity to eradicate an enemy's society, even after an attack on United States
forces.</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.7. Mutually assured
destruction doctrine was based on the theory that superpower strategic nuclear
forces could be sized and protected to survive a nuclear attack in order to
retaliate with sufficient force to destroy the other side. Such retaliatory
destruction was deterrent insurance because no rational leader would consider
starting a nuclear war knowing that the result would be nuclear
destruction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.8. For two decades
the Air Force developed more capable satellite systems, such as the Missile
Defense Alarm</span></p>

<p><span>System, which was the
first attempt at a space-based long-range missile attack detection and warning
system. Missile Defense Alarm System 7, launched 9 May 1963, validated the
concept of infrared sensing from a nearly circular 2,000mile orbit. The need
for accurate information on Soviet nuclear testing led to the development of a
space-based system that could specifically detect nuclear explosions. In
September 1959, Department of Defense directed the Advanced Research Projects
Agency to develop the Vela Hotel nuclear detection program; a low-cost,
automated nuclear detection satellite constellation. The first pair of Vela
satellites was launched from Cape Canaveral, 16 October 1963, and detected a
nuclear blast the next day. Extensive United States and Soviet spending for
weapons and related systems escalated into what appeared to be an unlimited
strategic arms race.</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.9. However, on 26
May 1972, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed
the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty, limiting each country to two Anti-Ballistic
Missile sites: one to protect the national capital and an intercontinental
ballistic missile complex. The treaty served to reinforce the notion of the
mutually assured destruction doctrine as a deterrent. The Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty, which was signed at the same time, limited the number of
nuclear weapons, with the objective of obtaining a verified freeze on the
numerical growth and destabilizing characteristics of each side's strategic
nuclear forces.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.10. Satellite
advances significantly enhanced weather and communications support. The Air
Force vision of weather satellites was realized with the development of a
dedicated military weather satellite system known initially as the Defense
Satellite Applications Program. Early Defense Satellite Applications Program
military weather satellites were relatively unsophisticated, weighing about 430
pounds. The Initial Defense Satellite Communications Program, launched 16 June
1966, was one of the earliest Air Force satellite communication systems.
Another benefit of early satellites was improved navigation. Although the Navy
produced the first working satellite navigation system (Transit), an early Air
Force navigation satellite program was designed to provide precise time and
navigation information in three dimensions. Later, a joint Air Force and Navy
program would result in what became known as the NAVSTAR Global Positioning
System.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="177" height="177" src="afh1_files/image041.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.15.11.
Increased defense spending during the early 1980s resulted in more mature space
and missile programs (most of which are still in service) to replace the
systems developed in the 1960s and 1970s. These included the Defense Support</span></p>

<p><span>Program,
the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, the Defense Satellite
Communications System, and the Global Positioning System. Concurrently, the Air
Force developed the ground-based infrastructure to support, augment, and
complement the space-based portions of the systems. Ground-based systems
included the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System; orbiting space object
surveillance using Baker-Nunn cameras; and the Air Force Satellite Control
Network. In addition, the Air Force developed launch support bases necessary to
get satellites into space   one at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the other at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The launch bases provided support not only
for Department of Defense sponsored systems but also for National Aeronautics
and Space Agency, other United States government agencies, and commercial
requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.12. In the late
1970s and early 1980s, the time had come to substantially reorganize the way
the service managed its space systems. Chief of Staff, Air Force General Lew
Allen appeared with Under Secretary of the Air Force Pete Aldridge, 21 June
1982 to announce the formation of Space Command, with activation slated for 1
September 1982. Air Force Space Command's responsibilities grew quickly over
the ensuing decade as it absorbed programs from Aerospace Defense Command, Air
Force Systems Command, and Strategic Air Command. Eventually command missions
included missile warning, space surveillance, satellite control, space defense,
space support to operational forces, and launch operations. The organizational
changes that led to the establishment of Space Command reflected a growth in
the use of space systems in support of worldwide joint operations.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.13. In a 23 March
1983 address, President Ronald Reagan proposed replacing the doctrine of
mutually assured destruction with one of assured survival, through
implementation of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Strategic Defense Initiative
would include a combination of defensive systems such as space-based lasers,
particle beams, railguns, and fast ground-launched missiles, among others, to
intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles in the earth's outer atmosphere
and ballistic path in space. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet
Union eliminated the justification for the level of research and development
associated with the project, although research continued at a much-lower level
under the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.</span><span> </span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="166" height="253" src="afh1_files/image042.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><sub><span>Berlin Wall symbol of the Cold War</span></sub></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.15.14. Beginning in
March 1985, Soviet Communist Party General-Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev
initiated major changes in Soviet-American relations. The Intermediate Range
Nuclear Forces Treaty, in December 1987, eliminated medium-range nuclear
missiles, including United States Air Force ground-launched cruise missiles.
Gorbachev's announcement in May 1988 that the Soviet Union, after nine years
of&nbsp;</span><b><sub><span>&nbsp;</span></sub></b><span>inconclusive combat, would withdraw from the war
in Afghanistan resulted in reduced Cold War tension, but it was only a hint of
the rapid changes ahead. Relatively free and open Russian national elections in
March 1989, followed by a coal miner strike in July, shook the foundations of
Communist rule. East Germany opened the Berlin Wall in November which led to
German reunification in October 1990. The August 1991 coup against Gorbachev,
led by Boris Yeltsin, resulted in the dissolution of the Soviet Union, replaced
25 December 1991 by the Commonwealth of Independent States.</span></p>

<p><span>1.15.15. American
nuclear strategy changed significantly in response to these changes. Under the
Strategic Arms</span></p>

<p><span>Reduction Treaty I,
signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in July 1991, the Air Force
would reduce arms to 6,000 total warheads on deployed intercontinental
ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers.
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II, signed in January 1993, would reduce total
deployed warheads up to a range of 3,500 nautical miles. The resulting force
structure (determined during the Nuclear Posture Review process overseen by
then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin), would ultimately lead to the deployment
of 500 single-warhead Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, 66
B-52H, and 20 B-2 heavy bombers. Ninety-four B-1 heavy bombers would be
reoriented to a conventional role by 2003, and all Peacekeeper intercontinental
ballistic missiles would be removed from active inventory and associated silo
launchers eliminated. The Air Force, by presidential direction in September
1991, notified Strategic Air Command to remove heavy bombers from alert status.
Strategic Air Command was subsequently inactivated in June 1992. United States
Strategic Command, a unified combatant command, replaced Strategic Air Command
and assumed control of all remaining Air Force and Navy strategic nuclear
forces.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.16. Desert Storm (The Air Campaign against
Iraq, 1990-1991):&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.16.1. On 2 August
1990, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein ordered 100,000 troops to invade oil-rich
Kuwait, claiming</span></p>

<p><span>Kuwait as Iraq's 19th
province. International condemnation followed, and on 6 August the United
Nations authorized an economic embargo. The same day, President George H. W.
Bush announced Operation DESERT SHIELD, the deployment of United States air and
ground units to defend Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf states. Within 18 hours of
the order, Air Force Military Airlift Command C-141 and C-5 transports
delivered the Army 82d Airborne Division and</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>elements of the Air
Force 1st Tactical Fighter Wing (whose 48 F-15Cs flew direct).</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="210" height="153" src="afh1_files/image043.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.16.2.
Operation DESERT SHIELD eclipsed the Berlin Airlift as the greatest air
deployment in history. Military Airlift Command cargo planes delivered
defensive forces 7 August - 8 November 1990, brought counteroffensive material
9 November - January 1991. The air bridge spanned more than 7,000 miles and
included 20,500 strategic airlift missions. Desert Shield validated the C-5A
Galaxy and C-141 Starlifter large capacity heavy lifters, which carried 534,000
passengers and 542,000 tons of cargo during the Gulf War.</span></p>

<p><span>1.16.3. The Gulf War represents the first, extensive, broad-based
employment of space support capabilities. Coalition forces employed more than
60 military satellites, as well as commercial and civil sector systems during
the conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>Defense Meteorological
Satellite Program provided dedicated meteorological support in theater, which
helped provide safe, highly effective combat power planning and application in
a harsh environment characterized by sandstorms and oil fires. Satellite-based
systems delivered more than 90 percent of all communications to and from the
theater due to the sheer volume and the lack of ground-based infrastructure. At
the height of the conflict, 700,000 phone calls and 152,000 messages per day
flowed over satellite links.</span></p>

<p><span>1.16.4. At 0100, 17
January 1991, three Air Force Special Operations MH-53J Pave Low helicopters
led nine Army Apaches on the first strike mission of Operation DESERT STORM.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="248" height="171" src="afh1_files/image044.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.16.5. Within hours,
the world watched live television coverage of Iraqi skies filled with
antiaircraft artillery fire. F-117A Nighthawks struck heavily defended targets
with unprecedented precision. Under the command of Lieutenant General Charles
A. Horner, United States Central Command Air Forces, 2,700 aircraft from 14
countries and services implemented the master attack plan. The coalition effort
overwhelmed the Iraqi air defense system with speed, surprise, precision, and
mass. A flight of seven B-52Gs flew nonstop from Barksdale Air Force Base
Louisiana to strike Iraqi power stations and communications facilities with Air
Launched Cruise Missiles. At 35 hours round-trip, the 14,000-mile raid was the
longest combat mission up to that time and proof of America's global reach.</span></p>

<p><span>1.16.6. The first week
of Desert Storm focused on achieving air supremacy and destroying the enemy s
command and control system. Captain Jon K.  JB  Kelk, flying an F-15C, scored
the first air-to-air kill, downing an Iraqi MiG-29. All total, coalition aircraft
shot down 41 Iraqi aircraft, with Captain Thomas N.  Vegas' Dietz and First
Lieutenant Robert W.  Gigs' Hehemann each credited with three kills.
Additionally, Allied air forces destroyed 375 enemy aircraft and 594 hardened
bunkers. Faced with coalition air dominance, 148 Iraqi aircraft fled to
neighboring Iran.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.16.7. The air campaign
then prepared the battlefield by isolating Iraqi ground units, interdicting
supplies, and reducing enemy combat power. A-10 Thunderbolt II  Warthogs' and
F-15Es introduced a new term -tank plinking - as they destroyed the enemy s
armored forces. F-111F  Aardvarks' dropped 4,600 of the 8,000 precision-guided
munitions.&nbsp; EF-111A electronic warfare aircraft provided tactical
jamming, while combined RC- 135 Rivet Joint, E-8 Joint Surveillance Target
Attack Radar System (Joint STARS), and E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System
aircraft provided intelligence and command and control. Perhaps the most
spectacular element: B-52s shattered Iraqi Army morale with massive bomb drops.
When one Iraqi commander asserted that he surrendered because of B-52 strikes,
his interrogator pointed out that his position had never been attacked by the
B-52.  That is true, but I saw one that had been attacked,  said the
Iraqi.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.16.8. Not all aspects
of the air campaign were successful. Early in the campaign, Iraq launched
modified Soviet Scud missiles against Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Persian
Gulf states. On 18 January 1991, United States Air Force A-10s,&nbsp;
F-16s, and F-15Es with Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night
pods commenced the Great Scud Hunt. Despite 2,767 sorties (22 percent of the
strategic air phase), air patrols did not destroy a significant number of the
missiles. Iraqi camouflage, decoys, and employment tactics frustrated the
effort. The enemy launched 88 Scuds, including one that struck a United States
Army Reserve unit at Dhahran, killing 28 soldiers and wounding 98. The antiScud
effort did limit Scud launches after the first 2 weeks of fighting and reduced the
political impact of the weapon.</span></p>

<p><span>1.16.9. The Desert Storm
air campaign demonstrated airpower's impact on a conventional battlefield. Air
Force space assets provided precision positioning and navigation to joint and
coalition forces with the combat debut of the Global Positioning System. Space
forces also provided the coalition and allies with advanced Iraqi Scud launch
warnings. Defense Support Program gave timely warning of the launch of Iraqi
Scud missiles to United States forces in theater and allowed Patriot batteries
in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait sufficient time to engage the incoming
Iraqi intermediate range ballistic missiles. Space force capabilities
influenced Israel to remain neutral, thereby preserving the integrity of the
allied coalition. Over the course of the 44-day air campaign, the coalition
flew 118,661 sorties, of which the Air Force flew 60 percent. The 1991 Persian
Gulf War brought military space operations to the joint community. The Gulf War
was the first conflict to highlight the force enhancement capabilities of
space-based communications, intelligence, navigation, missile warning, and
weather satellites. Desert Storm also demonstrated the impact of
precision-guided munitions on modern war. Although precision-guided munitions accounted
for only eight percent of the 88,500 tons of bombs dropped, they were
responsible for 80 percent of the destroyed targets. While coalition ground
forces delivered General Schwarzkopf's famous Hail Mary outflanking maneuver
that applied the final blow to the Iraqi military forces, airpower set the
stage for victory. As the Gulf War Air Power Survey stated: It was not the
number of Iraqi tanks or artillery pieces destroyed, or the number of Iraqi
soldiers killed that mattered. It was the effectiveness of the air campaign in
breaking apart the organizational structure and cohesion of enemy military
forces and in reaching the mind of the Iraqi soldier that counted.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span>1.17. Operations PROVIDE RELIEF, IMPRESSIVE
LIFT, and RESTORE HOPE Somalia (1992-1994):</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.17.1. Civil unrest in
the wake of a two-year civil war contributed to a famine in Somalia that killed
up to 350,000 people in 1992. As many as 800,000 refugees fled the stricken
country. The United Nations-led relief effort began in July 1992. To relieve the
suffering of refugees near the Kenya-Somalia border and then Somalia itself,
the United States initiated Operation PROVIDE RELIEF in August 1992. By
December, the United States airlifted 38 million pounds of food into the
region, sometimes under the hail of small arms fire. Continued civil war and
clan fighting within Somalia, however, prevented much of the relief supplies
from getting into the hands of those who most desperately needed them.</span></p>

<p><span>1.17.2.
First, the United Nations, then the United States, attempted to alleviate the
problem. In September, the United States initiated Operation IMPRESSIVE LIFT to
airlift hundreds of Pakistani soldiers under the United Nations banner to
Somalia. Despite the increased security from the United Nations forces, the problems
continued. On 4 December, President George Bush authorized Operation RESTORE
HOPE to establish order in the country so that food could reach those in need.
Marines landed and assumed control of the airport, allowing flights in and out
of Mogadishu, Somalia, to resume. C-5 Galaxies, C-141 Starlifters, C-130
Hercules, and even KC-10 tankers rushed supplies into the country. Further, the
Operation RESTORE HOPE airlift brought 32,000 United States troops into
Somalia. In March 1993, the United Nations once again assumed control of the
mission, and Operation RESTORE HOPE officially ended 4 May 1993. Fewer than
5,000 of the 25,000 United States troops originally deployed remained in
Somalia. Unfortunately, factional fighting within the country caused the relief
effort to unravel yet again. On 3 October 1993, United States special forces
troops, in an effort to capture members of one clan, lost 18 personnel and
suffered 84 wounded.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.17.3. In the late
afternoon of 3 October 1993, Technical Sergeant Timothy A. Wilkinson, a
pararescueman with the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, responded with his crew
to the downing of a United States UH-60 helicopter in the streets of Mogadishu,
Somalia. Wilkinson repeatedly exposed himself to intense enemy small arms fire while
extracting the wounded and dead crewmembers from the crashed helicopter.
Despite his own wounds, he provided life-saving medical treatment to the
wounded crewmembers. With the helicopter crew taken care of, he turned to aid
the casualties of a ranger security element engaged in an intense firefight
across an open four-way intersection from his position where he began immediate
medical treatment. His decisive actions, personal courage, and bravery under
heavy enemy fire were integral to the success of all casualty treatment and
evacuation efforts conducted in the intense 18-hour combat engagement.
Wilkinson was awarded the Air Force Cross for his actions.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="204" height="166" src="afh1_files/image045.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>MSgt. Timothy A.
Wilkinson</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.17.4. The losses
sustained on 3 and 4 October prompted Operation RESTORE HOPE II, the airlifting
of 1,700 United States troops and 3,100 tons of cargo into Mogadishu between 5
and 13 October 1993. The troops and equipment were tasked with only stabilizing
the situation: President Clinton refused to commit the United States to  nation
building  and promised to remove United States forces by March 1994. Operation
RESTORE HOPE II officially ended 25 March 1994 when the last C-5 carrying
United States troops departed Mogadishu. While Operation RESTORE HOPE II
allowed United States forces to get out of the country without further
casualties, anarchy ruled in Somalia, and the threat of famine remained.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.18. Operation ALLIED FORCE:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.18.1. The post-Cold
War breakup of Yugoslavia proved to be NATO's greatest challenge in the 1990s.
Militant Serbian nationalism and a policy of ethnic cleansing, promoted by
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic, created a crisis in Kosovo in 1999.
Meanwhile, Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army fanned the flames
of violence. When diplomacy failed, NATO worried about the possibility of a
genocidal civil war and destabilization throughout the Balkans. As NATO debated
intervention, President Milosevic unleashed a ruthless offensive designed to
crush the Kosovo Liberation Army and drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo.
Faced with a massive humanitarian crisis, NATO turned to airpower.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.18.2. After Desert
Storm in early 1992, Chief of Staff, Air Force General Merrill McPeak,
introduced a revamped Air Force mission: Defend the United States through
control and exploitation of air and space. Resultant organizational changes
permitted the Air Force to attain an unprecedented level of integration between
air and space capabilities by the time the Air War over Serbia commenced in
1999. During Air War over Serbia, Air Force Space Command deployed nearly 150
space professionals to nine locations in theater. During the conflict,
multisource Tactical System/Combat Track I modifications to five B-52s and two
B-1s allowed near real-time information to flow to the cockpits. The
spaceenabled information included threats, target updates, imagery, and secure
communications with the wing operations center. Global Positioning System
satellites provided terminal guidance data for Joint Direct Attack Munitions, Conventional
Air Launched Cruise Missiles, and Tomahawk Land Attack Missile deliveries. This
conflict was the first operational employment of Joint Direct Attack Munitions,
demonstrating precision adverse weather delivery of multiple weapons against
multiple aim points on a single pass.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.18.3. Optimistic
policymakers looked to NATO's successful two-week Operation DELIBERATE FORCE in
1995 that brought relative peace to Bosnia. On 24 March 1999, President Bill
Clinton commenced Operation ALLIED FORCE, announcing three objectives:
demonstrate NATO's opposition to aggression; deter Milosevic from escalating
attacks on civilians; and damage Serbia's capability to wage war against
Kosovo. Milosevic and Serbian forces presented United States and NATO forces
with an opponent with a capacity for skilled propaganda and utter ruthlessness.
The ensuing 78day battle was directed against both the Serbian military and
Milosevic's propaganda efforts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.18.4. From 24 March to
9 June 1999, NATO air forces walked a political tightrope. In over 38,000
sorties, 13 of NATO's 19 nations attempted to pressure Milosevic, destroy
Serbian fielded forces engaged in Kosovo, and maintain popular support for
intervention. Initially, 214 strike aircraft followed a limited air campaign
against approximately 50 targets.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="216" height="147" src="afh1_files/image046.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.18.5. The B-2 Spirit
stealth bomber flew its first combat missions from Whiteman Air Force Base,
Missouri, delivering 650 Joint Direct Attack Munitions in 49 30-hour sorties.
On 27 March 1999, Serb air defenses shot down an Air Force F-117, but Combat
Search and Rescue personnel recovered the pilot. After weeks of caution and
frustration, NATO expanded the scale of the air campaign: 563 United States Air
Force aircraft and 13,850 American Airmen deployed to 24 locations.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.18.6. By June 1999,
NATO airpower accomplished its objectives, although complex political
constraints, abysmal flying weather, and a Serbianmanufactured refugee crisis
hampered progress. Despite a concerted effort to avoid civilian casualties, at
least 20 major incidents occurred, including the 7 May 1999 accidental bombing
of the Chinese embassy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.18.7. The 1999 air
campaign against Serbia reinforced historical lessons on employing air and
space power. Despite limitations, air and space forces proved precise,
effective, and rapid. In many ways, a limited air campaign represented the only
means available to coerce an implacable foe. Assessments of Operation ALLIED
FORCE concluded that air and ground commanders must agree on the enemy s
centers of gravity, and micromanaging the targeting process limits military
effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.19. Operations NOBLE EAGLE, ENDURING FREEDOM,
and IRAQI FREEDOM (Global War on Terrorism):&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.19.1. On 11 September
2001, 19 Islamic extremist Al Qaeda terrorists highjacked four airliners and
flew them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a remote field in
Pennsylvania, killing about 3,000 people. In response, President George W. Bush
declared a global war on terrorism. Operation NOBLE EAGLE immediately focused
on protecting the United States homeland from both internal and external air
attacks of the nature used on September 11. United States Air Force fighter,
tanker, and surveillance air assets provided 24-hour intercept response
coverage for virtually the entire United States in the form of ground alert and
airborne combat air patrols over designated locations.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.19.2. Operation
ENDURING FREEDOM focused on forming and acting with an international coalition,
which included forces from the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Czech
Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Jordan, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and other nations to
remove Afghanistan's Taliban government. The Taliban sponsored Al Qaeda
terrorism and provided a safe haven for Osama bin Laden, its leader.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="256" height="204" src="afh1_files/image047.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.19.3.
On 7 October 2001, 15 Air Force bombers, 25 Navy carrierstrike aircraft, and 50
United States and British sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles launched the
first wave of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM military operations. In the opening
days of the campaign, joint airpower destroyed Taliban air defenses, command
centers, and other fixed targets, and protected humanitarian relief missions to
the Afghan people. In contrast to Desert Storm and Allied Force, Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces presented few fixed targets suitable for air attack. Instead, Air
Force B-52 bombers carrying Global Positioning System-guided Joint Direct
Attack Munitions flew to engagement zones where ground-based forces directed
attacks. Global Positioning System-guided munitions were employed with great
accuracy, enabling air planners to reduce the number of air sorties required to
destroy a particular objective. Combat operations in Afghanistan began with
small groups of elite American military forces deployed to support anti-Taliban
Afghani fighters. A number of the deployed troops carried 2.75-pound Precision
Lightweight Global Positioning System Receivers and satellite-based
communications devices. Air Force combat controllers were among the 300 or so
Army, Navy, and Air Force special operations personnel augmenting the Afghan
Northern Alliance. On 13 November 2001, the Afghanistan capital, Kabul, fell to
coalition forces.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.19.4. One relatively
small but quite significant operation took place on 4 March 2002. The Pentagon
called it Operation ANACONDA and the press referred to it as the battle at
Shah-I-Kot Mountain, but the men who fought there called it the battle of
Robert's Ridge. In the early morning hours, on a mountaintop called Takur Ghar
in southeastern Afghanistan, al Qaeda soldiers fired on an MH-47E helicopter,
causing a Navy SEAL to fall to the ground, and a chain of events ensued
culminating in one of the most intense small-unit firefights of the war against
terrorism, the death of all the al Qaeda terrorists defending the mountaintop,
and the death of seven United States servicemen. Despite these losses, the
United States forces involved in this fight distinguished themselves by
conspicuous bravery. Their countless acts of heroism demonstrated the best of
America's Special Operations Forces as Air Force, Army, and Navy special
operators fought side by side to save one of their own and each other, and in
the process secured the mountaintop and inflicted serious loss on al Qaeda.</span><sub></sub></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.19.5. On 10 January
2003, Secretary of the Air Force posthumously awarded the Air Force Cross to
Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman. It was only the third time since the end of
the Vietnam conflict that an enlisted Airman received the Air Force Cross and
the second time that it went to one of the enlisted Airman who died in what
became a 17-hour ordeal on top of Takur Ghar mountain in Afghanistan. Chapman s
helicopter came under enemy fire, causing a Navy SEAL to fall out of a MH-47
helicopter during an insertion under fire. The helicopter landed 4.5 miles away
from where the SEAL was killed. Once on the ground, Chapman provided directions
to another helicopter to pick them up. After being rescued, Chapman and the
team volunteered to rescue their mission team member from the enemy stronghold.
After landing, Chapman killed two enemy soldiers and, without regard for his
own life, kept advancing toward a dug-in machinegun nest. The team came under</span></p>

<p><span>fire from three
directions. Chapman exchanged fire from minimum personal cover and succumbed to
multiple wounds. His engagement and destruction of the first enemy position and
advancement to the second enabled his team to move to cover and break enemy
contact. He is credited with saving the lives of the entire rescue team.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="142" height="205" src="afh1_files/image048.png" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Tech. Sgt. John A.
Chapman</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.19.6. Afghanistan s
rugged terrain, complex political relationships, and distance from operating
bases challenged coalition forces. (Navy aircraft flew 700 miles one way from
carriers, and Air Force bombers ventured 2,500 miles one way from Diego
Garcia.) Air Force KC- 135 tankers, C-17 and C-130 airlifters, Red Horse civil
engineer teams, spacebased Global Positioning System and intelligence-gathering
satellites, and other support functions proved to be unsung heroes of the
campaign. Their effectiveness reduced combat troop casualties. In the first 18
months, the Air Force flew more than 85,000 sorties (75 percent of the total
effort), dropped 30,750 munitions, delivered 487,000 tons of cargo, and
provided 3,025 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Even
after the defeat of the Taliban, operations in Afghanistan remained hazardous,
as United States and coalition forces there faced extended counterinsurgency
operations.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img width="189" height="174" src="afh1_files/image049.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.19.7 On 19 March 2003
a coalition of American and allied forces entered Iraq to end the regime of
Saddam Hussein and to free the Iraqi people, kicking off Operation IRAQI
FREEDOM. Much like the Gulf War, Operation IRAQI FREEDOM came as no surprise to
anyone besides Saddam Hussein. On 17 March 2003, President George W. Bush
announced a 48hour ultimatum for Saddam and his sons to leave Iraq or face
conflict. Saddam rejected President Bush's ultimatum to flee, and on 20 March a
salvo of missiles and laser-guided bombs hit targets where coalition forces
believed Saddam and his sons and other leaders gathered. Thus the war began.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.19.8. More than
300,000 troops were deployed to the Gulf region to form a multinational
coalition. Combat operations took longer than the 24-hour war of Operation
DESERT STORM. Operation IRAQI FREEDOM officially began on 20 March 2003, and
the primary combat phase ended on 1 May 2003. The Pentagon unleashed air
strikes so devastating they would leave Saddam's soldiers unable or unwilling
to fight. Between 300 and 400 cruise missiles were fired at targets, more than
the number launched during the entire first Gulf War. On the second day, the
plan called for launching another 300 to 400 missiles. The battle plan was
based on a concept developed at the National Defense University. Called  Shock
and Awe,  it focused on the psychological destruction of the enemy's will to
fight rather than the physical destruction of the opposing military force. The
concept relies on a large number of precision-guided weapons hitting the enemy
simultaneously, much like a nuclear weapon strike that takes minutes instead of
days or weeks to work.</span></p>

<p><span>1.19.9. Heavy sand
storms slowed the coalition advance, but soldiers reached within 50 miles of
Baghdad by 24 March. Missile attacks hit military facilities in Baghdad on 30
March, and by 2 April, the Baghdad and Medina divisions of Iraq's Republican
Guard were defeated. United States soldiers seized bridges over the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers and then advanced within 25 miles of Baghdad. The next day,
United States Army units along with Air Force special tactics combat
controllers, pararescuemen, and combat weathermen attacked Saddam International
Airport, 10 miles southwest of the capital. Two days later American-armored
vehicles drove through Baghdad after smashing through Republican Guard units.
On 7 April, United States tanks rumbled through downtown Baghdad and a B 1B
bomber attack hit buildings thought to hold Saddam and other leaders.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.19.10. On 8 April
2003, Staff Sergeant Scott Sather, a combat controller, became the first Airman
killed in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. The 29-year-old Michigan native earned seven
medals, including the bronze star, during his Air Force career. The citation
accompanying Sather's Bronze Star Medal with Valor reads,  He led this
reconnaissance task force on combat operations into Iraq on the first day of
the ground war, breeching enemy fortifications during the Iraqi border
crossing. During the next several days Sergeant Sather covered countless miles
conducting specialized reconnaissance in the Southwestern Iraqi desert
supporting classified missions. With only minimal sleep he assumed a leadership
role in the reconnaissance of an enemy airfield opening up the first of five
airheads used by a joint task force to conduct critical resupply of fielded
troops, and provide attack helicopter rearming facilities enabling deep
battlefield offensive operations. Sergeant Sather was then employed to an area
of heavy enemy concentration tasked to provide critical reconnaissance and
intelligence on enemy movement supporting direct action missions against enemy
forces. Exposed to direct enemy fire on numerous occasions he continued to
provide vital information to higher headquarters in direct support of ongoing
combat operations. His magnificent skills in the control of close air support
aircraft and keen leadership under great pressure were instrumental in the
overwhelming success of these dangerous missions. Sergeant Sather's phenomenal
leadership and bravery on the battlefield throughout his deployment were
instrumental in the resounding successes of numerous combat missions performing
a significant role in the success of the war and complete overthrow of the
Iraqi regime. </span></p>

<p><span>1.19.11. The withdrawal
of American military forces from Iraq had been a contentious issue within the
United States since the beginning of the Iraq War. As the war progressed from
its initial 2003 invasion phase to a multi-year occupation, United States
public opinion turned in favor of troop withdrawal. In late April 2007, the
United States Congress passed a supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a
deadline, but President Bush vetoed this bill soon afterwards. All United
States Forces were mandated to withdraw from Iraqi territory by 31 December
2011 under the terms of a bilateral agreement signed in 2008 by President
Bush.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><sup><span>SSgt. Scott D. Sather</span></sup></b></p>

<p><span>1.19.12. As the deadline
for withdrawal drew nearer, the mission of United States forces in Iraq
continued to move away from combat, and 1 September 2010 marked the transition
from Operation IRAQI FREEDOM to Operation NEW DAWN, signifying a formal end to
United States military combat operations. The transition to a supporting role
and stability operations was made possible by increased capability of Iraqi
Security Forces and their improved ability to combat terrorists and provide
security for the Iraqi people. As part of Operation NEW DAWN, United States
Forces had three primary missions: advising, assisting, and training the Iraqi
security forces; conducting partnered counterterrorism operations; and
providing support to provincial reconstruction teams and civilian partners as
they help build Iraq's civil capacity. The United States troop withdrawal from
Iraq was completed on 18 December 2011, early Sunday morning.</span></p>

<p><span>1.19.13. On 20 March
2011 a collection of aircraft launched in support of Operation ODYSSEY DAWN to
enforce United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, centered on protecting
Libyan citizens from further harm from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
Following the initial launch of Tomahawk missiles, three United States aircraft
led strikes on a variety of strategic targets over Libya. United States fighter
aircraft created airspace where no enemy forces could advance on Libyan
opposition troops.</span></p>

<p><span>1.19.14. As already
stated, the war in Afghanistan had begun in 2001, with the stated goal of dismantling
the al-Qaeda terrorist organization and ending its use of Afghanistan as a
base. The United States also said that it would remove the Taliban regime from
power and create a viable democratic state. More than a decade into the war,
NATO forces continued to battle a widespread Taliban insurgency, and the war
expanded into the tribal area of neighboring Pakistan. On 21 May 2012 the
leaders of the NATO-member countries signed off on President Barack Obama's
exit strategy from Afghanistan that called for an end to combat operations in
2013 and the withdrawal of the United States-led international military force
by the end of 2014.</span></p>

<p><span>1.19.15. On 9 June 2012
French President Francois Hollande announced his plan to withdraw combat forces
by year's end. In December of that year,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/15/world/asia/afghanistan-france-troops/"><span>France
pulled its last troops engaged directly in combat out of Afghanistan.</span></a><span>&nbsp;The remaining French troops, about 1,500,
remained for approximately six months removing equipment and helping to train
Afghan forces. Also on 2 September 2012 United States Special Operations Forces
temporarily suspended training of some 1,000 Afghan local police recruits while
they double-checked the background of the current police force, following a
rise in insider attacks against NATO troops by Afghan forces. On September 20,
2012<b>&nbsp;</b>the surge of United States forces in Afghanistan ended and the
last several hundred surge troops left the country. On 18 June 2013<b>&nbsp;</b>Afghan
National Security Forces formally took over combat operations.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?mthd=index&amp;crtr.page=1&amp;nid=824179"><span>Canada's

<p><span>1.19.16. For most United
States' and NATO forces, the war in Afghanistan was over by the end of 2014. At
NATO's International Security Assistance Force headquarters in Kabul, a ceremony
marked the end of International Security Assistance Force's mission and the
transition to the NATO-led Resolute Support. The new NATO presence would be
more than 12,500 troops to focus on Afghan security forces stability, and
United States personnel would number almost 11,000, including approximately
2,500 Airmen, in January 2015. The United States Operation ENDURING FREEDOM
would be replaced by Operation FREEDOM's SENTINEL, the name of the United
States portion of NATO's Resolute Support. Airmen would continue to work at
standing up the Afghan Air Force, and their mission could continue until the
Afghan Air Force becomes fully independent.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.19.17. In the latter
part of 2014, a new and ominous threat emerged that resulted in United States
Airmen again involved in operations in the skies over Iraq. The enemy, calling
themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, was an extremist Sunni
jihadist organization. Aided by a number of worldwide recruits and
sympathizers, Islamic State of Iraq and Levant gained control of territory in
Syria and northern Iraq (including the cities of Mosul and Fallujah) exceeding
the size of Great Britain, leaving savage atrocities in their wake, including
mass murders and ruthless executions of innocent civilians. Their brutality
resulted in nearly universal condemnation even Al Qaeda repudiated them and
President Obama authorized United States forces, in cooperation with partner
nations, to conduct carefully targeted air strikes over Syria and Iraq,
beginning in August, with the aim of degrading and defeating Islamic State of
Iraq and Levant. This operation, under the name of INHERENT RESOLVE, was still
ongoing at the end of 2014.</span></p>

<p><b><span>1.20. Historical Perspective Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>1.20.1.
From Kitty Hawk to Afghanistan, the record of air and space power emphasizes
powerful themes. The interplay of doctrine, technology, tactics, and strategy
must be sustained by training, logistics, supply, and support infrastructure.
Although history may not provide hard and fast lessons, it offers inspiration,
insight, and examples to spur your thinking. Today's Airmen draw from a proud
heritage of sacrifice, valor, and success. Just as our predecessors triumphed
over the challenges at St. Mihiel, Schweinfurt, and MiG Alley, you will face
new challenges with courage, skill, innovation, and perseverance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.20.2. From the skies
over the Rio Grande to those over Iraq and Afghanistan nearly 100 years later,
air power has evolved from an ineffective oddity to the dominant form of
military might in the world. Its applications and effectiveness have increased
with each succeeding conflict; in World War I air power played a minor role, in
Kosovo it played the only role. In addition to their air combat role, airmen
have bravely and successfully carried out a large number of humanitarian
missions, demonstrating the ability to save lives and alleviate suffering in
the face of both natural and manmade disasters. This chapter has looked at the
development of air power through the nation's many conflicts and contingencies,
spotlighting just a few of the many contributions of enlisted personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.1.&nbsp;<b>Orville
and Wilbur Wright.&nbsp;</b>The Wright brothers, bicycle manufacturers from
Dayton, Ohio, achieved the first powered, sustained, controlled airplane flight
in 1903, heralding the age of heavier-than-air aviation. Wilbur was born 16
April 1867, near Millville, Indiana, and Orville was
born&nbsp; 19 August 1871, in Dayton, Ohio. They became
interested in mechanical flight after reading about Otto Lilienthal s
successful glider experiments in Germany during the 1890s. In contrast to other
experimenters, the Wrights concentrated their efforts on a threedimensional
system of control, using an elevator and twisting the wings (called warping) in
combination with a vertical rudder. A series of biplane gliders in 1902 led to
a development of a perfectly controllable glider capable of generating
sufficient lift. Subsequently, the brothers designed and built a relatively
lightweight gasoline engine and revolutionary, highly efficient propellers for
the 1903 flyer. Using that aircraft, they successfully flew four manned
missions 17 December 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 1904 and 1905, the
Wright brothers conducted experiments at Huffman Prairie, near Dayton, and
introduced a new improved aircraft each year. The 1905 Wright flyer is
generally recognized as the first practical airplane. It could turn, bank, fly
figure eights, and remain aloft for over 30 minutes. It was not until 1907 that
the Signal Corps established an Aviation Section and issued a bid for a
military airplane. Tests of the Wright military machine began at Fort Myer,
Virginia, in 1908. A crash 17 September 1908, however, seriously injured
Orville, killed passenger Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge, and temporarily
interrupted testing. A new machine accepted in the fall of 1909 was the United
States Army's first airplane: Signal Corps No. 1. Subsequently the Wright
brothers trained several United States Army pilots, including Henry H.  Hap 
Arnold, future commander of the United States Army Air Forces during World War
II. The Wright Aircraft Company sold the Army several airplanes. The Wrights,
however, remained wedded to the wing warping system of control and their
airplanes became increasingly inferior and uncompetitive, while those of rivals
like Glenn Curtiss improved rapidly in performance. Wilbur died of typhoid
fever 30 May 1912, and Orville later sold the Wright Company and assumed a less
active role in aviation. He remained, however, the  father  of flying and a
highly honored individual until his death 30 January 1948.</span></p>



<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="158" height="200" src="afh1_files/image052.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.2.&nbsp;<b>Colonel William  Billy  Mitchell</b>. Colonel
Mitchell was an airpower visionary who saw the airplane dominating warfare and
called for an air force independent of the United States Army.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.2.1. Born to
wealthy American parents in Nice, France, on 29 December 1879, he grew up in
Wisconsin. He attended Racine College and Columbian College (now George
Washington University in Washington, District of Columbia) but abandoned
college at the beginning of the Spanish-American War and enlisted in the
military. His father, a United States Senator, applied influence and he
received a commission. Intelligent, able, and aggressive, Mitchell was the
youngest captain ever selected to join the General Staff (1912).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.2.2. In 1915,
Mitchell joined the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps and the following year
he took private flying lessons. During much of 1918, he commanded most of the
United States air combat units at the front. He added the use of aircraft in
mass to overwhelm the enemy to the British doctrine of taking the offensive. In
September 1918, he massed more than 1,500 United States and Allied aircraft in
support of the St. Mihiel offensive. In April 1921, Mitchell became Assistant
to the Chief of the Air Service. His outspoken advocacy of a separate air
force, critical remarks about the poor quality of the Air Service, and
criticism of superiors caused considerable controversy. Worse was his
methodology, which relied on appeals to Congress and the public outside the
chain of command, often in violation of direct orders. His claims that the
airplane could sink battleships ultimately led to bombing trials in June 1921.
During these trials, the 1st Provisional Air Brigade under Mitchell s
leadership sank the former German battleship&nbsp;<i>Ostfriesland</i>, which
was probably the high point of Mitchell's military career.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.21.2.3. Major General
Mason Patrick, Air Service commander after the bombing trials, was able to keep
Mitchell out of trouble for a time, but in 1925 further activities led the War
Department to refuse to reappoint him as Assistant Chief. Mitchell reverted to
his permanent rank of colonel and was assigned to Fort Sam Houston,
Texas.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.2.4. Even from
Texas, Mitchell used the press to continue to advocate an independent air
force. After the Navy dirigible&nbsp;<i>Shenandoah</i>&nbsp;was destroyed in a
storm, he charged senior military leadership with incompetence.</span></p>

<p><span>President Coolidge
personally ordered Mitchell's court-martial, and he was found guilty of
insubordination. Mitchell resigned his commission 1 February 1926 and died 19
February 1936.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="145" height="182" src="afh1_files/image053.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.3.&nbsp;<b>Major
General Benjamin D.  Benny  Foulois</b>. Foulois was a pioneer aviator and the
first commander of an American air unit in the field. He was born in
Connecticut, 9 December 1879. He enlisted in the Army at the time of the
Spanish-American War and was commissioned during his service in the Philippines
in 1901. In 1907, Foulois entered the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. In
1908 and 1909, Foulois participated in the acceptance tests of the Army's first
semirigid dirigible and its first airplane, a Wright flyer designated Signal
Corps No. 1. In 1910, Foulois took Signal Corps No. 1 to Fort Sam Houston,
Texas, where he conducted tests to demonstrate its military usefulness. He
remained in aviation until his retirement in 1935. In subsequent years, Foulois
participated in all aspects of early United States Army aviation and in 1915,
completed the organization of the Army's first operational unit, the 1st Aero
Squadron. Foulois commanded the squadron during the Mexican Punitive Expedition
in 1916-1917; the first deployment of a United States Army air unit to the
field. Following the Punitive Expedition, Foulois went to Washington, District
of Columbia, where he played a major role in planning and implementing the $640
million aviation program begun after the United States entered World War I.
Foulois was promoted to brigadier general and named Chief of the Air Service
for the American Expeditionary Force in November 1917.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.3.1. He was
unsuccessful, however, and was replaced by General Patrick in May 1918.
Foulois' subsequent work, especially as Patrick's assistant, however, played a
major role in Air Service success during the war.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.3.2. In 1927, he
moved to Washington, District of Columbia, to become Assistant Chief of the Air
Service, and in 1931 was promoted to major general and named Chief of the Air
Corps. Foulois proved a less-thaneffective Air Corps leader. A hands-on
individual, he tried to spend more time in the cockpit and less in the office.
A firm advocate of strategic bombardment and an independent air force, his
testimony before Congress was usually blunt and straightforward.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.3.3. In 1934,
Foulois agreed on short notice that the Air Corps could fly the United States
mail. The service proved ill-equipped for the effort, which damaged Foulois 
reputation. However, during his tenure, the Air Corps acquired its first B-17
heavy bombers and he helped organize General Headquarters Air Force in 1935; a
significant step toward Air Force independence. General Foulois retired 31
December 1935 and died 25 April 1967.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="156" height="201" src="afh1_files/image054.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.4.&nbsp;<b>General
of the Air Force Henry H.  Hap  Arnold</b>. General Arnold was an aviation
pioneer and is generally recognized as the father of the modern United States
Air Force, commanding the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.
Arnold was born in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, 25 June 1886, and graduated from
West Point in 1907. Originally an infantryman, he became a flyer in 1911. His
career paralleled the early development of United States military aviation. In
April 1911, the Signal Corps sent Arnold to Dayton, Ohio, where Wilbur and
Orville Wright taught him to fly. In 1912, he won the first Mackay Trophy for
making the most meritorious military flight of the year.&nbsp;<i>Promoted</i>&nbsp;to
temporary colonel, Arnold spent most of World War I as the highest-ranking
flying officer in Washington, District of Columbia. He would apply the lessons
he learned during the Great War to the development of the United States Army
Air Forces. Arnold began his rise to command of the Army Air Corps during the
interwar years, serving in Air Service headquarters in Washington, District of
Columbia, and in several of the most important operational flying commands in
the field. Promotion to lieutenant colonel came in 1931 and with it command of
March Field, California. In 1934, he took command of the western zone of the
United States.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.4.1. In 1934,
Arnold again won the Mackay Trophy, leading a flight of 10 B-10 bombers from Washington,
District of Columbia, to Fairbanks, Alaska. On 29 September 1938, he was named
Chief of the Air Corps. On 30 June 1941, he became Commanding General of the
United States Army Air Forces.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.4.2. General Arnold
commanded America's aerial war effort in World War II. Under his direction, the
United</span></p>

<p><span>States Army Air Forces
expanded from 22,000 members and 3,900 aircraft to nearly 2.5 million members
and 75,000 aircraft. Throughout the war he remained committed to strategic
bombardment, laying the foundation for a post-war independent air force. He
directly commanded the 20th Air Force B-29s during their 1944 and 1945 assault
on Japan. Supervising the air war on a global scale proved a strenuous task.
Arnold had a severe heart attack that led to his 30 June 1946 retirement.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.4.3. On 7 May 1949,
Congress appointed Arnold the first and only five-star General of the Air
Force. (He was a five-star General of the Army in 1944.) General Arnold died at
his home in Sonoma, California, 15 January 1950.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="180" height="183" src="afh1_files/image055.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.5.&nbsp;<b>General
Carl A.  Tooey  Spaatz</b>. General Spaatz, first Chief of Staff of the United
States Air Force, was born 28 June 1891, in Boyertown, Pennsylvania. He
graduated from West Point in 1914, entered the Aviation Section of the Signal
Corps in October 1915, and earned his wings in 1916. During World War I, Spaatz
served in France. He flew in combat for only three weeks but still shot down
three German planes. General Spaatz was one of the pioneering aviators of the
interwar years. For nearly a week, 1-7 January 1929, Spaatz and several other
officers kept the Question Mark, a Fokker trimotor, aloft over California.
During the 151-hour flight, the Question Mark refueled in the air 37 times,
nine of those after dark. In June 1933, he was assigned to Washington, District
of Columbia, as Chief of the Air Corps Training and Operations Division. While
attending the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in
September 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1936, Spaatz was assigned
as the executive officer, 2d Bomb Wing, Langley Field, Virginia. He returned to
Washington in 1939 to serve as Assistant Executive Officer to the Chief of the
Air Corps. In November 1939, he was promoted to colonel and transferred to
England to serve as a military observer. In October 1940, Spaatz returned to
Washington to accept a promotion to brigadier general and an assignment as
Assistant to the Chief of the Air Corps.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.5.1. After the war
began, Spaatz advanced rapidly through a succession of jobs. He commanded
Eighth Air Force before accepting command of the Northwest African Air Forces.
On 6 January 1944, he assumed command of United States Strategic Air Forces in
Europe, tasked with softening up Hitler's Fortress Europe, before the Allied invasion.
General Spaatz pinned on his fourth star in March 1945, prior to assuming
command of United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific Theater. He
oversaw the final strategic bombing campaign against Japan, including the 1945
use of atomic weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.5.2. In February
1946, Spaatz was promoted to Commanding General of the Army Air Forces and in
September 1947, President Harry S. Truman appointed him Chief of Staff of the
United States Air Force. He retired 30 June 1948, after which he served as the
Civil Air Patrol Chairman and Air Force Association Chairman of the Board from
1940 to 1951. A leading advocate of an Air Force Academy, General Spaatz died
in Washington, District of Columbia, 14 July 1974.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="141" height="182" src="afh1_files/image056.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.6.&nbsp;<b>Lieutenant
General Frank M. Andrews</b>. General Andrews was one of the founding fathers
of the modern Air Force and commander of the first combat Air Force. Killed in
an aircraft accident near Iceland, 3 May 1943, General Andrews was one of the
most promising Army Air Forces generals. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, 3
February 1884, he graduated from West Point in 1906 and entered the cavalry. He
served at several posts, from the Philippines to Vermont, before joining the
Aviation Division in August 1917, serving in the Office of the Chief Signal
Officer. In 1918, he was assigned to the Army General Staff Plans Division. He
was assigned to Germany in August 1920, where he served for three years in
public relations and civil affairs. Andrews returned to Kelly Field, Texas, in
1923, to serve as executive officer and, eventually, Commandant of Flying.
After attending the Air Corps Tactical School, he was assigned to 2d Wing
Headquarters, Langley Field, Virginia, as a staff officer. Andrews completed
the Army War College in May 1933, and subsequently, became Commander, 1st
Pursuit Group at Selfridge Field, Michigan. In October 1934, he returned to
Washington for a second tour on the General Staff.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.21.6.1. In March 1935,
General Andrews assumed command of the newly created General Headquarters Air
Force. In August 1939, he was named the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for
Operations and Training. In 1940, Andrews pinned on his second star and in
September 1941 was named Commanding General, Caribbean Defense Command.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.6.2. Andrews was
promoted to lieutenant general after America entered World War II, when he
assumed command of United States Forces in the Middle East. In February 1943,
he accepted command of United States Forces in the European Theater. His
premature death ended a career that showed great promise. In June 1949, Andrews
Air Force Base in Maryland was named in his honor.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="243" height="136" src="afh1_files/image057.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.7.<b>&nbsp;General
Ira C. Eaker</b>. General Eaker, aviation pioneer and articulate advocate of
aerospace power, was born in</span></p>

<p><span>Field Creek, Texas, 13
April 1896. In 1917, he graduated from Southeastern State Teachers College.
After accepting a commission in the Army Reserve, he attended flight school.
His first assignment was to the Philippines, where he did graduate work at the
University of the Philippines before returning to Mitchel Field, New York, in
1922. While serving in New York, he studied law at Columbia University.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.7.1. General Eaker
was a daring and innovative aviator. He participated in the Pan-American
goodwill tour of 1926 and 1927, and flew in the first extended aerial refueling
experiment in 1929, during which the crew kept a plane aloft for 151
hours.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.7.2. In the 1930s,
as war loomed over Europe, Eaker returned to Washington, District of Columbia,
to serve in the office of the Chief of the Air Corps. In 1940, as a lieutenant
colonel, he accepted command of the 20th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field,
California. In January 1942, shortly after the United States entered World War
II, Eaker took command of the VIII Bomber Command and was promoted to brigadier
general. A strong advocate of daylight strategic bombardment, he convinced
Prime Minister Winston Churchill that it had merit. Eaker directed the daylight
campaigns that pounded the German military and industrial base of Nazi-occupied
Europe and Germany.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.7.3. In September
1943, after promotion to lieutenant general, he served as commander of the
Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. After the war and until his August 1947
retirement, General Eaker was Deputy Commander, United States Army Air Forces
and Chief of the Air Staff.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.7.4. In 1947,
General Eaker accepted a position as vice president of Hughes Tool Company. He
served as a vice president of Douglas Aircraft from 1957-1961. In retirement,
General Eaker was an active writer, with regularly published articles and
columns in numerous newspapers and military journals. President Reagan promoted
him to four-star general, 10 April 1985. He died 6 August 1987.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="153" height="191" src="afh1_files/image058.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.8.&nbsp;<b>Major
General Oliver P. Echols</b>. General Echols, a pioneer logistician who
coordinated the rapid expansion of America's air arsenal during World War II,
was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, on 4 March 1892. Logistics play a vital
role in warfare, and his contribution was notable.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.8.1. Echols
attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute and the University of Virginia,
graduating in 1913. After graduation he enlisted in the United States Army. He
was commissioned in 1916 and was stationed in Europe with the Air Service in
July 1917. He commanded the 1st Observation Group and later became chief of
aviation for the 1st Army Corps. During World War I, Echols saw action in
several battles including those of the Chateau-Thierry, Aisne, St. Mihiel, and
in the Meuse-Argonne offensive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.8.2. After the war,
following several flying assignments, Echols served in the Air Corps
Experimental Engineering Section from 1927 to 1930. The following year he
became chief of the Air Corps Procurement Section. After graduating from the
Air Corps Tactical School in 1932, Echols returned to the procurement field as
Chief Engineer, Air Corps Materiel Division. In 1938, he was promoted to
assistant chief, and earned his first star and the promotion to division chief
in October 1940. During World War II, General Echols coordinated the most
massive aircraft procurement program in history, as Chief, Army Air Forces
Materiel Division. In 1947, he retired, accepting an offer to run the Aircraft
Industries Association. He died 15 May 1954.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.9.&nbsp;<b>Captain
Lillian K. Keil</b>. A pioneer in passenger care, Captain Keil successfully
combined two careers (airline flight attendant and Air Force flight nurse) to
become the most decorated woman in United States military history. Keil was one
of the first stewardesses hired by United Airlines when the United States
entered World War II. She was later accepted into the Army Air Forces and by
the summer of 1943, she was in England pulling wounded and frostbitten crewmen
out of B-17s returning from bombing raids over Europe. D-Day, 6 June 1944,
found her aboard a C-47, heading for Normandy to collect the wounded. During
the war, Keil made 250 evacuation flights, 23 of which were
transatlantic.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.9.1. After World
War II, Keil returned to United Airlines as an assistant chief stewardess. In
1950, she returned to duty as an Air Force flight nurse and flew to Korea.
During the next 16 months, she flew 175 air evacuations, logging 1,400 hours of
flight time while assigned to the 801st Medical Air Evacuation Transportation
Squadron.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.9.2. The Army Air
Forces captain attended to more than 10,000 wounded soldiers, sailors, and
marines in the air. She was awarded 19 medals, including a European Theater
medal with 4 battle stars, a Korean service medal with 7 battle stars, 4 air
medals, and a Presidential Citation from the Republic of Korea.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.9.3. Honored
several times by her hometown of Covina Hills, California, she was active in
the Covina Hills Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter until her death 30 June 2005.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.10.&nbsp;<b>General
George C. Kenny</b>. The United States Army Air Forces produced many great
operational air commanders in World War II. Leaders like Spaatz, Eaker, LeMay,
and Doolittle richly deserve acclaim, but some historians rank General Kenney
first among equals for his ability to overcome severe organizational,
logistical, personnel, technical, and strategic difficulties.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.10.1. Kenney
distinguished himself in World War I, flying 75 missions, downing two German
planes, and receiving the Distinguished Service Cross and Silver Star.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.10.2. His Army Air
Corps experiences enabled him to command air forces with such success during
World War II. He was the quintessential Air Corps officer in the sense that his
experience encompassed a broad range of functions, from maintenance, supply,
and production to strategy, tactics, and operations. He gained a reputation as
a technical and tactical innovator.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.10.3. During World
War II, as commander of the Southwest Pacific Area Allied Air Forces and the
Fifth Air Force, Kenney was General MacArthur's Airman. He created clear lines
of authority, instituted new supply and maintenance programs, commanded with
authority, and earned the respect and admiration of his men. Perhaps the most
daring and innovative commander of the war, Kenney gained MacArthur s
confidence because he knew how to run combat air forces and produced results
quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.10.4. Toward the
end of the war in the Pacific, General Arnold cabled Kenney:  It may truthfully
be said that no air commander ever did so much with so little.  MacArthur
wrote:  Of all the commanders of our major Air Forces engaged in World War II,
none surpassed General Kenney in those three great essentials of successful
combat leadership - aggressive vision, mastery over air strategy and tactics,
and the ability to exact the maximum in fighting quality from both men and
equipment.  General Kenney died 9 August 1977.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="160" height="199" src="afh1_files/image061.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.11.&nbsp;<b>General
James  Jimmy  Doolittle</b>. In a career defined by variety, General Doolittle
was a renaissance man: an air leader, aeronautical engineer, airplane racer,
businessman, commanding general, oil company executive, special assistant to
the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, and holder of the Medal of
Honor. Doolittle was born 14 December 1896, in Alameda, California. After a
year at the California School of Mines, he joined the Signal Corps Reserve in
1917 and earned his wings in 1918. Over the next 4 years he accepted a variety
of assignments in the Signal Corps aviation section, demonstrating exceptional
ability as a pilot and as a daredevil. He also continued his education, earning
a bachelor's degree from the University of California in 1922, a master s
degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1924, and a Ph.D. from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1925.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.11.1. His aviation
accomplishments are legendary. In September 1922, he flew a DH-4 coast-to-coast
in 22 hours, 35 minutes, with only one refueling stop. In 1925, he won the
Schneider Trophy Races, setting a seaplane speed record of</span></p>

<p><span>245.713 mph. He helped
develop fog-flying equipment in 1928, which led to widespread use of the
artificial horizontal and directional gyroscopes. He made the first  blind 
flight, completely dependent on instruments, for which he won the Harmon
Trophy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.11.2. He served as
Army advisor on the building of Floyd Bennett Field, New York City's first
municipal airport.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.11.3. Doolittle
resigned his regular commission in 1930 to manage Shell Oil's aviation
department. As part of his duties with Shell, he helped develop high-octane
gasoline and sold the Air Corps on the development of high-compression engines
using that fuel.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.11.4. General
Arnold brought Doolittle back to active duty in 1940 to troubleshoot engine and
aircraft development, but Doolittle is best remembered for leading the 18 April
1942 B-25 raid on Tokyo, launched from the deck of the aircraft carrier Hornet.
Though all 16 aircraft were lost, the raid restored American morale and damaged
Japanese confidence. It also earned Doolittle the Medal of Honor and promotion
to brigadier general.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.11.5. Promoted to
major general in November 1942, he commanded Twelfth Air Force in North Africa
and in January 1944 took command of Eighth Air Force in England. He was
promoted to lieutenant general&nbsp;
13 March 1944.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.11.6. After World
War II, Doolittle returned to civilian life as vice president of Shell Oil. He
was promoted to four-star General on the Air Force retired list in June 1985
and died 27 September 1993.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.12.&nbsp;<b>Major
General Claire L. Chennault</b>. Nicknamed  Old Leatherface,  General
Chennault, famed leader of the Flying Tigers, was born 6 September 1890 in
Commerce, Texas. He grew up in Louisiana and attended Louisiana State
University before joining the United States Army.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.12.1. Chennault was
commissioned a first lieutenant in November 1917 and earned his wings at Kelly
Field, Texas, in 1919. During the 1920s, Chennault earned a reputation as a
talented  stick and rudder man  and an absolute master of pursuit (fighter)
tactics. As a captain, Chennault graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School
in 1931, then remained at the school as an instructor, eventually becoming head
of the Pursuit Section. During the 1930s, such Air Corps Tactical School
instructors as Harold George, Robert Olds, and Kenneth Walker developed
doctrine advocating high altitude, daylight, precision bombing of key enemy
industrial and military targets using heavy bombers. In contrast, Chennault
stressed the importance of pursuit aviation, and advocated a system of air
defense based upon early warning of an enemy attack. Technology in the 1930s
was not in Chennault's favor. Bombers like the B-10 and B-17 became larger and
faster, and pursuers fell increasingly behind.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>1.21.12.2. Forced to
retired in 1937 for health reasons, Chennault went to China shortly after to
train pilots for the Chinese Air Force.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.12.3. In 1941,
Chennault recruited American military pilots and organized the American
Volunteer Group under a carefully hidden Roosevelt Administration program to
provide an air force for Chinese leader Chiang Kaishek. Chennault trained three
squadrons of  Flying Tigers' in tactics he had developed that took advantage of
the strengths of his Curtiss P-40s and exploited enemy weaknesses.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.12.4. Though the
American Volunteer Group did not enter combat until after Pearl Harbor, the
unit gained fame for its victorious exploits during the first six months of
World War II. In April 1942, the United States Army Air Forces recalled Chennault
to active duty, in the grade of major general, to command Fourteenth Air Force
in China. In that capacity, he fought two wars: one against the Japanese and
another against supply and equipment problems in isolated China.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.12.5. In October
1945, General Chennault retired again and in 1946 became president of the
China-based Civil Air Transport Company, assisting Chiang Kai-shek's losing
fight against Chinese Communist forces. On 18 July 1958, the Air Force promoted
Chennault to the honorary rank of lieutenant general. He died nine days later,
27 July 1958.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.13.&nbsp;<b>General
Curtis E. LeMay</b>. General LeMay, who made Strategic Air Command the world s
premier force, was born 15 November 1906. He attended the Ohio State University
and was commissioned through the Reserve Officer Training Corp program in 1928.
His military career began in September 1928 with flight training at March
Field, California.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.13.1. General LeMay
flew pursuit planes until 1937, when he transferred to the 2d Bomb Group, Langley
Field, Virginia. There, he earned a reputation as an outstanding pilot and
exceptional navigator. Accordingly, in late 1937 and early 1938, he served as
lead navigator for two mass flights of B-17s to South America.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.13.2. LeMay was
promoted to captain in January 1940, major in March 1941, and lieutenant
colonel in January 1942. He pinned on eagles three months later, when he took
command of the 305th Bombardment Group at Muroc, California. Later that year,
his group joined the Eighth Air Force in England. LeMay's no-nonsense approach
to combat earned him his first and second stars in September 1943 and March
1944. In August 1944, he assumed command of the XX Bomber Command in the
Pacific. His B-29s were charged with destroying Japan's war-making potential.
After the war, LeMay served at the Pentagon before his promotion and assignment
as Commander, United States Forces in Europe, in October 1947. His success at
directing the Berlin Airlift in 1948 made him the obvious choice for Strategic
Air Command commander-in-chief, in October 1948.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.13.3. LeMay made
Strategic Air Command the world's most powerful nuclear force. In the days
before the deployment of guided missiles, LeMay developed Strategic Air
Command's policy of constant alert, keeping some bombers aloft at all times,
ready to respond to a Soviet attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.13.4. In 1957,
General LeMay became Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, and in June 1961 rose to
Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. He held that post until his
retirement in February 1965. In 1968 he became the vice presidential candidate
on the American Independent Party ticket, headed by Alabama Governor George C.
Wallace. Defeated in November, LeMay returned to private life as chairman of
the board of an electronics firm. He died 1 October 1990.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.14.&nbsp;<b>Lieutenant
General William H. Tunner</b>. Known as the Air Force's outstanding
practitioner of air logistics and air mobility, General Tunner was born in
Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1906. After graduating from the United States
Military Academy in 1928, he entered the Air Corps and during the 1930s earned
a reputation as an excellent pilot and hardworking intelligence officer. During
World War II, Tunner helped create the United States Army Air Forces Ferrying
Command. By the time it became Air Transport Command, it was delivering 10,000
aircraft monthly from stateside factories to worldwide theaters of
operation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.14.1. In 1944,
Tunner assumed command of the  Hump  airlift operation, supplying China from
India over some of the world's highest mountain ranges. The often appalling
terrain and weather, equipment, facilities, and aircraft shortages made the
 Hump  a difficult operation. Tunner refined and standardized every element of
the operation, implementing assembly-line maintenance, systemizing
cargo-handling procedures, emphasizing flight safety, and imbuing the operation
with a driving</span></p>

<p><span>commitment to increase
tonnage. In July 1945 alone, Air Transport Command delivered 71,042 tons of
cargo. In June 1948, Air Transport Command and the Naval Air Transport Service
merged, becoming the Military Air Transport Service, and Tunner assumed command
of its Atlantic Division&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.14.2. On 24 June
1948, the Soviet Union blockaded the surface routes between Berlin and the
Western occupation zones in Germany. Allied leaders ordered an airlift to
supply Berlin, 26 June. On 28 July, Tunner assumed command of the airlift,
Operation VITTLES. Tunner developed an intricate bridge of aircraft that flowed
in a steady stream through narrow corridors in and out of Berlin. Before the
Soviet Union lifted the blockade 12 May 1949, Operation VITTLES delivered 2.3
million tons of cargo to Berlin. Under Tunner, the Berlin Airlift emerged as an
epic enterprise, demonstrating the peaceful use of airpower as a political
instrument.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.14.3. When the
Korean War broke out in June 1950, General Tunner took command of Combat Cargo
Command (Provisional). Tunner illustrated how a fleet of cargo aircraft was
sufficiently flexible to handle airborne assault while airdropping supplies,
and moving cargo and personnel through a combat theater. In the mid-1950s,
Tunner commanded United States Air Forces in Europe.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.14.4. His 1958
assumption of command of Military Air Transport Service provided the platform from
which he advocated large, jet-powered transports to support the global mission.
General Tunner retired in May 1960 and died 6 April 1983.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.15.&nbsp;<b>General
Charles P. Cabell</b>. General Cabell was a pioneer in the field of air
intelligence. He was born in Dallas, Texas, in 1903, graduated from the United
States Military Academy, 12 June 1925, and accepted a commission in the Field
Artillery. Five years later he transferred to the Air Corps Primary Flying
School at Brooks Field, Texas, graduating in February 1931. He then completed
the observation course at Kelly Field, Texas, where he remained as a flying
instructor.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.15.1. A lieutenant
at the time, Cabell joined the 7th Observation Squadron at France Field, Panama
Canal Zone, as adjutant in October 1931. He subsequently served as commanding
officer of the 44th Observation Squadron, the 24th Pursuit Squadron, and the
74th Pursuit Squadron, successively, at Albrook Field, Panama.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.15.2. In September
1938, he entered the Air Corps Tactical School at Maxwell Field, Alabama,
graduating in</span></p>

<p><span>June 1939. The following
June, Cabell, a major, was assigned to the Photographic Laboratory at Wright
Field, Ohio. After a period as an observer with the Royal Air Force, he
transferred to Washington, District of Columbia, in April 1941, to command the
Office of the Chief of the Air Corps Photo Unit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.15.3. In February
1942, Cabell, a lieutenant colonel, was named assistant executive for technical
planning and coordination. The following month, he became chief of the advisory
council to the commanding general of the Army Air Forces.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.15.4. From June to
October 1943, Cabell attended the first Army and Navy Staff College course. He
was assigned to the Eighth Air Force in the European Theater in October and in
December, assumed command of the 45th Combat Bombardment Wing. In April 1944,
he became director of plans for the United States Strategic Air Force in Europe
and three months later was named director of operations and intelligence for
the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, headquartered at Caserta, Italy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.15.5. General
Cabell later served as chief of the Strategy and Policy Division, Office of the
Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Plans. In December 1945, he was assigned to
the Military Staff Committee of the United Nations, followed by a promotion to
Chief, Air Intelligence Requirements Division, Office of the Director of
Intelligence in November 1947. On 15 May 1948, he was appointed Director of
Intelligence. On 1 November 1951 he was named director of the Joint Staff. He
and was appointed deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency
on&nbsp; 23 April 1953. Gen Cabell retired 31 January 1962; he died
25 May 1971.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.16.&nbsp;<b>General
Bernard A. Schriever</b>. Born in Germany, 14 September 1910, General Schriever
is recognized as the architect of Air Force ballistic missile and military
space programs. He came to America in 1917 and was naturalized in 1923. Raised
in San Antonio, Texas, he graduated from Texas A&amp;M in 1931 with a bachelor
of science degree in engineering. He was commissioned in the Field Artillery
but in July 1932 began flight training at Randolph Field, earning his Air Corps
wings and commission at Kelly Field in June 1933. He was a bomber pilot at
March and Hamilton Fields, California.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.16.1. He
participated in the ill-fated Army airmail program during the winter of 1934.
He served at Albrook Field, but in September 1937, he resigned from the Air
Corps to become a commercial pilot. Schriever returned to active duty in
October 1938, serving with the 7th Bomb Group at Hamilton, and a year later
became a test pilot at Wright Field. While there, he also attended the Air
Corps Engineering School, graduating in July 1941. He then earned his master of
science degree in aeronautical engineering at Stanford University.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.16.2. Schriever
distinguished himself during World War II, flying combat missions in the
Pacific theater. He took part in the Bismarck Archipelago, Leyte, Luzon, Papua,
North Solomon, South Philippine, and Ryukyu campaigns. After the war,
Schriever, a colonel, transferred to Headquarters Army Air Forces to serve as
chief scientific liaison in the Materiel directorate. In June 1950, he
graduated from the National War College and returned to the Pentagon. In June
1953 he was promoted to brigadier general. Schriever began his long association
with Air Research and Development Command, later Systems Command, in June 1954
as assistant to the commander. He was later appointed to head the Western
Development Division to organize and form what would become the ballistic
missile and space divisions that produced the Atlas, Titan, Thor, and
Minuteman. He also produced the launchers and space systems that supported the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other government
agencies.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.16.3. In April
1959, Schriever was named to head Air Research and Development Command. Two
years later, he was promoted to four-star general, and named to head the new
Air Force Systems Command.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.16.4. He brought
his systems approach to Air Force Systems Command and applied it to major
aeronautics and space programs. Schriever established 437L, an antisatellite
system, as part of his efforts to extend the Air Force mission to include space
and personally headed the Manned Orbiting Laboratory Project. He retired in
August 1966 and died 20 June 2005.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.&nbsp;<b>Colonel
Jacqueline  Jackie  Cochran</b>. Colonel Cochran was born in 1910 in Pensacola,
Florida. She was the first female pilot to break the sound barrier, doing so 18
May 1953.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.1.
After flying lessons at Roosevelt Field, Long Island, in 1932, she obtained her
license in 2   weeks, bought a plane, and began taking additional flying
lessons from Ted Marshall, a Navy pilot.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.2. In 1934,
after obtaining a commercial pilot's license, she entered the MacRobertson
Trophy Air Race from London to Melbourne, Australia. Although she didn t win
the 12,000-mile race, she won the first leg.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.3. In 1935, she
founded a cosmetic company and used the business to help finance the races she
entered. Next, she entered the Bendix Trophy Transcontinental Race (the Bendy),
a cross country race from Los Angeles to Cleveland. No woman had ever competed
in this prestigious race, and Cochran's and Amelia Earhart's applications were
initially denied because of their gender. But they protested and were allowed
to compete. Cochran's plane had mechanical problems, but Earhart came in fifth.
Cochran won first place in the women's division and third place overall in 1937
and took first place in 1938. In 1938, Cochran flew from New York to Miami in a
record-breaking 4 hours, 12 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.4. In 1939, she
set a new altitude and international speed record and became the first woman to
make a blind landing. In 1940, she broke the 2,000-kilometer international
speed record. She received the Clifford Burke Harmon Trophy as the outstanding
woman flier in the world in 1938, 1939, and 1940.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.5. During World
War II, she organized 25 women to fly for Great Britain and became the first
woman to fly a bomber across the Atlantic. She received the Distinguished
Service Medal for her services during the War.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.6. In 1943, she
was appointed to the staff of the United States Army Air Forces and director of
the Women's Air Force Service Pilots. She also set nine international speed,
distance, and altitude jet records.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.17.7. In 1971, she
was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame,  for outstanding
contributions to aviation by her devotion to the advancement of the role of
women in all of its aspects, and by establishing new performance records that
advanced aeronautics.  In 1975, she was the first woman to be honored with a
permanent display of her memorabilia at the United States Air Force Academy.
Colonel Cochran died 7 August 1980.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.18.<b>&nbsp;General
Benjamin O. Davis, Jr</b>. General Davis was the commander of the famed World
War II Tuskegee Airmen. At the time of his retirement in 1970, General Davis
was the senior African American officer in the armed forces. He was born in
Washington, District of Columbia, 18 December 1912, the son of Benjamin O.
Davis, Sr., the first black general in the United States Army.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.18.1. After
attending Case Western Reserve University and the University of Chicago,
General Davis graduated from West Point in 1936. Commissioned an infantry
officer, Davis was a Reserve Officer Training Corp instructor at Tuskegee
Institute from 1938 to 1941, when he became one of the first African Americans
admitted to pilot training.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.18.2. Davis
advanced rapidly in rank, making first lieutenant in June 1939, captain in
September 1940, and major and lieutenant colonel in the same month, May 1942.
In early 1942, soon after the United States entered the war, Davis organized
the 19th Fighter Squadron, an all-black unit that saw action over North Africa,
Sicily, and Italy. The following year, he organized the 332d Fighter Group,
which flew in Italy, Germany, and the Balkans. In May 1944, Davis was promoted

<p><span>1.21.19.<b>&nbsp;General
Daniel  Chappie  James, Jr</b>. General James distinguished himself as a leader
in three wars: World</span></p>

<p><span>War II, Korea, and
Vietnam. General James was born in Pensacola, Florida, in 1920. After
graduating from high school in 1937, James continued his studies at Tuskegee
Institute, Alabama. With war looming, James enrolled in the Civilian Pilot
Training Program, which opened for the first time to African Americans.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.19.1. From the
beginning of World War II until 1943, James served as a civilian flight instructor
at Tuskegee Army Airfield. In July 1943, following completion of flight
training, he accepted a commission as a second lieutenant, and joined the ranks
of the famed Tuskegee Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.19.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>James
completed fighter pilot training at Selfridge Field, Michigan, transferring to
various stateside bases through the war's end. He did not see combat during
World War II. In September 1949, became an 18th Fighter Wing, 12th Fighter
Bomber Squadron flight commander, stationed at Clark Field, Philippines.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.19.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>In
the skies over Korea, James faced his first combat experience while piloting
F-51 and F-80 aircraft. He flew more than 100 combat missions during the war.
In mid-1951, James was reassigned stateside as the flight operations officer,
58th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, flying
fighter jets.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.19.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>In
April 1953, he assumed command of the 60th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron in
Massachusetts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.19.5.<b>&nbsp;</b>James 
career continued to rise when he was assigned to Air Force headquarters as a
staff officer, Air</span></p>

<p><span>Defense Division, Office
of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. In July 1960, James transferred to
Great Britain, where he held numerous leadership positions in the 81st Tactical
Fighter Wing, including commander of the 92d Tactical Fighter Squadron, Royal
Air Force, Bentwaters, England. He later became the deputy commander for
operations of the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.19.6.<b>&nbsp;</b>James
saw combat during the Vietnam War, as well. In June 1967, he became the vice

<p><span>1.21.20.&nbsp;<b>Airman First Class John Lee Levitow</b>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.20.1. Airman
Levitow, an AC-47 gunship loadmaster, is the lowest ranking Airman ever to
receive the Medal of Honor for exceptional heroism during wartime. Born in
Hartford, Connecticut, Levitow attended Glastonbury High School. He was trained
in the civil engineering career field and later retrained into the loadmaster
field. After flying on C-130s out of McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, he was
deployed to Vietnam.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.20.2. On 24
February 1969, Airman Levitow was handling Mark 24 magnesium flares aboard</span></p>

<p><span> Spooky 71  when his
pilot threw the AC-47 and its eight-man crew into a turn to engage Viet Cong
whose muzzle flashes were visible outside the United States Army Depot at Long
Binh. The aircraft, an armed version of the C-47 Skytrain transport, had been
flying a night mission in the Tan Son Nhut air base area when Long Binh came
under attack.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.20.3. Suddenly,
Spooky 71 was jarred by a tremendous explosion and bathed in a blinding flash
of light. A North Vietnamese Army 82-millimeter mortar shell had landed on top
of the right wing and exploded inside the wing frame. The blast raked the
fuselage with flying shrapnel. Everyone in the back of Spooky 71 was wounded.
Despite his wounds, Levitow rescued a fellow crewmember who was perilously
close to the open cargo door. As he dragged his buddy toward the center of the
cabin, Levitow saw a loose, burning 27-pound magnesium flare rolling amid
ammunition cans that contained 19,000 live rounds.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.20.4. Through a
haze of pain and shock, Levitow, with 40 shrapnel wounds in his legs, side, and
back, fighting a 30 degree bank, crawled to the flare, but was unable to grasp
it to pick it up. He threw himself on the burning flare, hugging it to his
body, and dragged himself to the rear of the aircraft, leaving a trail of blood
behind. He hurled it through the open cargo door, and at that instant, the
flare separated and ignited in the air, fortunately clear of the aircraft. When
the aircraft returned to the base, the extent of the danger was apparent: The
AC-47 had more than 3,500 holes in the wings and fuselage, one measuring more
than three feet long. Levitow spent 2 1/2 months in a hospital and upon his
recovery, returned to Vietnam for another tour. He returned to the United
States to receive the Medal of Honor from President Nixon during a 14 May 1970
Armed Forces Day ceremony at the White House.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.20.5. Levitow was
promoted to sergeant before his honorable discharge four years later. On 22
January 1998, Air Mobility Command struck a resounding chord with the Air Force
enlisted corps when it named a C-17 Globemaster II  The Spirit of John
Levitow. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.20.6. Levitow
designed veterans' programs for the state of Connecticut until his 8 November
2000 death after a lengthy battle with cancer. He was buried with military
honors 17 November 2000 at Arlington National Cemetery.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.20.7. In his
memory, the Levitow Honor Graduate Award is presented to the top Air Force
Airman Leadership School graduate from each class. The Headquarters Building,
737th Training Group, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, was also dedicated in his
honor.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.21.<b>&nbsp;Staff
Sergeant William H. Pitsenbarger</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>On 11 April 1966, a
21-year-old known as  Pits' to his friends was killed while defending wounded
comrades. For his bravery and sacrifice, Pararescueman Pitsenbarger was
posthumously awarded the nation's highest military decorations: the Medal of
Honor and the Air Force Cross. He was the first enlisted Airman to receive both
medals posthumously.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.21.1. Pitsenbarger
was born in 1945 and grew up in Piqua, Ohio, a small town near Dayton. He
joined the Air Force on New Year's Eve 1962 and after pararescue training in
1965, reported to Detachment 6, 38th Air Rescue and Recovery Squadron, Bien Hoa
Air Base, near Saigon, Republic of South Vietnam. His unit, composed of five
aircrews, flew three HH-43F Kaman  Huskie  helicopters. His commander, Major
Maurice Kessler, referred to Pitsenbarger as  one of a special breed; alert and
always ready to go on any mission.  Pitsenbarger flew almost 300 rescue
missions in Vietnam, routinely risking his life to rescue downed soldiers and
Airmen.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.21.2. On 11 April
1966, Airman Pitsenbarger was aboard a rescue helicopter responding to a call
to evacuate casualties from an ongoing firefight approximately 35 miles east of
Saigon. When he arrived at the site, he descended from the helicopter to
organize and coordinate rescue efforts, care for the wounded, prepare
casualties for evacuation, and insure the recovery operation was smooth and
orderly. Several times he refused to evacuate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.21.3. Rescue helicopters
transported wounded to an aid station, returning to evacuate more injured. One
helicopter was hit by enemy fire as it lowered a litter basket to Pitsenbarger.
When its engine began to lose power, the pilot realized he had to get it away
from the area. Pitsenbarger chose to remain with the Army troops on the ground,
waving off the helicopter. Because of the heavy mortar and small-arms fire, the
helicopters couldn t return to the site.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.21.4. As the battle
raged, Pitsenbarger repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire in order to pull
wounded to safety and care for them, returning fire when possible. During the
fight, he was wounded three times. When others ran low on ammunition, he
gathered ammo clips from the dead and distributed them to the living. Having
administered aid, he picked up a rifle, joining the soldiers to help hold off
the Viet Cong. Pitsenbarger was killed by Viet Cong snipers later that night.
When his body was recovered the next day, one hand still held a rifle and the
other clutched a medical kit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.21.5. Although
Pitsenbarger didn t escape alive, nine men did, thanks to his courage and
devotion to duty. On 8 December 2000, Pitsenbarger's parents, William and
Alice, accepted the Medal of Honor from Secretary of the Air Force Whit Peters.
The audience included battle survivors, hundreds of pararescue airmen, a
Congressional representative, and the Air Force Chief of Staff. Pitsenbarger
was posthumously promoted to staff sergeant, and the Navy named an Air Force
munitions preposition ship the  MV A1C William H. Pitsenbarger  in his honor.</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.22.&nbsp;<b>Colonel
Eileen M. Collins</b>. Colonel Collins was the first woman to command a space
shuttle mission. An Air Force officer and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration astronaut, Colonel Collins was born 19 November 1956, in Elmira,
New York. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics and economics at
Syracuse University in 1978; a master of science degree in operations research
from Stanford University in 1986; and a master of arts degree in space systems
management from Webster University in 1989. Collins graduated from Air Force
Undergraduate Pilot Training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma, in 1979, served
as a T-38 instructor pilot at Vance, and in 1983 became a C-141 aircraft
commander and instructor pilot at Travis Air Force Base, California. From 1986
to 1989, she was an assistant professor of mathematics and a T-41 instructor
pilot at the United States Air Force Academy. By the time she retired from the
Air Force in 2005, Colonel Collins logged more than 6,750 hours in 30 different
types of aircraft.</span></p>



<p><span>1.21.22.1. In January
1990, National Aeronautics and Space Administration selected Colonel Collins
for the astronaut program while she was attending the Air Force Test Pilot
School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. She became an astronaut in July
1991, initially assigned to orbiter engineering support. She served on the
astronaut support team responsible for orbiter prelaunch checkout, final launch
configuration, crew ingress/egress, and landing/recovery, and also worked as a
mission control spacecraft communicator. She also served as the astronaut
office spacecraft systems branch chief, chief information officer, shuttle
branch chief, and astronaut safety branch chief.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.22.2. A veteran of
four space flights, Collins logged over 872 hours in space. STS-63 was the
first flight of the new joint Russian-American Space Program. Mission
highlights included the rendezvous with the Russian Space Station Mir, an
astronomy shuttle deployment and retrieval, and a space-walk. On this mission,
Colonel Collins became the first female pilot of a space shuttle.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.22.3. She flew on
STS-84 aboard the Atlantis 15-24 May 1997. It was National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's sixth Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the
Russian Space Station Mir. During the flight, the crew transferred nearly four
tons of supplies and experimental equipment.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.22.4. During
STS-93, flown by the Columbia, 22-27 July 1999, she became the first woman to
command a shuttle mission. This mission featured deployment of the Chandra
X-Ray Observatory.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.22.5. STS -114
Discovery, 26 July-9 August 2005, was the return to flight mission during which
the shuttle docked with the International Space Station and the crew tested and
evaluated new procedures for flight safety and shuttle inspection and repair
techniques. After a two-week, 5.8 million-mile-journey in space, the orbiter
and its seven-astronaut crew returned, landing at Edwards Air Force Base,
California.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.22.6. Colonel
Collins retired from National Aeronautics and Space Administration in May 2006.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="137" height="157" src="afh1_files/image073.jpg" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.23.&nbsp;<b>Senior
Airman Jason D. Cunningham</b>. Born 27 March 1975, Senior Airman Cunningham
earned the Air Force Cross for extraordinary heroism in military operations,
presented posthumously by the President of the United States, against an
opposing armed force while serving as a pararescueman near the village of
Marzak, Paktia Province, Afghanistan,&nbsp;4 March 2002.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.23.1. That day, Senior
Airman Cunningham was the primary Air Force combat search and rescue medic
assigned to a quick reaction force that had been tasked to rescue two American
servicemen from austere terrain occupied by Al Qaeda and Taliban forces.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.23.2. Shortly before
landing, his MH-47E helicopter took rocket-propelled grenade and small arms
fire, severely disabling the aircraft. The assault force formed a hasty defense
and immediately suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.23.3. Facing enemy
fire, risking his own life, Senior Airman Cunningham remained in the burning
fuselage in order to treat the wounded. He moved his patients to a more secure
location under mortar attack, disregarding the extreme danger, exposing himself
to enemy fire on seven separate occasions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>1.21.23.4. When the
second casualty collection point was also compromised, Senior Airman Cunningham
braved intense small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attack to reposition the
wounded to a third collection point. Mortally wounded and quickly fading, he
continued to direct patient movement, transferring care to another medic. His
selfless efforts resulted to the delivery of ten gravely wounded Americans to
life-saving medical treatment.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="166" height="166" src="afh1_files/image074.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>1.21.24.&nbsp;<b>Chief
Master Sergeant Richard L. Etchberger</b>. Born in 1933, Richard Loy  Dick 
Etchberger grew up in Pennsylvania, joining the Air Force in 1951. After
completing basic training, he attended a technical school at Keesler Air Force
Base, Mississippi, studying electronics, which would launch his career in radar
bomb scoring. One of the Air Force's most highly trained radar technicians, he
volunteered for a highly classified mission at Lima Site 85 in Laos. He was the
crew chief of a radar team there when North Vietnamese forces overran his radar
site 11 March 1968. Under heavy fire, he continued to defend his comrades,
called in air strikes, and directed an air evacuation. When a rescue helicopter
arrived, the chief put himself in the line of fire to load three other Airmen
in rescue slings. He was fatally wounded by enemy ground fire as he was being
rescued. His fierce defense prevented the enemy from closing on his position,
which saved his comrades lives, although he lost his own. For extraordinary
heroism and superb leadership, Chief Etchberger was posthumously awarded the
Air Force Cross, but the award remained a secret for two decades. He was
awarded the Medal of Honor on 21 September 2010, the first E-9 to receive this
award.</span></p>

1.23. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This chapter documents the
lives and activities of Airmen so you, the reader, will gain an understanding
of what it means to be an Airman. From Kitty Hawk to Afghanistan 108 years
later, the United States Air Force has grown into the finest Air Force in the
world. You can take pride in the efforts and accomplishments of enlisted
pioneers of the United States Air Force and its predecessor organizations who,
through their own sacrifices, made the Air Force enlisted corps what it is
today. Without their many contributions, none of that would have been possible.</span></p>



<p align="center"><b><span>Chapter 2</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>ENLISTED HISTORY</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 2A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>2.1.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The history of the Air
Force enlisted corps is long and varied. The United States Air Force traces
their origin to the establishment of the Aeronautical Division, created on 1
August 1907. The Army, however, first used  aerial devices' for military
purposes during the American Civil War, when President Lincoln created an
unofficial balloon section. From Benjamin Franklin to the second Seminole War
in 1840 to the war with Mexico in 1846, the Army has been interested in using
balloons for military purposes but never did. Consequently, enlisted support
for United States military aviation began with Civil War balloon operations.
This chapter examines how enlisted participation in the many wars and conflicts
throughout our history helped develop the United States Air Force into the
greatest Air Force in the World. Enlisted Airmen historically comprised some 80</span></p>

<p><span>percent of America's air
forces. From humble beginnings to today's great United States Air Force, the
enlisted corps deserves much of the credit for their development and great
accomplishments. Finally, the purpose for including this chapter within AFH
1,&nbsp;<i>Airman</i>&nbsp;is to provide enlisted Airmen reference material to
support their promotion tests.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 2B Milestones of
World War I and World War II</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>2.2.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Milestones
of World War I (1917-1918):</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When the first shots of the Great War were fired in Europe in
August 1914, the 1st Aero Squadron mustered a dozen officers, 54 enlisted men,
and 6 aircraft. By the end of 1915, the squadron counted 44 officers, 224
enlisted men, and 23 airplanes. This constituted the entire air arm of the
United States Armed Forces.</span></p>

<p><span>2.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>By 1916, a second aero squadron was added, assigned to duty in the
Philippine Islands, and new training facilities were added. In October 1916,
plans were laid for 24 squadrons: 7 to serve with the regular Army, 12 with the
National Guard, and 5 for coastal defense, supplementing balloon units for the
field and coast artillery. Each squadron was to muster a dozen aircraft. The
regular Army squadrons were either organized or in the process of being
organized by the end of 1916, and all 24 squadrons were formed by early 1917,
but only the 1st Aero Squadron was fully equipped, manned, and organized when
the United States declared war on Germany 6 April 1917.</span></p>

<p><span>2.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>By April 1917, the United States Army Aviation Section consisted
of 131 officers (virtually all pilots or pilots-intraining), 1,087 enlisted
men, and had fewer than 250 airplanes. Even as the war in Europe dragged on,
the United States Congress refused to appropriate significant funds for Army
aeronautics. The Army's poor state of preparedness could not be laid entirely
at Congress' feet. The Army had no plan to enable them to build an air force
and did not send trained observers to Europe. General staff officers were so
out of touch with modern aerial warfare requirements that their chief complaint
about air personnel was the disrespectful manner in which flying officers
flouted regulations by refusing to wear their cavalry spurs while flying
airplanes.</span></p>

<p><span>2.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Tradition dictated that pilots be drawn from the ranks of
commissioned officers, but the Aviation Section soon realized the pressing need
for trained enlisted personnel to perform duties in supply and construction and
to serve specialized functions in the emerging aviation-related fields of photo
reconnaissance and radio. Most of all, the Aviation Section needed mechanics. The
war demanded engine mechanics, armament specialists, welders, riggers, and sail
makers. The Army first pressed factories into service as training sites, but by
the end of 1917, the Aviation Section began training mechanics and others at a
number of special schools and technical institutions. The two largest were in
St Paul Minnesota and at Kelly Field Texas. Later, mechanics and other enlisted
specialists were also trained at fields and factories in Great Britain and
France.</span></p>

<p><span>2.2.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In addition to the specialized roles directly associated with
flying, Air Service enlisted personnel performed a wide variety of
administration, mess, transport, and medical corps support functions.
Construction personnel, who built the airfields, hangars, barracks, and other
buildings, were often the first enlisted men stationed at various overseas
locations.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.3. Milestones of World War II (1939-1945).</span></b></p>

<p><span>Even before the outbreak
of hostilities in Europe, the General Headquarters Air Force had begun a
massive expansion program that would balloon during the following years into
the largest air organization in the nation's history. In 1939, President
Franklin D. Roosevelt asked for $300 million for military aviation. The Air
Corps planned to have 24 operational combat-ready groups by 1941 which would
require greatly enhanced manpower, training, and equipment.</span></p>

<p><span>2.3.1.&nbsp;<b>The Air Corps Prepares for War:</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.3.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In 1938, when the United States first took seriously the signs of
war in Europe, the Army's air arm was still under two cumbersome command
organizations: the Army Air Corps and General Headquarters Air Force. The total
force included less than 20,000 enlisted members. In 1940, Congress passed the
first peacetime conscription law in United States history. By March 1944 when
Air Force manpower reached their high point, 2,104,405 enlisted men and women
were serving in a virtually independent branch of the armed services. Moreover,
they operated a sophisticated machine of air war that covered nearly the entire
globe.</span></p>

<p><span>2.3.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>From 1939 until 1941, the concept of training did not change
drastically, but the scale did. Training centers expanded and multiplied. Ever
larger numbers of new Airmen passed through advanced training as the overall
goals for assembling combat-ready groups increased. The air corps simply could
not build housing fast enough or find qualified instructors in sufficient
numbers to keep up with the pace. Army officials turned to private schools to
help meet the demand, and many mechanics, for example, received training in one
of the 15 civilian schools.</span></p>

<p><span>2.3.2.&nbsp;<b>World War II - The Great Central,
Cataclysmic 20th Century Event:</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.3.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>More than 2 million enlisted Airmen served in the United States
Army Air Forces during the largest war ever. Most of them aside from a small
number of prewar soldiers were not professional warriors. Some carried out
routine duties in safe if unfamiliar surroundings, while others endured extreme
conditions in faraway places for years. Tens of thousands died in combat, and
scarcely any remained unchanged by the war.</span></p>

<p><span>2.3.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Before the United States could engage the enemy, they needed more
personnel, training, and equipment. Thus, 1942 was a year of buildup and
training; processes that continued throughout the war. According to one former
8th Air Force gunner,  It took an average of about 30 men to support a
bomber I m talking about a fourengine bomber, whether a B-24 or a B-17, they
are about the same thing yet you had to have somebody riding a gasoline truck,
oil trucks; you had to have a carburetor specialist and armaments and so forth,
sheet metal work; if you got shot up, they had to patch the holes. These people
were very important and they worked 18 to 20 hours a day when you came back. </span></p>

<p><span>2.3.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If anything, the gunner underestimated the number of guys on the
ground required to keep planes in the air. No accurate figure exists across the
board for World War II, but taking into account all the support personnel in
the Army Air Corps, the ratio was probably closer to 70 men to 1 airplane.
During the war, the great majority of the more than 2 million enlisted Airmen
served in roles that never took them into the air, but without their efforts,
even the most mundane or menial, no bombs would have dropped and no war would
have been waged.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 2.1. Women's Army</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Auxiliary Corps.</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="210" height="293" src="afh1_files/image136.png" ></span></p>





<p><span>2.3.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Women served with distinction in the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>United States Army Air
Forces,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>replacing men who could then be reassigned to
combat and other vital duties. The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps was created in
May 1942 (Figure 2.1). Top priority for assignment of Women's Army Auxiliary
Corps was to serve at aircraft warning service stations. In the spring of 1943,
the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps became the Women's Army Corps. Almost half of
their peak strength served with the United States Army Air Forces with many
assigned to clerical and administrative duties, while others worked as
topographers, medical specialists, chemists, and even aircraft mechanics. Some
commanders were reluctant to accept women into their units, but by mid-1943,
the demand for them far exceeded the numbers available.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>2.3.2.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When the Air Force became a distinct service in 1947, segregation
policies were transferred, but the new organization confronted special
difficulties in maintaining the separation, especially in the case of enlisted
Airmen. Official restrictions that forced black Airmen to serve either in
allblack units or in segregated service squads robbed the Air Force of a major
talent pool. On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter 35.3 was published, mandating
that black Airmen be screened for reassignment to formerly all-white units
according to qualifications. Astoundingly, within a year, virtually the entire
Air Force was integrated, with few incidents.</span></p>

<p><span>2.3.2.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In the spring of 1945, after 3   years of
carnage, the end of the war seemed inevitable. The 1944 invasion of Europe and
Allied ground forces' grinding advance toward Berlin finally destroyed Germany.
The Third Reich surrendered in May 1945. With Europe calmed, American forces
turned their attention to Japan. The American high command expected the final
struggle in the Pacific would require relentless attacks against a fanatical
foe. Despite widespread destruction of Japanese cities by low-level B-29 fire
bombings throughout the spring and summer of 1945, Japan continued to resist.
United States commanders realized that only an American invasion of the
Japanese islands and subjugation of the Japanese would force the empire to
surrender unconditionally, as the Allies demanded.</span></p>

<p><span>2.3.2.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>United States Army Air Forces enlisted crews flew thousands of
combat missions during World War II, but there were two missions over Japan in
August 1945 that changed the world. They were the flight of the&nbsp;<i>Enola
Gay&nbsp;</i>(Figure 2.2), 6 August 1945, to drop the world's first nuclear
bomb on Hiroshima; and the flight of&nbsp;<i>Bock's Car&nbsp;</i>(Figure 2.3),
3 days later to drop the second bomb on the city of Nagasaki.</span></p>

Berlin Airlift, Korean War, and War in Southeast Asia</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>2.4.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>The
Cold War (1948-1991).</span></b></p>

<p><span>Although the United
States and their Western allies had counted on the Soviet Union as a heroic
nation struggling with them against Hitler. Apparent even before World War II
ended was that the alliance would not survive the ideological gulf that
separated capitalist democracies from the Communist giant. In 1945, the Big
Three British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet Premier Josef Stalin,
and American President</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Franklin D. Roosevelt met to discuss the postwar</span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><span>division of Europe. The meeting did not go well, but did lay the
foundation for what would become the United Nations. In 1946, the fledgling
United Nations took up the issue of controlling nuclear weapons. By June 1946,
a United Nations-appointed commission completed a plan for the elimination of
nuclear weaponry based on inspectors who would travel the globe to ensure no
country was making atomic bombs, and to supervise the dismantling of existing
weapons. Unfortunately, the plan was vetoed by the Soviet Union, resulting in
almost five decades of cold war.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.5.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>The
Berlin Airlift (1948-1949):</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In June 1948, the Soviet Union exploited the arrangements under
which the United States, Great Britain, and France had occupied Germany by
closing off all surface access to the city of Berlin. If left unchallenged, the
provocative actions of the communists may not only have won them an important
psychological victory, but may also have given them permanent control over all
of Berlin. Worried that an attempt to force the blockade on the ground could precipitate
World War III, the allies instead built a Luftbr cke an air bridge into Berlin.</span></p>

<p><span>2.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For their part, the Soviets did not believe resupply of the city
by air was feasible, let alone practical. The Air Force turned to Major General
William Tunner, who led the Hump airlift over the Himalayan Mountains to supply
China during World War II. As the nation's leading military air cargo expert,
he thoroughly analyzed United States airlift capabilities and requirements and
set in motion an airlift operation that would save a city.</span></p>

<p><span>2.5.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For 15 months, the 2.2 million inhabitants of the Western sectors
of Berlin were sustained by airpower alone as the operation flew in 2.33
million tons of supplies on 277,569 flights (Figure 2.4). Although airlift came
of age during World War II, full potential was achieved during the Berlin
airlift, which was arguably airpower's single-most decisive contribution to the
Cold War, unquestionably achieving a profound strategic effect.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>2.6.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The 25 June 1950 surprise invasion of South Korea by North Korean
armed forces caught the United States Air</span></p>

<p><span>Force ill-prepared to deal with a conventional war in a remote
corner of the world. The resulting confusion and makeshift responses fell short
of requirements during the active course of the war; conditions made even more
difficult by the drastic swings of military fortune during 1950 and 1951 on the
Korean peninsula. The conflict imposed acute difficulties on enlisted Airmen,
and throughout the Korean War, Airmen were called on to serve under the most
dangerous and frustrating conditions.</span></p>

<p><span>2.6.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>By 1950, most United States ground and air strength in the Pacific
was in Japan. Although the Far East Air Forces, led by General George
Stratemeyer, claimed more than 400 aircraft in Japan, Guam, Korea, and the
Philippines, the numbers were misleading. The force consisted largely of F-80
jets, which did not have the range necessary to reach Korea from Japan. The
first aerial combat between the United States and North Korea took place over
Kimpo, South Korea 27 June 1950. On 29 June, B-26 gunner Staff Sergeant Nyle S.
Mickley shot down a North Korean YaK-3, the first such victory recorded during
the war. Enlisted personnel served as gunners aboard the B-26 for the first
several months of the conflict, and on B-29 aircraft throughout the war.</span></p>

<p><span>2.6.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>On 15 September 1950, United States forces spearheaded by the
First Marine Division successfully landed at Inchon, near Seoul, South Korea,
effectively cutting North Korean Army supply lines deep in the south,
threatening the rear (Figure 2.5). The United States Eighth Army launched their
own offensive from Pusan a day later, and what once was a stalled North Korean
offensive became a disorganized retreat. So complete was the rout that less
than a third of the 100,000-strong North Korean Army escaped to the north. On
27 September 1950, President Truman authorized United States forces to pursue
the beaten Army north of the 38th parallel.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 2.5. Combat Command Personnel and</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Supplies</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.6.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Airpower played a significant role in</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>the Allied offensive. Airlift actions ranged from the spectacular,
to include the drop of the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team to cut off
retreating North Korean troops, to the more mundane but critical airlift of
personnel and supplies. Foreshadowing the versatility that was exhibited by the
B-52 in later decades, Far East Air Forces B-29s performed a number of missions
not even considered before the war, to include interdiction, battlefield
support, and air superiority (counter airfield).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.7.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>The War in Southeast Asia (1950-1975).</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Truman
Administration did not pursue total victory in Korea, in part to maintain
United States defensive emphasis on Western Europe. The next major conflict for
the United States Armed Forces, however,&nbsp;once again took place in Asia.</span></p>

<p><span>2.7.1.&nbsp;<b>The Early
Years (1950-1964):</b>2.7.1.1. In the 1950s, the United States' involvement in
Vietnam began as a cold war operation. Vietnam was essentially a French battle.
However, the post-World War II policy of containment of communism prompted
President Truman to intervene. He increased aid and ordered eight C-47
transports directly to Saigon, the first American Air Force presence in
Vietnam. On 3 August 1950, the first contingent of the United States Military
Assistance Advisory Group arrived in Saigon.</span></p>

<p><span>2.7.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>By 1952, the United States supplied one-third of the cost of the
French military effort in Vietnam, yet what was becoming apparent was that the
French were losing heart. On 4 January 1953, the United States deployed the
first sizable contingent of Air Force personnel (other than those attached to
the Military Assistance Advisory Group). This group included a complement of
enlisted technicians (Figure 2.6) to handle supply and aircraft
maintenance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>2.7.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In April 1953, the Viet Minh (under Ho Chi</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Minh's direction) staged a major offensive, advancing into Laos
and menacing Thailand. President Eisenhower authorized C-119 transports
(aircraft only, not crews) to the area, and in 1954 loaned additional cargo
planes to the French. Because French air units were seriously undermanned,
United States officials made the fateful decision on 31 January 1954 to
dispatch 300 Airmen to service aircraft at Tourane and Do Son Airfield near
Haiphong, North Vietnam.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 2.6. Enlisted
Technicians.</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.7.1.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As Air Force presence increased in the early 1960s, so did the
need for support personnel. Priorities included construction of airfields and
barracks, and intelligence-gathering.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 2D The Air War
Expands, Vietnamization, Humanitarian Airlift, and Post-Vietnam Conflicts</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>2.8.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>The Air War Expands (1965-1968):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.8.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>On 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attacked Camp Holloway near
Pleiku, killing eight Americans. The President responded with Operation FLAMING
DART, a series of strikes against military barracks near Dong Hoi in North
Vietnam, as well as other targets. Increased airstrikes against targets in the
northern half of the country, code name Rolling Thunder, began less than a
month later on 2 March. Rolling Thunder was the first sustained bombing
campaign of the war against North Vietnam, lasting through 1968.</span></p>

<p><span>2.8.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As offensive air operations increased, United States Air Force
presence in Southeast Asia also increased. About 10,000 Air Force personnel
served in Vietnam in May 1965, doubling by the end of the year. As 1968 drew to
a close, 58,000 Airmen served in the country. Airmen performed various duties,
including support, combat and rescue (Figure 2.7). Prime BEEF personnel, for
example, built revetments, barracks, and other facilities. Rapid engineering
and heavy operational repair squadron, engineering (REDHORSE) teams provided
more long-range civil engineer services. In the realm of combat operations, Air
Force gunners flew aboard gunships as well as B-57s and B-52s. In December
1972, B-52 tail gunner Staff Sergeant Samuel Turner shot down an enemy MiG, the
first of only two confirmed shoot-downs by enlisted Airmen during the war. Both
victories were from gunners belonging to the 307th Strategic Wing at U-Tapao,
Thailand. Credit for the fifth overall MiG-21 kill during Linebacker II also
went to an enlisted member, Airman First Class Albert E. Moore.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 2.7. Medical Evacuation System</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.8.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enlisted personnel also served on gunships during the war as both
aerial gunners and as loadmasters. With the Gatling-style guns actually aimed
by the pilot through speed, bank, and altitude, the responsibility of the
aerial gunners was to keep the quick-firing guns reloaded. Crewmembers
occupying this position were particularly vulnerable to ground fire. Meanwhile,
loadmasters released flare canisters over target areas during night missions,
another hazardous undertaking.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>2.8.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Air Force enlisted members faced combat on the ground as well.
With the continuing threat of guerrilla attack, air base defense became a
monumental undertaking performed almost exclusively by Air Force security
police squadrons. Staff Sergeant William Piazza, 3d Security Police Squadron earned
the Silver Star for helping defend Bien Hoa during the North Vietnamese Tet
Offensive of 1968.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.9.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Vietnamization and Withdrawal (1969-1973):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.9.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Since the Eisenhower years, American presidents wanted the Vietnam
conflict to be fought and resolved by the Vietnamese. Through 1963 and much of
1964, American forces operated under restrictive rules of engagement in an
effort to maintain the United States role as advisory only. On 22 November
1963, embroiled in a deteriorating situation in Vietnam, President Kennedy was
assassinated and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took office. After the Gulf
of Tonkin incident and the Senate resolution of 1964, the advisory role rapidly
evolved into one of combat operations. Yet the Air Force never stopped working
with the Vietnamese Air Force to develop an ability to prosecute the war
itself. In January 1969, shortly after taking office, President Nixon announced
an end to United States combat in Southeast Asia as a primary goal of his
administration. He charged the Secretary of Defense with making Vietnamization
of the war a top priority.</span></p>

<p><span>2.9.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Enlisted Airmen played key roles, especially in training
Vietnamese operational and training crews. As the Vietnamese took over air
operations, the nation's air force grew to become the fourth largest in the
world. In May 1969, the withdrawal of United States Army ground units from
Vietnam began in earnest, while air support units lingered. In 1972, taking
advantage of reduced American ground presence, Communist forces of the National
Liberation Front crossed the demilitarized zone, President Nixon ordered
harbors mined, and Peace talks broke down completely.</span></p>

<p><span>2.9.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>President Nixon ordered 11 days of intensive bombing of Vietnamese
cities, with B-52s from Andersen Air Force</span></p>

<p><span>Base, Guam carrying out
the mission called  Linebacker II.  Linebacker II succeeded in breaking the
deadlock, and the North Vietnamese resumed negotiations. A cease-fire agreement
was hammered out by 28 January 1973.</span></p>

<p><span>2.9.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>While Linebacker II was a success, Vietnam was no ordinary war.
The cease-fire did not bring an end to the fighting, and the punishment
aircrews delivered did not bring victory. Nevertheless, the United States was
committed to withdrawal. On 27 January 1973, the military draft ended; on 29
March, the last United States troop left the country; and even though another
cease-fire agreement was drawn up to end previous cease-fire violations,
fighting continued until April 22 when the president of South Vietnam resigned.
North and South Vietnam were officially unified under a Communist regime on 2
July 1976.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.10. Humanitarian Airlift:</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.10.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The history of humanitarian airlift by United States Armed Forces
is almost as old as the history of flight itself. Army aircraft flying out of
Kelly Field Texas, for example, dropped food to victims of a Rio Grande flood
in 1919, one of the first known uses of an aircraft to render assistance. Many
early domestic humanitarian flights were flown in response to winter
emergencies. In March 1923, Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland sent airplanes to
bomb an ice jam on the Delaware River and an aircraft from Chanute Field
Illinois dropped food to stranded people on South Fox Island in Lake Michigan.
From blizzards and floods to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, Army Air Corps
personnel and aircraft provided relief.</span></p>

<p><span>2.10.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Army aircraft also flew humanitarian missions to foreign nations
before the United States Air Force was established. In February 1939, the 2d
Bombardment Wing delivered medical supplies to earthquake victims in Chile Four
years later, in the midst of World War II, a B-24 from a base in Guatemala
dropped a life raft with the diphtheria vaccine to a destroyer escorting a
British aircraft carrier. The destroyer delivered the vaccine to the carrier,
preventing a shipboard epidemic. In September 1944, United States Army Air
Forces planes dropped food to starving French citizens; in May 1945, B-17s
delivered food to hungry people in the Netherlands during Operation CHOWHOUND.</span></p>

<p><span>2.10.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Humanitarian efforts continued after the Air Force became a
separate service and through the ensuing decades</span></p>

<p><span>During Operation SAFE
HAVEN I and II, in 1956 and 1957, the Military Air Transport Service 1608th Air
Transport Wing, Charleston Air Force Base South Carolina, and 1611th Air
Transport Wing, McGuire Air Force Base New Jersey, airlifted over 10,000
Hungarian refugees to the United States. President Eisenhower approved asylum
for the refugees who fled Hungary after Soviet forces crushed an anticommunist
uprising there. In May 1960, earthquakes followed by volcanic eruptions,
avalanches, and tidal waves ripped through southern Chile, leaving nearly
10,000 people dead and a quarter of a million homeless. The United States
Department of Defense and State Department agreed to provide assistance. During
the month-long  Amigos Airlift,  the 63d Troop Carrier Wing from Donaldson Air
Force Base South Carolina and the 1607th, 1608th, and 1611th Air Transport
Wings airlifted over 1,000 tons of material to the stricken area.</span></p>

<p><span>2.10.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>America's commitment to South Vietnam led to many relief flights
to that country during the 1960s and 1970s. In November 1964, three typhoons
dumped 40-plus inches of rain on the country's central highlands, killing 7,000
people and destroying 50,000 homes. HH-43F helicopters from Detachment 5,
Pacific Air Rescue Center, plucked 80 Vietnamese from rooftops and high ground
in the immediate aftermath of the storms. Over the next 2 months, various Air
Force units moved more than 2,000 tons of food, fuel, boats, and medicine to
the ravaged area. Less than a year later, in August 1965, fighting in Da Nang
displaced 400</span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><span>orphaned children. To move them out of harm s
way, 315th Air Division C-130s airlifted the orphans to Saigon. In 1975,
following the fall of Cambodia and South Vietnam to Communist forces,
transports from 11 Air Force wings and other units airlifted more than 50,000
refugees to the United States. This airlift, which included Operations
BABYLIFT, NEW LIFE, FREQUENT WIND, and NEW ARRIVALS, was the largest aerial
evacuation in history. In addition to refugees, Air Force units also moved
5,000 relief workers and more than 8,500 tons of supplies.</span></p>

<p><span>2.10.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Aside from the Vietnamese evacuation of the 1970s and the Berlin
airlift in the late 1940s, the most significant humanitarian airlift operations
took place in the 1990s. In 1991, following the Persian Gulf War, Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein attacked the Kurdish population in northern Iraq. In response to
the unfolding human tragedy, Air Force transports in support of Operation
PROVIDE COMFORT provided more than 7,000 tons of blankets, tents, food, and
more to the displaced Kurds, and airlifted thousands of refugees and medical
personnel. Operation SEA ANGEL, in which the Air Force airlifted 3,000 tons of
supplies to Bangladesh, followed a 1991 typhoon. Operation PROVIDE HOPE in 1992
and 1993 provided 6,000 tons of food, medicine, and other cargo to republics of
the former Soviet Union. In 1994, the Air Force carried 3,600 tons of relief
supplies to Rwandan refugees in war-torn central Africa.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.11. Post-Vietnam Conflicts:</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.11.1.&nbsp;<b>Operation URGENT FURY, Grenada
(1983):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.11.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In October 1983, a military coup on the tiny Caribbean island
nation of Grenada aroused United States attention. Coup leaders arrested and
then assassinated Prime Minister Maurice Bishop, imposed a 24-hour
shooton-sight curfew, and closed the airport at Pearls on the east coast, about
12 miles from the capital of St. George s, located on the opposite side of the
island. President Ronald W. Reagan, who did not want a repetition of the
Iranian hostage crisis a few years earlier, considered military intervention to
rescue hundreds of United States citizens attending medical school on the
island.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Twenty-six Air Force wings, groups, and squadrons supported the
invasion by 1,900 United States Marines and Army Rangers. Airlift and special
operations units from the Military Airlift Command comprised the bulk of the
Air Force fighting force. AC-130 gunships in particular proved their worth
repeatedly, showing more versatility and accuracy than naval bombardment and
land artillery. Several Air Force enlisted personnel were among 10 Air Force
Grenada veterans cited for special achievement who received special praise for their
efforts. Among them, Sergeant Charles Tisby, a loadmaster, saved the life of an
unidentified paratrooper in his aircraft. When his C-130 banked sharply to
avoid antiaircraft fire, one paratrooper's static line fouled and left the
trooper still attached to the aircraft. Tisby, with the help of paratroopers
still on board, managed at significant personal risk to haul the man back in.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.2.&nbsp;<b>El Dorado Canyon, Libya (1986):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.11.2.1.&nbsp;In 1969,
a group of junior military officers led by Muammar Qadhafi overthrew the
pro-Western Libyan Arab monarchy. By the mid-1980s, Libya was one of the
leading sponsors of worldwide terrorism. In addition to subversion or direct
military intervention against other African nations and global assassinations
of anti-Qadhafi Libyan exiles and other  state enemies,  Qadhafi sponsored
terrorist training camps within Libya and supplied funds, weapons, logistical
support, and safe havens for numerous terrorist groups.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.2.2.&nbsp;Between
January 1981 and April 1986, terrorists worldwide killed over 300 Americans and
injured hundreds more. With National Security Decision Directive 138 signed on
3 April 1984, President Reagan established in principle a United States policy
of preemptive and retaliatory strikes against terrorists. On27 December 1985,
terrorists attacked passengers in the Rome and Vienna airports. Despite the
strong evidence that connected Libya to the incident, the United States
administration determined they did not have sufficient proof to order
retaliatory strikes against Libya. President Reagan imposed sanctions against
Libya, publicly denounced Qadhafi for sponsoring the operation, and sent the
6th Fleet to exercise off the coast of Libya.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.2.3.&nbsp;In
Berlin, 5 April 1986, a large bomb gutted a discotheque popular with United
States service members. This time President Reagan had the evidence he sought.
On 9 April, he authorized an air strike against Libya and attempted to obtain
support from European allies. Great Britain gave permission for the United
States Air Force to use British bases; however, the governments of France and
Spain denied permission to fly over their countries, thereby increasing the Air
Force's round trip to almost 6,000 miles. By 14 April 1986, all Air Force
forces were gathered and ready.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.2.4.&nbsp;Politically,
the raid against the terrorist state was extremely popular in the United States
and almost universally condemned or  regretted  by the United States' European
allies who feared that the raid would spawn more violence. The operation spurred
Western European governments to increase their defenses against terrorism and
their intelligence agencies began to share information. The Air Force was
saddened by the loss of an F-111F crew, but the loss of one out of over a 100
aircraft used in the raid statistically was not a high toll. Despite the high
abort rate, collateral damage, and loss of innocent lives after a flight of
more than 6 hours and in the face of strong enemy opposition the Air Force
successfully hit three targets previously seen only in photographs.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.3.&nbsp;<b>Operation JUST CAUSE, Panama
(1989):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.11.3.1.&nbsp;Since
Panama's declaration of independence from Colombia in 1903, the United States
has maintained a special interest in this small Central American country. The
United States controlled and occupied the Panama Canal Zone, through which they
built a 40-mile long canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
President Woodrow Wilson formally opened the canal on 12 July 1915. Political
and domestic conditions in Panama remained stable until 1968, when a military
ruler deposed the country's president. A new treaty took effect 1 October 1979,
granting Panama complete control of the canal and dictating withdrawal of
United States military forces by 1 January 2000.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.3.2.&nbsp;A 1981
leadership struggle culminated in 1983; General Manuel Noriega prevailed.
Noriega maintained ties with the United States intelligence community,
furnishing information on Latin American drug trafficking and money laundering,
while at the same time engaging in such activities. By 1987, brutal repression
of his people was enough for the United States Senate to issue a resolution
calling for the Panamanians to oust him. Noriega in turn ordered an attack on
the United States Embassy, causing an end to United States military and
economic aid. In 1988, a Miami federal grand jury indicted Noriega on
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. Noriega intensified his
harassment against his own people and all Americans. By 1989, President George
H. W. Bush decided to invade Panama.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.3.3.&nbsp;All four
branches of the United States Armed Forces played a role in Operation JUST
CAUSE. Air Force participation included elements of 18 wings, 9 groups, and 17
types of aircraft. On the first night of the operation, 84 aircraft flying 500
feet above the ground dropped nearly 5,000 troops, the largest nighttime
airborne operation since World War II. The airdrop also featured the first Air
Force personnel use of night vision goggles during a contingency.</span></p>

<p><span>2.11.3.4.&nbsp;Operation
JUST CAUSE was the largest and most complex air operation since Vietnam and
involved more than 250 aircraft. American forces eliminated organized
resistance in just 6 days. Manuel Noriega surrendered 3 January 1990 and was
flown to Miami Florida to face trial. Less than a year later, many of the same
Airmen that made Operation JUST CAUSE a resounding success would build and
travel another, larger air bridge during Operation DESERT SHIELD.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.12. Gulf War I (1990):</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.12.1.&nbsp;<b>Persian Gulf War and Subsequent
Operations:</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.12.1.1.&nbsp;The Gulf
War was no surprise to anyone except perhaps Saddam Hussein. After prevailing
in an 8-year war with Iran that was so costly this war nearly led to a military
coup, Saddam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex the small, oil-rich nation
of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. During his occupation of the country, he plundered
it and brutalized the population. The invasion put Iraq, with the fourth
largest Army in the world and an extensive program to develop nuclear weapons,
on the doorstep of Saudi Arabia with vast petroleum reserves. If the Saudis
also fell to Iraq, the dictator would control 50 percent of the world's oil.</span></p>

<p><span>2.12.1.2.&nbsp;The
United States sought and received a United Nations sanction to act against Iraq
and joined 27 other nations to launch Operation DESERT SHIELD, a massive
military buildup in Saudi Arabia near the border of Iraq, aimed first at
deterring Saddam Hussein from aggression against the Saudis and then to prepare
the way for a counter invasion, if necessary. United States President George
Bush demanded the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Saddam
believed that, since Vietnam, the American public lacked the stomach for war.
For more than 6 months he alternated between defiance and vague promises of
compliance.</span></p>

<p><span>2.12.2.&nbsp;<b>Operation DESERT SHIELD and
Operation DESERT STORM, Kuwait and Iraq (1990-1991):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.12.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>By the time President Bush launched Operation DESERT SHIELD, the
United States Air Force and the sister services had moved a considerable
distance toward a unified conventional warfighting capability. The defensive
deployment in itself was an impressive accomplishment. On 8 August 1990, 24
F-15Cs landed in Saudi Arabia after taking off 15 hours earlier from Langley
Air Force Base Virginia, some 8,000 miles away. Within 5 days, C-5 and C-141
airlifters had escorted in five fighter squadrons, an airborne warning and
control system contingent, and an airborne brigade: 301 planes altogether. On
21 August, Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney announced that sufficient force
was in place to defend Saudi Arabia. A month into the crisis, 1,220 Allied
aircraft were in theater and combat ready. When Saddam Hussein missed the final
deadline to withdraw his troops from Kuwait, Operation DESERT STORM began 15
January 1991.</span></p>

<p><span>2.12.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Within the first 24 hours of Desert Storm, the air war</span></p>

<p><span>was essentially won. The
Iraqi air force hardly showed their face. Having established air dominance,
coalition air forces turned their attention to entrenched ground forces,
pounding them into a frightened mass ready to surrender to the first allied
troops they saw. In the final stages of the air war, the Air Force began  tank
plinking,  or destroying Iraqi tanks on the ground one at a time (Figure
2.8).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="273" height="203" src="afh1_files/image142.jpg" ></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><sup><span>Figure 2.8. Loading an

<p><span>2.12.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Maintenance</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>key</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>air campaign success. Air Force historian Dr. Richard Hallion
said,  From the suppliers to the line crews sweating under the desert sun, the
coalition's maintainers worked miracles, enabling ever-higher sortie rates as
the war progressed essentially, a constant surge.  Not all enlisted Airmen
worked on maintenance crews. In addition to traditional enlisted functions,
there were new duties, some of which were quite high tech. Two less known jobs
were electronic emissions collection and analysis, undertaken with electronic
warfare officers and airborne intelligence technicians. Electronic intelligence
was characterized by long hours of work on station and meticulous, patient
review of enemy transmissions, shot through with brief but urgently explosive
moments when life or death information was quickly transmitted to the right
people.</span></p>

<p><span>2.12.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>On 28 February 1991, scarcely 48 hours after the air war ended and
the land invasion took center stage, Iraq surrendered to the coalition. In the
43-day war, the Air Force was, for the first time in modern combat, the equal
partner of land and sea power. The Air Force went into the Gulf talking in cold
war terms about air superiority and sustainable casualties and came out
trumpeting air supremacy with minimum casualties. Within 6 months, 27 September
1991, strategic bomber crews were ordered to stand down from their decades-long
round-the-clock readiness for nuclear war. The Cold War was officially over, a
new world had arrived, and the role of enlisted Airmen changed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.13.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Operations PROVIDE COMFORT and NORTHERN WATCH, Iraq
(1991-2003):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.13.1.&nbsp;When the
American-led international coalition bombed Iraq and drove the forces of Iraq
from Kuwait in 1991, Saddam Hussein's power was weakened. Rebellious Kurds in
northern Iraq, whom Hussein brutally suppressed with chemical weapons 3 years
earlier, launched an uprising in early March 1991. When Iraqi government troops
defeated the rebellion a month later, threatening to repeat the massacres of
the past, more than a million Kurds fled to Iran and Turkey. Hundreds of
thousands more gathered on cold mountain slopes on the Iraqi-Turkish border.
Lacking food, clean water, clothing, blankets, medical supplies, and shelter,
the refugees suffered enormous mortality rates.</span></p>

<p><span>2.13.2.&nbsp;On 3 April
1991, the United Nations Security Council authorized a humanitarian relief
effort for the Iraqi Kurds. During the first week in April, the United States
organized a combined task force for Operation PROVIDE COMFORT. About 600
pallets of relief supplies were delivered per day, but airdrops alone proved
inadequate. Moreover, the operation failed to address the root of the problem.
The refugees could not stay where they were, and Turkey, faced with a restless
Kurdish population of their own, refused to admit them in large numbers. Operation
PROVIDE COMFORT, therefore, evolved into a larger-phased operation for American
ground troops.</span></p>

<p><span>2.13.3.&nbsp;After 1993,
Saddam Hussein rarely challenged coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly
zones, but United States units remained wary. On 14 April 1994, two American
F-15s patrolling the northern no-fly zone accidentally shot down two UH-60
Black Hawk helicopters, killing 26 people, including 15 Americans.
Misidentifying the helicopters as hostile, the F-15 pilots failed to receive
contrary information from either the helicopters or an orbiting E-3 aircraft.
The friendly fire incident aroused negative public opinion and a demand for
changes to prevent such accidents in the future.</span></p>

<p><span>2.13.4.&nbsp;Phase II of
Operation PROVIDE COMFORT ended in December 1996, thanks largely to infighting
among Kurdish factions vying for power. When one Kurdish group accepted Iraqi
backing to drive another from the northern Iraqi city of Irbil, United States
transports participating in Operations QUICK TRANSIT I, II, and III airlifted many
displaced Kurds to safe areas in Turkey. During Operation PACIFIC HAVEN, 7,000
refugees proceeded to Guam for settlement in the United States.</span></p>

<p><span>2.13.5.&nbsp;Operation
NORTHERN WATCH, which began 1 January 1997 with an initial mandate of 6 months,
succeeded Operation PROVIDE COMFORT. Operation NORTHERN WATCH officially ended
17 March 2003, 2 days before Operation IRAQI FREEDOM began.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.14.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Operation SOUTHERN WATCH, Iraq (1992-2003):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.14.1.&nbsp;On
26 August 1992, to discourage renewed Iraqi military activity near Kuwait,
President George H. W. Bush announced a no-fly zone in southern Iraq in support
of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, Operation</span></p>

<p><span>SOUTHERN WATCH.</span></p>

<p><span>2.14.2.&nbsp;The
resolution protected Shiite Muslims under aerial attack from the Iraqi regime of
Saddam Hussein in the aftermath of Operation DESERT STORM and enforced other
United Nations sanctions against Iraq. The Iraqi regime complied with the
restrictions of the no-fly zone until 27 December 1992. F-16s shot down one
Iraqi MiG-25 and chased a second aircraft back across the border.</span></p>

<p><span>2.14.3.&nbsp;Less than a
month later, Air Force aircraft attacked surface-to-air missile sites
threatening coalition aircraft. In June, the United States launched cruise
missile strikes against the Iraq Intelligence Service Headquarters in Baghdad
as retaliation for the planned assassination of former United States President
George Bush during an April 1993 visit to Kuwait.</span></p>

<p><span>2.14.4.&nbsp;In
October 1994, Iraqi troops, including elite Republican Guard units, massed at
the Kuwaiti border. The United States responded with Operation VIGILANT
WARRIOR, the introduction of thousands of additional United States Armed Forces
personnel into the theater. Operation SOUTHERN WATCH became the United States
Air Force test for the Air and Space Expeditionary Force concept in October
1995, when a composite unit designed to replace temporarily a United States
Navy carrier air wing leaving the gulf area arrived to support flying
operations. The Air and Space Expeditionary Force arrived fully armed and began
flying within 12 hours of landing. The Air and Space Expeditionary Force
concept proved sound. Additional Air and Space Expeditionary Forces have since
deployed to support Operation SOUTHERN WATCH.</span></p>



<p><span>2.14.5.&nbsp;In 1997, in
response to Iraqi aggression against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, President
William Clinton expanded the Operation SOUTHERN WATCH no-fly zone to the 33d
parallel, just south of Baghdad. The expansion meant that most of Iraqi
airspace fell into no-fly zones.</span></p>

<p><span>2.14.6.&nbsp;One of the
most important improvements in both flying operations and the quality of life
for members resulted directly from the 1996 bombing at Khobar Towers, Dhahran
Air Base. In the aftermath, the Air Force reviewed their entire security
police, law enforcement, and force protection programs. In 1998, the Air Force
reorganized existing security police units into new security forces groups and
squadrons that trained and specialized in all aspects of force protection,
including terrorist activity and deployed force security. Operation SOUTHERN
WATCH officially ended 26 August 2003.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.15.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operations
PROVIDE RELIEF, IMPRESSIVE LIFT, and RESTORE HOPE Somalia (1992-1994).</span></b></p>

<p><span>In 1992, America's armed forces took part in
several major humanitarian operations across the globe. One of those places was
Somalia. Refer to Chapter 1 Enlisted Heritage paragraph 1.17 for information on
enlisted Airman's involvement with these operations.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.16.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operation
UPHOLD DEMOCRACY, Haiti (1994):</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.16.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The United States decided to intervene in Haiti on 8 September
1994. The United States Atlantic Command developed two different Operation
UPHOLD DEMOCRACY plans: one for forcible entry and the other for passive entry.
United States Air Force planners worked through evolving variations, not knowing
which plan would be implemented. At nearly the last minute, a diplomatic
proposal that former President James (Jimmy) E. Carter offered persuaded the
military leader in Haiti to relinquish control. The unexpected decision caused
a mission change from invasion to insertion of a multinational peacekeeping
force. On 19 September 1994, the Joint Chief of Staff directed execution of the
passive-entry plan. For the Air Force, this meant activating an aerial force of
more than 200 aircraft: transports, special operations, and surveillance
planes.</span></p>

<p><span>2.16.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>United States Air Force participation effectively ended 12 October
1994 when resupply of United States forces became routinely scheduled airlift
missions and deployed aircraft and crews returned home. On 15 October 1994, the
Haitian president returned to his country, the beneficiary of a strong United
States response to an oppressive dictator. As in Panama, the Air Force brought
to bear an overwhelming force of fighters, command and control aircraft,
gunships and other special operations aircraft, reconnaissance airplanes,
aerial refueling tankers, and thousands of troops aboard the airlift fleet of
strategic and tactical aircraft. The successful adaptation to the last-minute
change in mission, from military invasion force to airlifting peacekeeping
troops, was a major indicator of the flexibility airpower offers United States
military and political leaders in fulfilling foreign policy objectives.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.17.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Operation PROVIDE PROMISE, Sarajevo and
Bosnia-Herzegovina (1992-1996):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.17.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>By 1991, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, coupled with the disintegration of the Soviet Union itself,
dissolved the political cement that bound ethnically diverse Yugoslavia into a
single nation. Freed from the threat of external domination, Roman Catholic
Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence from the Yugoslav federation
dominated by Eastern Orthodox Serbia. In early 1992, predominantly Muslim
Bosnia-Herzegovina (Bosnia) also severed ties to the Federation. Fearing their
minority status, armed Serbs within Bosnia began forming their ethnic state by
seizing territory and, in the spring, besieging the Bosnian capital of
Sarajevo.</span></p>

<p><span>2.17.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In April 1992, the United States recognized Bosnia's independence
and began airlifting relief supplies to Sarajevo. On 3 July 1992, the United
States designated operations in support of the United Nations airlift Operation
PROVIDE PROMISE and United States Air Forces in Europe C-130s began delivering
food and medical supplies.</span></p>

<p><span>2.17.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Most United States Air Force missions flew out of Rhein-Main Air
Base in Frankfurt, Germany. C-130s from the 435th and 317th Airlift Wings flew
the initial Operation PROVIDE PROMISE missions, but over the course of the
operation, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and Regular Air Force units
rotated from the United States on 3-week deployments. Although the United
States was only one of at least 15 countries airlifting relief supplies to
Sarajevo, by the end of 1992, United States airplanes had delivered more than
5,400 tons of food and medical supplies.</span></p>

<p><span>2.17.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Inaugurated during the Bush administration, Operation PROVIDE
PROMISE expanded significantly after President Clinton took office. He acted in
response to continued attacks by Bosnian Serbs on Sarajevo and on the relief
aircraft themselves. A secondary mission, Operation PROVIDE SANTA, took place
in December 1993 when C-130s dropped 50 tons of toys and children's clothes and
shoes over Sarajevo. A month later, an Operation PROVIDE PROMISE C-130 was the
first United States Air Force aircraft to suffer damage from the operation when
strucked by an artillery shell at the Sarajevo airport. Despite the fact there
were no injuries and the damage was minor, the United Nations suspended flights
for a week.</span></p>

<p><span>2.17.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>On 14 December 1995, warring factions signed peace accords at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ohio. The last humanitarian air-land delivery
into Sarajevo took place on 4 January 1996. During the 3  year operation,
aircraft supporting the United Nations-relief operation withstood 279 incidents
of ground fire.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.18.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Operation DENY FLIGHT, Bosnia (1993-1995):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.18.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Operation DENY FLIGHT
was an effort to limit the war in Bosnia through imposition of a no-fly zone
over the country. There was only one non-American in the NATO Operation DENY
FLIGHT command chain, although many other nations participated, including the
United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Germany, and Turkey.</span></p>

<p><span>2.18.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Over the first 18 months of Operation DENY FLIGHT, the operation s
mission expanded and aircraft engaged</span></p>

<p><span>United Nations
resolution violators. On 28 February 1994, NATO aircraft scored the first
aerial combat victories in their 45-year history. Two United States Air Force
F-16s from the 526th Fighter Squadron intercepted six Bosnian Serb jets and
shot down four.</span></p>

<p><span>2.18.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Despite NATO actions, Operation DENY FLIGHT did not stop the
Bosnian Serb attacks or effectively limit the war. Bosnian Serbs often took
members of lightly armed United Nations forces hostage to compel NATO to
discontinue airstrikes. In May 1995, Operation DENY FLIGHT aircraft struck a
munitions depot, after which Bosnian Serbs took 370 United Nations soldiers
hostage. The United Nations vetoed further strikes. In June, Bosnian Serbs shot
down a United States Air Force F-16 patrolling over Bosnia.</span></p>

<p><span>2.18.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Operation DELIBERATE FORCE served notice to Bosnian Serb forces
that they would be held accountable for their actions. Airstrikes came not only
against targets around Sarajevo, but also against Bosnian Serb targets
throughout the country. The results were dramatic. Operation DELIBERATE FORCE
marked the first campaign in aerial warfare where precision munitions
outweighed conventional bombs. The incessant air campaign, with only a few days
respite in early September, as well as ground advances by Croatian and other
forces against the Serbs, garnered the desired results. On 14 September, the
Serbs agreed to NATO terms and the bombing stopped.</span></p>

<p><span>2.18.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Operation DELIBERATE FORCE officially ended 21 September 1995 with
the December signing in Paris of peace accords among the warring parties.
Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR, whose mission was to implement the agreements, were
replaced in 1996.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.19.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Operation ALLIED FORCE, Kosovo (1999):</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.19.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The conclusion of Operations DELIBERATE FORCE and DENY FLIGHT did
not mean the end to strife in the region. After revoking the province of
Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, the Serbian government slowly began to oppress the
ethnic Albanian population. That oppression eventually turned to violence and
mass killings, and the international community began to negotiate with Serbian
leaders in the spring of 1998 for a solution acceptable to all parties. The
Serbs, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, considered the matter an internal
one. A final effort to negotiate a settlement began in January 1999 at
Rambouillet, France, but talks broke down following a large offensive against
Albanian civilians in March.</span></p>

<p><span>2.19.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>To prevent a repeat of the  ethnic cleansing  that took place in
Bosnia, on 24 March 1999 NATO forces began flying operations to force Serbia to
accept NATO terms to end the conflict in Kosovo. Named Operation ALLIED FORCE,
NATO leaders hoped a few days of airstrikes to demonstrate NATO's resolve would
force Milosevic to capitulate. That was not the case and took 78 days with more
than 38,000 sorties for NATO to secure their objective.</span></p>

<p><span>2.19.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The primary factor in the conclusion of Operation ALLIED FORCE was
NATO's unity and resolve. NATO was tough and became progressively tougher
throughout the campaign. This lesson was clear to Milosevic, who had hoped he
could outwait NATO. In addition, the precision and the persistence of the air
campaign were fundamental factors in convincing Milosevic to end the fight. The
air campaign started slowly but gathered momentum as the air campaign went on
and became increasingly damaging to Milosevic's entire military infrastructure,
not just the forces in the field in Kosovo, but throughout the entire country.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.20.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Operations NOBLE EAGLE and ENDURING FREEDOM:</b></span></p>

<p><span>2.20.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Four unprecedented acts of violence in three locations spreading
from New York City to western Pennsylvania to Washington, District of Columbia
on 11 September 2001 left thousands dead, thousands more grieving, and a nation
wondering what would happen next. This fanatical hatred carried out by a hidden
handful manifested and exploded, causing two of the world's tallest buildings
to crumble, scarring the nation's military nerve center, and forcing the
President of the United States aboard Air Force One to seek safe haven.
Following the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Air Force community
realized the depth and scope of the hatred. In the days that followed, stories
circulated of service members and civilians pulling comrades from burning
buildings, fighting fires, providing medical attention, and volunteering to do
whatever they could.</span></p>

<p><span>2.20.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The Air Force responded quickly to the attack. The day of the attack,
American fighter aircraft began combat air patrols in the skies of America in
support of Operation NOBLE EAGLE. Six months later, North American Aerospace
Defense Command, with more than 100 Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and
Regular Air Force fighters from 26 locations, continued to monitor American
airspace. More than 80 percent of the pilots flying Operation NOBLE EAGLE
missions belonged to the Air National Guard. Nearly as many Air Force Reserve,
Air National Guard, and active duty members (more than 11,000) deployed to
support Operation NOBLE EAGLE (Figure 2.9) as for the other thrust of the
United States response to the attack, Operation ENDURING FREEDOM.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 2.9. C-17 in

<p><span>2.20.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Operation ENDURING FREEDOM would take</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>the fight</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to the Nation's enemies overseas, most notably
Afghanistan, an impoverished country where the United States focus was twofold:
provide humanitarian airlift to the oppressed people of Afghanistan and conduct
military action to root out terrorists and their supporters. When the Taliban,
Afghanistan's ruling government, refused President George W. Bush's demand that
suspected terrorists be turned over and all terrorist training camps closed,
the President ordered United States forces to the region. Approximately 350
United States aircraft, including B-1 and B-52 bombers, F-15 and F-16 fighters,
special operations aircraft, RQ-1B and RQ-4A unmanned aerial vehicles, and Navy
fighters, deployed to bases near Afghanistan, including some in the former
Soviet Union. On 7 October 2001, following continued Taliban refusal to hand
over suspected terrorists, United States, British, and French aircraft began a
sustained campaign against terrorist targets in Afghanistan.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>2.20.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Working closely with United States special operations troops and
Afghan opposition forces, airpower employed precision weapons to break the
Taliban's will and capacity to resist. Organized resistance began to collapse
in mid-November, and the Taliban abandoned the last major town under their
control, Kandahar, in December 2001. In addition to strike operations, the Air
Force flew humanitarian relief, dropping nearly 2.5 million humanitarian
rations.</span></p>



<p><b><span>2.21.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operation
ANACONDA.</span></b></p>

<p><span>One of the most
crucial joint combat operations in Afghanistan was Operation ANACONDA, designed
and executed to remove the last remaining organized Taliban resistance.&nbsp;</span><span>Operation&nbsp;</span><span>ANACONDA</span><span>, conducted in the
Shahikot Valley of Afghanistan during early March 2002, was a complex battle
fought in rugged mountainous terrain under difficult conditions. The battle
ended as an American victory at the cost of eight United States military
personnel killed and more than 50 wounded. But the difficult early stages of
the battle provide insights for thinking about how to organize, train, and
equip United States forces for future joint expeditionary operations and how to
pursue transformation. Refer back to Chapter 1, Air Force Heritage paragraphs
1.19.4 to 1.19.6 for the enlisted perspective for this operation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.22.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operation
IRAQI FREEDOM:</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.22.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The primary political goal of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM was to
create "a stable Iraq, with their territorial integrity intact and a broad
based government that renounces Weapons of Mass Destruction development and
use, and no longer supports terrorism or threaten their neighbors." Based
on that primary objective, the combined force commander's top three objectives
were to "defeat or compel capitulation of Iraqi forces, neutralize regime
leadership, and neutralize Iraqi theater ballistic missile/ Weapons of Mass
Destruction delivery systems." For some additional information on the
enlisted perspective for this operation refer back to Chapter 1, Air Force
Heritage paragraphs 1.19.7 to 1.19.9.</span></p>

<p><span>2.22.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Meanwhile, British forces took Basra, control of which was
essential to delivering humanitarian aid. American commanders declared Saddam s
regime was no longer in control of Baghdad on 9 April. Before the city fell,
jubilant crowds toppled a 40-foot statue of Saddam. Iraq's science advisor
surrendered to United States forces, the first on the 55 most-wanted leaders
list issued by the coalition.</span></p>

<p><span>2.22.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In a speech delivered on 2 May 2003 aboard the aircraft carrier
USS&nbsp;<i>Abraham Lincoln</i>, President Bush announced victory in Iraq. The
President's announcement was based on an assessment given to him 3 days earlier
by General Tommy Franks, the top United States military commander in the Gulf.
Meanwhile, in a speech delivered by Secretary of the Air Force James G. Roche
on 25 April 2003 to attendees of the Command Chief Master Sergeant Conference
in Gunter Annex, Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama, Secretary Roche assessed how
United States combat air forces performed during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.
Secretary Roche mentioned that in the past month in Iraq, coalition forces
liberated an oppressed people and began the process of rebuilding a very
different tribal and political climate.</span></p>

<p><b><span>2.23. Iraq and Afghanistan:</span></b></p>

<p><span>2.23.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Operation ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan began after the attacks
of September 11, 2001. Small, highlymobile Army, Navy and United States Air
Force special operation forces were inserted deep into the hostile mountains of
Afghanistan to find, capture, and destroy elusive Taliban and Al Qaeda forces.
United States Air Force enlisted personnel played key roles in the attempt to
drive the Taliban out and they were quickly removed from power. But that wasn t
the end of the conflict. Air Force Airmen continued searching for terrorists
hiding in the mountains.</span></p>

<p><span>2.23.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>United States Air Force Airmen remained an essential part of
United States military operations worldwide as Operation ENDURING FREEDOM
continued. They established forward assault landing strips, directed close air
support strikes, and recovered downed and wounded personnel. In Iraq, United
States Air Force Airmen, in joint operations with other United States
unconventional forces, and conducted missions that paralyzed 11 Iraqi divisions
making the land drive to Baghdad less difficult.</span></p>

<p><span>2.23.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>On July 19, 2003, Technical Sergeant Kevin Whalen, a Tactical Air
Control Party Terminal Attack Controller (Figure 2.10), was supporting an
Afghan Military Forces and United States Special Forces combat patrol in the
Gayan Valley, Afghanistan. The patrol was hit in a well-coordinated ambush by a
numerically superior enemy force. Whalen returned effective fire with an
automatic grenade launcher and remained exposed to enemy fire from three
directions while the rest of the team took cover. The grenade launcher was hit six
times, but Whalen remained at his post. While he was trying to fix the
launcher, Whalen was hit three times: one bullet hit his body armor, another
his Gerber tool and the third struck him in the left arm. Whalen dropped out of
the turret and began first aid to stop the bleeding. At the same time, he
recovered his radio and calmly called in close air support. When the engagement
was over, Whalen insisted that all other wounded be evacuated first so he could
keep control of the close air support. After two days in the hospital, he
refused to stay and went back to the team to continue combat missions. For his
actions, Technical Sergeant Whalen was awarded the Silver Star.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>2.23.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The bombing of the Khobar Towers on 25 June, 1996 drove major
changes in how we conduct Basic Military Training. Since that time, the United
States Air Force has placed a strong emphasis on the preparation of our young
airmen for combat. While the intense training has become longer it also has
shifted to include a deployment phase. In 2005 this deployment phase, was
called the BEAST and places the trainees in an environment similar to those
they may experience once they deploy. In addition to tackling the BEAST, and
the massive obstacle courses, other training includes defending and protecting
their base of operations, directing search and recovery, basic selfaid and
buddy care, they begin leadership training. As deployments continue our airmen
are much more prepared in 2012 as a result of lessons learned at Khobar Towers.</span></p>

to Afghanistan March 11, 2004 (Figure 2.11). He was part of an advanced force
operations team and along with elements of the Afghan national strike unit to
capture a high-value target a drug king-pin who was funding terrorism and to
prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons. Colon-Lopez was on an operation
in Afghanistan. Colon-Lopez was on the first of four helicopters, which took
sustained small-arms fire and was seriously damaged as they landed. With rounds
impacting all around him and unsure of the size of the enemy force, he pressed
forward, overrunning enemy positions. His action suppressed enemy fire against
the other three helicopters. Colon-Lopez and the team drove the enemy away. The
raid resulted in two enemy kills, 10 enemy apprehensions and the destruction of
rocket-propelled grenades and small caliber weapons. As a result of this
action, he became one of the first six recipients of the Combat Action medal.
Additionally he received the Bronze Star with Valor for his actions during the
engagement.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>2.23.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Because of budget constraints the United States Air Force reduced
size of the active-duty force in 2007, to roughly 64% of that of the United
States Air Force at the end of the Gulf War in 1991. In 2008 the United States
Air Force went from 360,000 active duty personnel to 330,000 personnel.
Consequently crews flying training hours were also reduced.</span></p>

<p><span>2.23.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In late January 2007, two United States Army Special Forces teams
that included United States Air Force Combat Controllers Technical Sergeant
Bryan Patton and Staff Sergeant David Orvosh responded to help Iraqi police in
Najaf who tried to arrest what they thought were only 30 members of the
fanatical  Soldiers of Heaven  sect. Instead they were ambushed by about 800
heavily-entrenched insurgents. A large battle ensued and Patton and Orvosh
successfully brought in close air support that strafed and bombed the enemy.
More help arrived and was quickly pinned down, which included Combat Controller
Staff Sergeant Ryan Wallace (Figure 2.12). Thanks to Wallace and several others
their actions would turn the tide of the battle. At a key time in the battle,
Wallace called in a 500-lb laser-guided bomb against the enemy position 100
meters away ( danger close ) and killed or stunned the 40 insurgents in the
position. Then, at great risk to their lives Wallace and two others charged the
position and killed the remaining enemy. About 370 insurgents were killed,
mostly by air attack, and more than 400 were captured (including 14 high-value
targets). The destruction of this strongpoint proved to be the turning point in
the battle. The three Combat Controllers' actions were essential to victory in
this battle.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>2.23.8.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The withdrawal of American military forces from Iraq has been a
contentious issue within the United States since the beginning of the Iraq War.
As the war has progressed from the initial 2003 invasion phase to a multi-year
occupation, United States public opinion has turned in favor of troop
withdrawal. In late April 2007, the United States Congress passed a
supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a deadline for troop withdrawal,
but President Bush vetoed this bill soon afterwards. All United States Forces
were mandated to withdraw from Iraqi territory by 31 December 2011 under the
terms of a bilateral agreement signed in 2008 by President Bush. The United
States troop withdrawal from Iraq was completed on 18 December 2011 early
Sunday morning.</span></p>

<p><span>2.23.9.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In March 2013, Technical Sergeant Delorean Sheridan (Figure 2.13.)
was completing a routine pre-brief for a combat control mission at his deployed
location in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. While his team loaded gear into their
vehicles, an Afghan National Police Officer suddenly turned and opened fire
with a truck-mounted machine gun 25 feet away. Simultaneously, 15 to 20
insurgents just outside the village engaged the base with heavy machine
gunfire. With rounds striking and killing his teammates surrounding him,
Technical Sergeant Sheridan closed in on the gunman with a pistol and M-4
Rifle, neutralizing the immediate threat with deadly accuracy. Still under
heavy attack from outside insurgents, Technical Sergeant Sheridan exposed
himself to heavy machine gunfire three more times to drag his wounded teammates
out of the line of fire to a protected casualty collection point. Once his
wounded teammates were pulled to safety, Technical Sergeant Sheridan directed
close air support and surveillance aircraft to pinpoint, engage and eliminate
the additional insurgents. During these efforts, Technical Sergeant Sheridan
also aided in assessing and moving his wounded teammates, while directing the
entrance and exit of six medical evacuation helicopters. Sergeant Sheridan s
calmness and leadership in the face of danger helped saved 23 lives and allowed
for the evacuation of his critically wounded teammates. For these actions,
Technical Sergeant Sheridan was awarded the Silver Star. He also received one
of the Air Force's most prestigious awards, the 2013 Lance P. Sijan United
States Air Force Leadership Award. Lastly he was selected as one of the 12
Outstanding Airmen of the Year for 2014.</span></p>

<p><span>2.23.10.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For most United States and NATO forces, the war in Afghanistan
will be over by the end of 2014. The mission of roughly 300 American airmen
could continue for years after the 12-year-old war is technically over. Those
Airmen are helping stand up the Afghan air force, and their mission is expected
to continue until the Afghan air force becomes fully independent in 2017.
President Obama announced on 19 August 2014 that he planned to withdraw the
last American troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. Under a new timetable
the 32,000 American troops now in Afghanistan would be reduced to 9,800 after
this year (2014). That number would be cut in half by the end of 2015, and by
the end of 2016, there would be only a vestigial force to protect the embassy
in Kabul and to help the Afghans with military purchases and other security
matters. At the height of American involvement, in 2011, the United States had
101,000 troops in the country. Besides carrying out operations against the
remnants of Al Qaeda, the troops that stay behind will train Afghan security
forces. But from 2015 onward, they will be quartered at Bagram Airfield and in
Kabul, the capital. While they will be supplemented by NATO troops, alliance
members should follow America's lead in pulling out by the end of 2016. The shift
in focus is from Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan to Al Qaeda threats that
have sprung up fro</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/world/middleeast/syrian-rebels-tied-to-al-qaeda-play-key-role-in-war.html"><span>m Syria</span></a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/world/middleeast/syrian-rebels-tied-to-al-qaeda-play-key-role-in-war.html"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>to&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/world/africa/nigerias-army-holding-up-hunt-for-taken-girls.html"><span>Nigeria</span></a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/24/world/africa/nigerias-army-holding-up-hunt-for-taken-girls.html"><span>.</span></a><span>&nbsp;We will go from the United States-led

<p><b><span>2.24. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>From the skies over the
Rio Grande to those over Iraq and Afghanistan nearly 100 years later, air power
has evolved from an ineffective oddity to the dominant form of military might
in the world. The applications and effectiveness have increased with each succeeding
conflict; in World War I air power played a minor role, and in Kosovo the only
role. This chapter looked at the development of air power through the nation s
many conflicts and just a few of the many contributions of enlisted personnel.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Chapter 3</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>ORGANIZATION</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 3A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>3.1.</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Armed Forces of the
United States are not separate and independent parts of the government; rather,
they compose one of the instruments of national policy. Since the birth of the
Nation, policies and directives have been made by civilians assigned to the
military and to the executive and legislative branches of the government.
Military leaders do not make national military policy decisions. Civilian
leadership is a key concept in the military organization, beginning with the
President's role as Commander in Chief. This chapter begins with a discussion
of the President's role. The chapter highlights the structure of the Department
of Defense and defines the roles of the military departments, Joint Chiefs of
Staff, unified combatant commands, and combined commands. Finally, this chapter
emphasizes the key elements of the Department of the Air Force, focuses on
force structure and major commands, and includes a discussion about the
structure and functions of the various lower levels of command and Air Reserve
Components.&nbsp;<b><i>Section 3B Command Authority and Department of Defense</i></b></span></p>

<p><b><span>3.2.</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Commander
in Chief.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The United States
Constitution establishes the basic principle of civilian control of the Armed
Forces. As Commander in Chief, the President has final command authority.
However, as head of the executive branch, he is subject to the checks and
balances system of the legislative and judicial branches.</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.3.</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Department
of Defense.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Established by the
National Security Act of 1947, the Department of Defense's function is to
maintain and employ Armed Forces. The Department of Defense includes the Office
of the Secretary of Defense; the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Joint Staff; and
the Departments of the Army, Navy (including the United States Marine Corps),
and Air Force. Furthermore, the Department of Defense includes the unified
combatant commands and forces dedicated to combined commands, defense agencies,
and Department of Defense field activities. As the civilian head of the
Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense reports directly to the
President.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.4.</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Secretary
of Defense.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
President appoints the Secretary of Defense with the advice and consent of the
Senate. The Secretary of Defense serves as principal defense policy advisor to
the President and is responsible for the formulation of general defense policy,
policy related to all matters of direct and primary concern to the Department
of Defense, and for the execution of approved policy. The operational chain of
command runs from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the combatant
commanders. A specific responsibility of the Secretary of Defense is providing
written policy guidance for Department of Defense component chief's use to
prepare and review program recommendations and budget proposals. The
Secretary's guidance includes national security objectives and policies,
military mission priorities, and the projected levels for available resources.
The Secretary of Defense also provides the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff with
written policy guidance to prepare and review contingency plans. The
Secretaries of the military departments and the commanders of the combatant
commands are provided written guidelines to direct the effective detection and
monitoring of all potential aerial and maritime threats to the national
security of the United States.</span></p>

<p><span>3.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>The Armed Forces Policy Council.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Armed Forces Policy
Council<i>&nbsp;</i>assists in matters requiring a long-range view and in
formulating broad defense policy. The council advises the Secretary of Defense
on matters of broad policy and reports on other matters as requested. The
council consists of the Secretary of Defense (Chairman); the Deputy Secretary
of Defense; Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff; Under Secretaries of Defense for Policy and for Acquisition,
Technology, and Logistics; the Deputy under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Technology; and the four service chiefs. Sometimes other departments
and agencies in the executive branch are invited to attend specific meetings.</span></p>

<p><span>3.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Under Secretaries of Defense.</span></b></p>

<p><span>There are five Under
Secretaries of Defense (Policy; Comptroller; Personnel and Readiness;
Acquisition, Technology and Logistics; and Intelligence) who assist the
Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense receives staff assistance
through a number of special agencies, such as the Defense Threat Reduction
Agency, Security Service, and Defense Logistics Agency, which provide special
skills, expertise, and advice.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.5. Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Appointed by the
President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, the Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff is selected from the officers of the regular components
of the Armed Forces. The Chairman, while so serving, holds the grade of general
or, in the case of the Navy, holds the grade of admiral, and outranks all other
officers of the Armed Forces. However, the Chairman may not exercise military
command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of the Armed Forces. The
operational chain of command runs from the President to the Secretary of
Defense to the combatant commanders. However, a provision of the
Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 permits the
President to authorize communications through the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Consequently,&nbsp;DoDD&nbsp;5100.01,&nbsp;<i>Functions of the
Department of Defense and Its Major Components,</i>&nbsp;places the Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff in the communications chain of command. The Chairman,
Joint Chiefs of Staff is the principal military advisor to the President, the
National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. Further, the Secretary
of Defense may assign responsibility for overseeing the activities of the
combatant commands to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.</span></p>

<p><span>3.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Vice Chairman,
appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
is a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and performs such duties as
prescribed by the Chairman, with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. The
Vice Chairman cannot be from the same Uniformed Service as the Chairman, and
serves a tour of 2 years and may be reappointed for two additional terms. The
Vice Chairman serves as the Acting Chairman in the absence, vacancy or
disability of the Chairman.</span></p>

<p><span>3.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman</span></b><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Senior Enlisted Advisor
to the Chairman (SEAC) is a military position within the United States
Department of Defense and is designated the senior noncommissioned officer in
the United States Armed Forces. The SEAC is appointed by the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) to serve as an advisor to the Chairman and the
Secretary of Defense on all matters involving joint and combined total force
integration, utilization, health of the force, and joint development for
enlisted personnel. The SEAC also serves as a spokesperson to leaders and
organizations on applicable issues affecting the total enlisted force</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.6. Joint Chiefs of Staff:</span></b></p>

<p><span>3.6.1.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the President
and the Secretary of Defense, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff serve as
advisors to the President, Secretary of Defense, and the National Security
Council. They provide the strategic direction of the Armed Forces. They review
major materiel and personnel requirements of the Armed Forces according to
strategic and logistic requirements and establish joint doctrine. Members of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff are also responsible for the assignment of logistic
responsibilities to the military services, formulation of policies for joint
training, and coordination of military education.</span></p>

<p><span>3.6.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff; Vice Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff; Chief of Staff, United
States Army; Chief of Naval Operations; Chief of Staff, United States Air
Force; Commandant of the Marine Corps; and Chief of the National Guard Bureau.
The Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff presides over the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
furnishes the recommendations and views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the
President, National Security Council, or the Secretary of Defense. Other
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may also provide advice to these bodies,
when requested. If a member disagrees with an opinion of the Chairman, Joint
Chiefs of Staff, the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff must present this advice
in addition to his or her own. For the service chiefs (United States Army,
Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, Commandant
of the Marine Corps), their Joint Chiefs of Staff duties take precedence over
all other duties. Consequently, as the military heads of their respective
services, Joint Chiefs of Staff members delegate many duties to their vice
chiefs of staff while retaining overall responsibility.</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.7.</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Joint
Staff.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Joint Staff assists members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in carrying out their
assigned responsibilities of strategic direction, unified operation of combatant
commands, and the integration of all land, naval, and air forces into an
efficient force. By law, the direction of the Joint Staff rests exclusively
with the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Chairman normally manages the
Joint Staff through the Director of the Joint Staff. The Director of the Joint
Staff is selected by the Chairman, after consultation with other members of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and with the approval of the Secretary of Defense. The
staff's more than 1,500 military and civilian personnel are composed of
approximately equal numbers of officers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
Marines make up about 20 percent of the number allocated to the Navy.&nbsp; The
Joint Staff is prohibited from functioning as a General Staff, and has no executive
authority.</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.8.</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>Unified
Combatant Commands and Combined Commands:</span></b></p>

<p><span>3.8.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Unified
Combatant Commands.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The President, assisted
by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff through the Secretary of Defense,
establishes unified combatant commands for the performance of military
missions. The Secretary of Defense assigns military missions through the
Unified Command Plan. A unified combatant command has a broad, continuing
mission and is composed of forces from two or more military departments. The
combatant commander deploys, directs, controls, and coordinates the action of
the command's forces; conducts joint training exercises; and controls certain
support functions. Combatant commanders are responsible to both the Secretary
of Defense and the President. Unified combatant commands are organized
geographically or functionally. Geographic unified combatant commands include
the United States European Command, United States Pacific Command, United
States Northern Command, United States Southern Command, and the United States
Central Command.&nbsp; Functional Unified Combatant Commands include the United
States Special Operations Command, United States Transportation Command, and
United States Strategic Command. Once assigned to a unified combatant command
by the Secretary of Defense, a force cannot be transferred except by authority
of the Secretary of Defense or under special procedures of the Secretary of
Defense office with the approval of the President. All units assigned to a
unified combatant command remain under the combatant command authority of the
unified combatant command commander and the administrative control authority of
the respective Service Component Commander.</span></p>

<p><span>3.8.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Combined
Commands.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Combined commands
consist of forces from more than one allied nation. Since combined commands are
binational or multinational, their missions and responsibilities (including
command responsibilities) must establish, assign, and conform to binational and
multinational agreements. Normally a combined command operates under the terms
of a treaty, alliance, or bilateral agreement between or among the nations
concerned. The North American Aerospace Defense Command, Combined Forces
Command Korea, and Allied Command Operations are examples of multinational
commands.</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.9. Military Departments.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The military departments
consist of the Army, Navy (including the Marine Corps and, in wartime, the
Coast Guard), and the Air Force. The Service Secretaries are responsible for
providing efficiently organized, trained, and equipped forces to the combatant
commanders. Although operational command of the forces rests with the combatant
commanders under the direction of the Secretary of Defense, the Service
Secretaries assist the Secretary of Defense in managing the administrative,
training, and logistic functions of the military departments. Except in
operational matters, the Secretary of Defense can issue orders to a Service
through their Secretary. Each Service develops and trains their forces to
perform functions that support the efforts of other Services to accomplish the
overall military objectives. The military departments share general and
specific functions as outlined below, and the Air Force has primary functions
designed to support the general and specific functions of the military
departments.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.1.<b>&nbsp;General Functions.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The traditional roles
and mission of each branch of Service are commonly referred to as functions.
Besides specific combat roles, they furnish operational forces to unified
commands. The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff established
the functions of each branch of the Armed Forces in the Key West Agreement of
1948. The Key West Agreement was revised in 1953 and again in 1958. The general
functions of the Armed Forces are to:</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Support and defend the United States Constitution against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Ensure, by timely and effective military action, the security of
the United States, its possessions, and areas vital to its interests.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Uphold and advance the national policies and interests of the
United States.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.2.&nbsp;<b>Specific Functions.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Along with general
functions, military departments also have some specific functions they share.
These include, but are not limited to:</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Preparing forces and establishing reserves of personnel,
equipment, and supplies for effective prosecution of war and military
operations short of war, and planning for the expansion of peacetime components
to meet the needs of war.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Maintaining, in readiness, mobile reserve forces properly
organized, trained, and equipped for deployment in an emergency.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Preparing and submitting to the Secretary of Defense budgets for
their respective departments, and justifying (before Congress) budget requests
as approved by the Secretary of Defense.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Administering the funds made available for maintaining, equipping,
and training the forces of their respective departments, including those
assigned to unified commands.</span></p>

<p><span>3.9.2.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Assisting each other in accomplishing their respective functions,
including the provision of personnel, intelligence, training, facilities,
equipment, supplies, and services.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="144" height="144" src="afh1_files/image148.jpg" ></span></p>

<p><span>The National Guard
Bureau is a joint activity of the Department of Defense, located in the
Pentagon. The Air National Guard is one of the seven Reserve components of the
United States Armed Forces that augment the active components in the
performance of their missions.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;The Air National Guard is
not a major command, but is a component of the Total Force in offensive,
defensive, and relief operations.</span></p>

<p><span>3.16.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mission.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air National Guard
has both a federal and state mission. The dual mission, a provision of the
United States Constitution, results in each guardsman holding membership in the
National Guard of his or her state and in the National Guard of the United
States.</span></p>

<p><span>3.16.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Federal Mission.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air National Guard's
federal mission is to maintain well-trained, well-equipped units available for
prompt mobilization during war and provide assistance during national
emergencies (such as natural disasters or civil disturbances). During
peacetime, the combat-ready units and support units are assigned to most Air
Force major commands to carry out missions compatible with training,
mobilization readiness, humanitarian and contingency operations such as
Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.</span></p>

<p><span>3.16.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>State Mission.</span></b></p>

<p><span>When Air National Guard
units are not mobilized or under federal control, they report to the governor
of their respective state, territory (Puerto Rico, Guam, Virgin Islands) or the
commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard. Each of the 54
National Guard organizations is supervised by the adjutant general of the state
or territory. Under state law, the Air National Guard provides protection of
life, property and preserves peace, order and public safety. These missions are
accomplished through emergency relief support during natural disasters such as
floods, earthquakes and forest fires; search and rescue operations; support to
civil defense authorities; maintenance of vital public services and counterdrug
operations.</span></p>

<p><span>3.16.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Force Structure.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The primary sources of
full-time support for Air National Guard units are the dual-status military
technician and Active Guard and Reserve personnel. These people perform
day-to-day organization, administration, recruitment, instruction, training and
maintenance support to the unit. By law, dual-status military technicians are
civil service employees of the federal government who must be military members
of the unit that employs them. Technicians train with the unit and are
mobilized with the unit when federalized. Active Guard and Reserve serve under
the command authority of their respective state or territorial governors until
mobilized for federal duty. The Air National Guard has more than 105,000
officers and enlisted people who serve in 90 flying units and 579 mission
support units.</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.17. Field Units.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Department of the
Air Force field units includes major commands, field operating agencies, and
direct reporting units.</span></p>

<p><span>3.17.1.<b>&nbsp;Major Commands.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force is
organized functionally in the United States and geographically overseas. A
major command represents a major Air Force subdivision having a specific
portion of the Air Force mission. Each major command is directly subordinate to
headquarters United States Air Force. Major commands are interrelated and complementary,
providing offensive, defensive, and support elements. An operational command
consists (in whole or in part) of strategic, tactical, space, or defense
forces, or of flying forces that directly support such forces. A support
command may provide supplies, weapon systems, support systems, operational
support equipment, combat material, maintenance, surface transportation,
education and training, or special services and other supported organizations.

equips and maintains combat-ready forces for rapid deployment and employment
while ensuring strategic air defense forces are ready to meet the challenges of
peacetime air sovereignty and wartime air defense. Additionally, ACC develops
strategy, doctrine, concepts, tactics, and procedures for air and space-power
employment. The command provides conventional and information warfare forces to
all unified commands to ensure air, space and information superiority for
warfighters and national decision-makers. The command can also be called upon
to assist national agencies with intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
capabilities. ACC numbered Air Forces provide the air component to United
States Central, Southern and Northern Commands. ACC also augments forces to

<p><span>3.17.1.10.<b>&nbsp;Air
Force Reserve Command (AFRC).</b>&nbsp;Air Force Reserve Command, headquartered
at Robins Air Force Base Georgia, became an Air Force major command on 17
February 1997. Previously, the AFRC was a Field Operating Agency.</span></p>

<p><span>3.17.1.10.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mission.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The mission of
AFRC is to provide combat-ready forces to fly, fight and win in defense of the
United States and its interests.</span></p>

<p><span>3.17.1.10.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Personnel and Resources.&nbsp;</span></b><span>AFRC has nearly 70,000 officer and enlisted personnel, over 4,000
civilian personnel, and 323 aircraft assigned to accomplish its diverse
missions. AFRC is organized into three numbered Air Forces: 4th, 10th, and 22d.
Together these numbered Air Forces lead the activities of 35 flying wings; 10
independent groups. In addition, there are various mission support units
located at 9 Reserve bases, 57 Regular Air Force, Joint Reserve and Air
National Guard bases, as well as miscellaneous locations and ranges.</span></p>

<p><span>3.17.1.10.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Organization.</span></b><span>&nbsp;AFRC
has several mission support groups that provide a wide range of services,
including medical and aeromedical evacuation, aerial port, civil engineer,
security forces, intelligence, communications, mobility support, logistics and
transportation operations.</span></p>

<p><span>3.17.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Field Operating Agencies.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Field operating agencies
are subdivisions of the Air Force directly subordinate to a Headquarters Air
Force functional manager. A field operating agency performs field activities
beyond the scope of the major commands. The activities are specialized or
associated with an Air Force-wide mission and do not include functions
performed in management headquarters (such as Headquarters AMC), unless
specifically directed by a Department of Defense authority. Two examples are
the Air Force Personnel Center under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower,
Personnel, and Services, and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
under the Inspector General. Similar organizations at major command level are
called major command field operating agencies.</span></p>

<p><span>3.17.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Direct Reporting Units.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Direct reporting units
are Air Force subdivisions directly subordinate to the Chief of Staff, Air
Force. A direct reporting unit performs a mission that does not fit into any of
the major commands. A direct reporting unit has many of the same administrative
and organizational responsibilities as a major command. Two examples are the
Air Force District of Washington and the United States Air Force Academy.</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.18. Lower Levels of Command.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Below major commands are
several levels of command. The Air Force component numbered Air Forces and
numbered Air Forces administratively report directly to the major command.
Wings, groups, squadrons, and flights report to either a component numbered Air
Force or a numbered Air Force, whichever is appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Air Force Component Numbered Air Forces.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force currently
has ten Air Force component numbered Air Forces dedicated, to supporting the
unified/sub-unified combatant command and joint task force commanders. These
component numbered Air Forces (nicknamed warfighting headquarters), when
established, are the primary operational-level warfighting component commands.
The component numbered Air Forces headquarters normally consists of an Air
Force forces staff and an assigned air and space operations center or operations
center. They are dedicated to supporting the unified combatant commander and
subordinate joint force commanders across the full range of military
operations. The component numbered Air Force commander supporting a geographic
combatant command will normally be prepared to assume responsibilities as the
joint force air component commander for joint military operations in his or her
respective area of operations, and command a joint task force as required.
Component numbered Air Forces include 1</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air
Force North), 3</span><sup><span>d</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air Force Europe), 7</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air Force Korea), 8</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air Force Strategic Command's Task Force 204),
United States Air Forces Central Command, 11</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force, 12</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air Forces Southern), 14</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air Forces Strategic), 18</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air Forces Transportation) and 24</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Air Force (Air Forces Cyber). Note: The parenthetical in the
name of a component numbered Air Force indicates the combatant command to which
they are assigned.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Numbered
Air Force.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The numbered Air Force
is an administrative level of command directly under a major command. Numbered
Air Forces provide intermediate level operational leadership and supervision.
They do not have complete functional staffs. In non-component numbered Air
Forces, the number of personnel assigned varies but should not exceed 99
manpower authorizations without an approved waiver from Headquarters Air
Force/A1M. A numbered Air Force is assigned subordinate units, such as wings,
groups, and squadrons.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Wing.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The wing is a level of
command below the numbered Air Force and has a distinct mission with
significant scope. A wing is responsible for maintaining the installation and
may have several squadrons in more than one dependent group. The different
types of wings are operational, air base, or specialized mission. Wings will
have a minimum adjusted population of at least 1,000 (750 for Air National
Guard and Air Force Reserve Command wings). This will include manpower
authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor workforces. See Figure
3.1 for a common wing structure.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operational Wing.</span></b><span>&nbsp;An operational wing is one that has an operations group and
related operational mission activity assigned. When an operational wing performs
the primary mission of the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In
addition, an operational wing is capable of self-support in functional areas
such as maintenance and munitions, as needed. When an operational wing is a
tenant organization, the host command provides it with varying degrees of base
and logistics support.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Air Base Wing.</span></b><span>&nbsp;An
air base wing performs a support function rather than an operational mission.
This type of wing maintains and operates a base. An air base wing often
provides functional support to a major commands headquarters.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.3.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Specialized Mission Wing.</span></b><span>&nbsp;A specialized mission wing performs a specialized mission
and usually does not have aircraft or missiles assigned. Examples include
intelligence wings, training wings, and so on. This wing is either a host or a
tenant wing, depending on whether it maintains and operates the base.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.4.&nbsp;<b>Group.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A group is a level of
command below the wing. Like the numbered Air Force, a group is a tactical
echelon with minimal staff support. A group usually has two or more subordinate
units. A dependent group is a mission, logistics, support, medical, or large
functional unit, such as a civil engineer group. Such groups may possess small
supporting staff elements that are organized as sections, such as
standardization and evaluation or quality control. An independent group has the
same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size
do not warrant wing-level designation. Groups will have a minimum adjusted
population of at least 400 (200 for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
Command groups). This includes manpower authorizations, students, and a
percentage of contractor workforces.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 3.1. Wing Organization.</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="566" height="428" src="afh1_files/image160.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>3.18.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Squadron.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
squadron is the basic unit in the Air Force. The different types of squadrons
are either a mission unit, such as an operational flying squadron, or a
functional unit, such as a civil engineer, security forces, or logistics
readiness squadron. Squadrons vary in size according to responsibility.
Squadrons will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 35. This includes
manpower authorizations, students, and a percentage of contractor workforces.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Flight.</span></b></p>

<p><span>If internal subdivision
is required, a flight may consist of sections, then elements. The different
types of flights are numbered/named, alpha, or functional.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.6.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Numbered/Named Flight.</span></b><span>&nbsp;This is the lowest level unit in the Air Force. A numbered
or named flight primarily incorporates smaller elements into an organized unit.
The administrative characteristics for this type of flight include, strength
reporting, like those of a squadron.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.6.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Alpha Flight.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Alpha
flights are part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and composed of several
elements that perform identical missions. Because an alpha flight is not a
unit, this type of a flight is not subject to unit reporting.</span></p>

<p><span>3.18.6.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Functional Flight.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Functional flights are usually part of a squadron and
composed of elements that perform specific missions. Because a functional
flight is not a unit, this type of a flight is not subject to unit reporting.</span></p>

<p><b><span>3.19. Air Reserve Component:</span></b></p>

<p><span>3.19.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Components.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air National Guard
and Air Force Reserve form a significant part of our aerospace capability.
Together they are called the Air Reserve Component. Forces are drawn from the
Air Reserve Component when circumstances require the active force to rapidly
expand. AFPD 10-3,&nbsp;<i>Air Reserve Component Forces,&nbsp;</i>establishes
policy to fully integrate the Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and active
Air Force into a single Total Force.</span></p>

<p><span>3.19.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Staffing and Equipping.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Reserve Component
forces are staffed and trained to meet the same training standards and
readiness levels as active component forces and are supplied with the same
equipment on an equal priority. The active force can only withdraw, divert, or
reassign equipment for other commitments with the Secretary of Defense s
written approval. To ensure responsiveness and combat readiness, Air Reserve
Component forces are continuously evaluated and modernized.</span></p>

<p><span>3.19.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Use.</span></b></p>

<p><span>AFPD 10-3 states, under
the Total Force policy established by Department of Defense in 1973, that both
regular and reserve assets are considered parts of a single United States
military resource. All aspects of regular and reserve forces are considered
when determining an appropriate force mix. Significant factors include
contribution of forces to national security; availability of forces in view of
time, statutory or regulatory constraints; and the cost to equip and maintain
forces. Considerations unique to Air National Guard units include their dual
state and federal missions.</span></p>

<p><span>3.19.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Organization.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air National Guard and
Air Force Reserve unit organization parallels similar Regular Air Force units
with one exception: Air Reserve Component units are sometimes separated to take
advantage of state or regional demographics and are not centralized at
major,&nbsp;multisquadron&nbsp;bases, as is the case with Regular Air Force resources.
This exception is beneficial because it implements a strong relationship with
the civilian community and builds public support for the Air Force as a whole.</span></p>

<p><span>3.19.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Jurisdiction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Command jurisdiction
for&nbsp;nonmobilized&nbsp;Air National Guard units is vested in the governor
of the state, commonwealth, or possession, or in the President, who in essence
is the governor of the District of Columbia. The President delegates authority
to the Secretary of the Army to carry out the powers of the President as
 governor  of the District of Columbia. Command of&nbsp;nonmobilized&nbsp;Air
Force Reserve units is exercised through the Commander, Air Force Reserve
Command, who, in turn, is responsible to the Chief of Staff, Air Force. Command
of&nbsp;nonmobilized&nbsp;Air Force Reserve individual mobilization&nbsp;augmentees&nbsp;is
exercised concurrently through Air Force Reserve Command and the unit of
attachment. Whenever the President authorizes mobilization, the Secretary of
Defense delegates authority to the Services who order Air National Guard and
Air Force Reserve forces to active duty. When activated, operational command of
Air Reserve Component forces transfers to the major command commander who is
also responsible for establishing training resources for all assigned or
attached Air Reserve Component forces.</span></p>

<p><span>The Civil Air Patrol is
a congressionally chartered, non-profit corporation for the public good that
may be utilized as a civilian volunteer auxiliary of the Air Force.&nbsp; The
Secretary of the Air Force can employ the services of CAP in lieu of or to
supplement Air Force resources to fulfill the non-combat programs and missions
of the Air Force.&nbsp; As a partner in the Total Force, when approved and
assigned by the Air Force, CAP conducts missions as Airmen of the AFAUX.</span></p>

<p><span>3.20.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mission.</span></b><span>&nbsp;CAP conducts three
primary programs: Emergency Services and Civil Support, Aerospace Education,

to assist federal, state, local agencies, and non-governmental organizations
during routine and emergency situations. Such services may include, but are not
limited to, Air Force-assigned missions in support of homeland security
operations, consequence management, search and rescue, and other civil support.
CAP aerospace education programs provide educational materials for both senior
and cadet members and the general public.&nbsp; The Cadet Programs' focus is to
motivate American youth to become responsible citizens through aviation-centered
activities.</span></p>

<p><span>3.20.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Personnel and Resources.</span></b><span>&nbsp; CAP has over 55,000 senior member and cadet volunteers
throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. CAP maintains
a fleet of over 500 aircraft, comprised mostly of Cessna 172, 182, and 206; and
GA-8 high-wing, single-engine light aircraft. These aircraft are well suited
for flying associated with aerial assessment, low-level route surveys, fighter
intercept training, courier operations, and search and rescue. CAP maintains a
fleet of over 900 vehicles of passenger vans, sedans, and pick-up trucks suited
for light transportation of personnel and equipment, mobile communications
units, and ground damage assessment. Most vehicles are equipped with radios
able to communicate with CAP aircraft and other&nbsp;groundbased&nbsp;CAP
stations. CAP maintains a nationwide communications capability including high
frequency, very high frequency-AM, and very high frequency-FM fixed, mobile,
and repeater systems. Finally, CAP maintains a&nbsp;stateof-the-art cell phone
forensics cell at its National Operations Center that assists with search and
rescue operations.</span></p>

<p><span>3.20.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Organization.</span></b><span>&nbsp;CAP
is a non-profit corporation under Title 36 of United States Code, and the
official Air Force Auxiliary under Title 10 of United States Code. CAP is
governed by an 11-member Board of Governors.&nbsp; As a non-profit corporation,
CAP is organized under a Chief Executive Officer and national staff. As the Air
Force Auxiliary, the Chief Executive Officer serves as the National Commander.
CAP is organized into eight geographic regions, each led by a regional
commander, and 52 state-level wings (in each state, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico / U.S. Virgin Islands). Approximately 1,500 total individual
units comprise the&nbsp;lowerlevel&nbsp;echelons of CAP within the state-level
wings. The Air Force Auxiliary is aligned under Air Combat Command for fiscal
and operational oversight and utilization.</span></p>

the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, (2)
engage in maritime air surveillance or interdiction to enforce or assist in the
enforcement of the laws of the United States, (3) administer laws and promulgate
and enforce regulations for the promotion of safety of life and property on and
under the high seas and waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States, covering all matters not specifically delegated by law to some other
executive department, (4) develop, establish, maintain, and operate, with due
regard to the requirements of national defense, aids to maritime navigation,
icebreaking facilities, and rescue facilities for the promotion of safety on,

<p><b><span>3.27. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Organized with civilian
leadership throughout, the Armed Forces of the United States are not separate
and independent parts of the government but serve as instruments of national
policy. This chapter began with a discussion of the President's role as
Commander in Chief and continued with the Department of Defense, Joint Chief of
Staff, unified combatant commands, and combined commands. In addition, this
chapter contained information on the Department of the Air Force and focused on
force structure and major commands. Finally, the chapter included a discussion
of the structure and functions of the various lower levels of command and Air
Reserve components.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>AIR FORCE DOCTRINE, AIR EXPEDITIONARY
FORCE (AEF), AND JOINT FORCE</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 4A</span></i></b><b><span> <i>Overview</i></span></b></p>

<p><b><span>4.1. Introduction:&nbsp;</span></b><span>4.1.1. America's Air Force faces significant
challenges. We have been engaged in combat while transforming into a smaller,
leaner, and more capable force. Fiscal constraints combined with operational
challenges and a dynamic international security environment translate into
risks we continue to manage and mitigate in order to provide capabilities
America needs. The Air Force continues to fight the war on terrorism and prepares
to face new threats and conflicts of the future. In order to remain dominant,
we must maintain our airpower advantages over potential adversaries. Modern
warfare is changing. This is not new for America's Airmen, whose heritage spans
and embraces change and whose culture embodies courage and innovation.</span></p>

<p><span>4.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Meeting the challenges in this rapidly changing world requires we
understand and apply Air Force doctrine. Airmen may not have understood or
consistently applied doctrine. The complexity of integrating fighting elements
according to joint, Air Force and multinational doctrine and the uncertainty
inherent in rapidly developing contingency operations demand that planning and
employment be understood and repeatable. We must learn and practice our own doctrine.
We know how to do it right; we have taken the time to research, write it down,
and publish it. We must understand what it means to be an Airman, and we must
be able to articulate what air power can bring to the joint fight. Volume
1,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Basic Doctrine,</i>&nbsp;is the Air Force's premier
statement of our beliefs, and the cornerstone upon which our service identity
is based. Air Force Doctrine is developed by the LeMay Center for Doctrine
Development and Education at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Air Force
doctrine is web-based, and is available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/"><span>https://doctrine.af.mil/</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><span>4.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Air Force forces are presented to a joint force commander as an
air expeditionary task force, or may be composed of the air component to the
joint task force or combatant commander (CCDR) as the C-Numbered Air Force or
CMajor Command. The AEF is the Air Force methodology to provide Air Force
forces and support on a rotational, predictable basis. Three principles are the
foundation upon which the AEF is structured and executed: transparency,
predictability, and equitability. Transparency is the sense that there is no
mystery to the process; when, why, and how should be visible and understandable
by every Airman. Every Air Force member is responsible for knowing and
understanding the AEF original structure, how we deploy today's AEF, and our
goals for the future. By aligning forces in AEF bands and utilizing the teaming
concept our Air Force is able to determine who goes first, defines our battle
rhythm, and provides a logically organized structure during surge periods to
support CCDRs. The AEF is merely a vehicle for managing and scheduling Air
Force forces for expeditionary purposes; it is not a warfighting organization.
The Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) is normally the warfighting
organization attached to the JFC.</span></p>

<p><span>4.1.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Joint warfare is team warfare. Over time, the American experience
in war increasingly demanded cooperation, coordination, and integration of all
U.S. military Services. Today, joint operations are routine and, thus,
routinely practiced. Effectively integrated joint forces are able to rapidly
and efficiently identify and engage adversary weak points and vulnerabilities,
without exposing their own weak points or seams, to ensure mission
accomplishment. Whether there are years to prepare and plan (as in the World
War II Normandy invasion), months (as in Operation DESERT STORM), or only a few
weeks (as in Operation ENDURING FREEDOM), American armed forces must always be
ready to operate in smoothly functioning, joint teams.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 4B</span></i></b><b><span> <i>Air Force Doctrine</i></span></b></p>

<p><b><span>4.2. Uses of Doctrine.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>One way to explore good
doctrine is to use a  compare and contrast  model to walk through some key
issues. This technique also amplifies the point that doctrine should be written
broadly, allowing decision makers latitude in interpretation and flexibility in
application, yet be specific enough to provide informed guidance. This
technique also illustrates the use of doctrine in explaining contentious issues
and how doctrine can be used to think more effectively about the best means to
integrate various aspects of military power and organization. In the following
discussion, there may be overlap among some of the principles expressed; this
is desirable in that often there are different aspects or nuances to a
particular issue. In doctrine, language is important. Finally, the following
discussion presents an Air Force perspective; not all Services may entirely
agree with these points.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Reference:
Volume 1&nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span> &nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>)</span></a></p>

<p><span>4.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b><i>warfighting</i></b>, not&nbsp;<b><i>physics</i></b>.
This principle specifically addresses the perceived differences between
operations in air, space, and cyberspace. Air, space, and cyberspace are
separate domains requiring exploitation of different sets of physical laws to
operate in, but are linked by the effects they can produce together. To achieve
a common purpose, air, space, and cyberspace capabilities need to be
integrated. Therefore, Air Force doctrine focuses on the best means to obtain
warfighting effects regardless of the medium in which a platform operates. As
an example, Airmen should be concerned with the best means of employing
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, not whether a
particular intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform is airborne
or in orbit. This is requisite to achieving true integration across any given
collection of forces.</span></p>

<p><span>4.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b><i>effects</i></b>, not&nbsp;<b><i>platforms</i></b>.
This focuses on the desired outcome of a particular action, not on the system
or weapon itself that provides the effect. For example, doctrine states that
Airmen should seek to achieve air superiority, but doctrine does not focus on
which platforms should be used to achieve that effect. A parallel example of
this is seen in the recognition that bombers are not  strategic,  nor are
fighters  tactical.  Similarly, it does not matter if an F-16 or a B-52
accomplishes a given task, or whether a particular platform is manned or
unmanned, or whether a C-17 or a C-130 delivers a certain load; the outcome of
the mission, the effect achieved, is what's important. Thus, Air Force doctrine
does not explicitly tie specific weapon systems to specific tasks or effects.</span></p>

<p><span>4.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b><i>using mediums</i></b>, not&nbsp;<b><i>owning
mediums</i></b>. This illustrates the importance of properly using a medium to
obtain the best warfighting effects, not of carving up the battlespace based on
Service or functional parochialism. Focusing on using a medium is a vital first
step to integration of efforts.  Ownership  arguments eventually lead to
suboptimal (and usually at best tactical) application of efforts at the expense
of the larger, total effort.</span></p>

<p><span>4.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b><i>organization</i></b>, not&nbsp;<b><i>organizations</i></b>.
Modern warfare demands that disparate parts of different Services, different
nations, and even differing functions within a single Service be brought together
intelligently to achieve unity of command and unity of effort. However, merely
placing different organizations together in an area of operations is
insufficient to meet these demands. A single, cohesive organization is required
with clearly defined lines of command and commanders with requisite authorities
at appropriate levels. Doctrine explains why certain organizational structures
are preferred over others and describes effective command relationships and
command authorities; this facilitates the rapid standup of joint and Service
organizations during rapidly evolving situations. Ultimately, doctrine is not
about whether one particular element of a joint force is more decisive than
another, nor about positing that element as the centerpiece of joint
operations; it's the total, tailored joint force that's decisive. Getting to
that effective joint force requires smart organization and a thorough
understanding of Service and joint doctrine.</span></p>

<p><span>4.2.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b><i>synergy</i></b>, not&nbsp;<b><i>segregation</i></b>.
True integration of effort cannot be achieved by merely carving up the
operational environment. While segregation may have some benefit and may appear
the simplest way, from a command and control viewpoint, to manage elements of a
diverse joint force, it may actually suboptimize the overall effort. It
guarantees that the whole will never be greater than the sum of its parts. For
example, Airmen should have access to the entire theater of operations to
maximize their ability to achieve joint force commander objectives; they should
not be restricted from any area due to unnecessarily restrictive fire control
measures. Also, segregating the battlespace into smaller areas of operation may
create competition for scarce, high-demand, low-density capabilities and reduce
combat effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span>4.2.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b><i>integration</i></b>, not just&nbsp;<b><i>synchronization</i></b>.
Synchronization is defined as  the arrangement of military actions in time,
space, and purpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place
and time  (Joint Publication 1-02). Integration, by comparison, is defined as
 the arrangement of military forces and their actions to create a force that
operates by engaging as a whole  (Joint Publication 1-02). Synchronization is,
in essence, deconfliction in time and space between different units. A useful
means is to plan and execute operations and to prevent fratricide. However, it
doesn t scale up to the operational level and hence is not the best means for
achieving the maximum potential of a joint force. Synchronization emphasizes
timing, while integration considers priority and effect to be both efficient
and effective with scarce resources. Synchronization is bottom-up; integration,
on the other hand, starts at the top with a single cohesive plan and works
downward. Synchronization is an additive  sum of the parts' model, while
integration may produce geometric results.</span></p>

<p><span>4.2.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b><i>the right force</i></b>, not
just&nbsp;<b><i>equal shares of the force</i></b>. This addresses the proper
mix of Service components within a joint force. Some believe that a joint force
requires equal parts of all the Services. This is an incorrect view. As one
senior Air Force officer said,  joint warfighting is not like Little League
baseball, where everybody gets a chance to play.  Any given joint force should
be tailored appropriately for the task at hand. Some operations will be
land-centric, others air-centric, others maritime-, cyberspace-, or
information-centric. The composition of the joint force and the tasks assigned
its various elements should reflect the needs of the situation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.3. Levels of Airpower Doctrine.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>As implemented in the
Air Force, doctrine affects operations at three levels: basic, operational, and
tactical. These levels speak to the intellectual content of the doctrinal concepts,
not to the architectural structure of doctrine publications.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Reference:
Volume 1&nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span> &nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>)</span></a></p>

<p><span>4.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Basic doctrine&nbsp;</span></b><span>states the most fundamental and enduring beliefs that describe and
guide the proper use, presentation, and organization of forces in military
action. Basic doctrine describes the  elemental properties' of airpower and
provides the Airman's perspective. Because of its fundamental and enduring
character, basic doctrine provides broad and continuing guidance on how Air Force
forces are organized, employed, equipped, and sustained. Because it expresses
broad, enduring fundamentals, basic doctrine changes relatively slowly compared
to the other levels of doctrine. As the foundation of all doctrine, basic
doctrine also sets the tone and vision for doctrine development for the future.
Air Force Doctrine Volume 1 is the Air Force's basic doctrine publication.</span></p>

<p><span>4.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operational doctrine&nbsp;</span></b><span>contained in doctrine annexes describe more detailed organization
of forces and applies the principles of basic doctrine to military actions.
Operational doctrine guides the proper organization and employment of air,
space, and cyberspace forces in the context of distinct objectives, force
capabilities, broad functional areas, and operational environments. Operational
doctrine provides the focus for developing the missions and tasks to be
executed through tactical doctrine. Doctrine at this level changes a bit more
rapidly than basic doctrine, but usually only after deliberate internal Service
debate.</span></p>

<p><span>4.3.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Tactical doctrine&nbsp;</span></b><span>describes the proper employment of specific Air Force assets,
individually or in concert with other assets, to accomplish detailed
objectives. Tactical doctrine considers particular objectives (stopping the
advance of an armored column) and conditions (threats, weather, and terrain)
and describes how Air Force assets are employed to accomplish the tactical
objective (B-1 bombers dropping anti-armor cluster munitions). Air Force
tactical doctrine is codified as tactics, techniques, and procedures in Air
Force (Air Force tactics, techniques, and procedures) -3 series manuals.
Because tactical doctrine is closely associated with the employment of
technology and emerging tactics, change will likely occur more rapidly than
other levels of doctrine. Also, due to their sensitive nature, many tactics,
techniques, and procedures are classified.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.4. Airpower:&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower is defined as  the ability to project military power or
influence through the control and exploitation of air, space, and cyberspace to
achieve strategic, operational, or tactical objectives. &nbsp;</span></b><span>The proper application of airpower requires a
comprehensive doctrine of employment and an Airman's perspective. As the
nation's most comprehensive provider of military airpower, the Air Force
conducts continuous and concurrent air, space, and cyberspace operations. The
air, space, and cyberspace capabilities of the other Services serve primarily
to support their organic maneuver paradigms; the Air Force employs air, space, and
cyberspace capabilities with a broader focus on theater-wide and national-level
objectives. Through airpower, the Air Force provides the versatile,
wide-ranging means towards achieving national objectives with the ability to
deter and respond immediately to crises anywhere in the world.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Reference:
Volume 1&nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span> &nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>)</span></a></p>

<p><span>4.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower exploits the third dimension of the operational
environment; the electromagnetic spectrum; and time to leverage speed, range,
flexibility, precision, tempo, and lethality to create effects from and within
the air, space, and cyberspace domains.&nbsp;</span></b><span>From this multi-dimensional perspective, Airmen can apply military
power against an enemy's entire array of diplomatic, informational, military,
and economic instruments of power, at long ranges and on short notice. Airpower
can be applied across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war
simultaneously, significantly increasing the options available to national
leadership. Due to its range, speed, and flexibility, airpower can compress
time, controlling the tempo of operations in our favor. Airpower should be
employed with appropriate consideration of land and maritime power, not just
during operations against enemy forces, but when used as part of a team that
protects and aids friendly forces as well.</span></p>

<p><span>4.4.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Much of what airpower can accomplish from within these three
domains is done to critically affect events in the land and maritime
domains this is the heart of joint domain integration, a fundamental aspect of
airpower's contribution to United States (U.S.) national interests. Airmen
integrate capabilities across air, space, and cyberspace domains to achieve
effects across all domains in support of joint force commander objectives. For
example, a remotely piloted aircraft operating from a ground station in the
continental U.S. relies on space and cyberspace capabilities to support
operations overseas. While all Services rely more and more on such integration,
cross-domain integration is fundamental to how Airmen employ airpower to
complement the joint force.</span></p>

<p><span>4.4.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Airmen exploit the third dimension, which consists of the entire
expanse above the earth's surface. The third dimensions lower limit is the
earth's surface (land or water), and the upper limit reaches toward infinity.
This third dimension consists of the air and space domains. From an operational
perspective, the air domain can be described as that region above the earth s
surface in which aerodynamics generally govern the planning and conduct of
military operations, while the space domain can be described as that region
above the earth's surface in which astrodynamics generally govern the planning
and conduct of military operations. Airmen also exploit operational
capabilities in cyberspace. Cyberspace is  a global domain within the
information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information
technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications
networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.  In
contrast to our surface-oriented sister Services, the Air Force uses air,
space, and cyberspace capabilities to create effects, including many on land
and in the maritime domains, that are ends unto themselves, not just in support
of predominantly land or maritime force activities.</span></p>

<p><span>4.4.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The evolution of contemporary airpower stems from the Airman s
original vision of combat from a distance, bypassing the force-on-force clash
of surface combat. Originally manifest in long-range aircraft delivering
kinetic weapons, airpower has evolved over time to include many long-range
supporting capabilities, notably the conduct of networked information-related
operations. This evolution has accelerated as Airmen conduct a greater
percentage of operations not just over-the-horizon but globally, expanding
operations first through space and now also in cyberspace. Just as airpower
grew from its initial use as an adjunct to surface operations, space and
cyberspace have likewise grown from their original manifestations as supporting
capabilities into warfighting arenas in their own right.</span></p>

<p><span>4.4.3.<b>&nbsp;Air Force
doctrine presents airpower as a unitary construct.&nbsp;</b>The Air Force
acknowledges the importance of the space and cyberspace domains. However, Air
Force doctrine should address what unifies Airmen.<b>&nbsp;</b>Thus, in the Air
Force's senior doctrine product, the use of concepts and language that bind
Airmen together instead of presenting the Air Force as a collection of tribes
broken out in technological stovepipes according to the domains of air, space,
and cyberspace is appropriate. Other subordinate doctrine products delve into
the differences and interdependencies of the core functions and missions
conducted within and across the air, space, and cyberspace domains, and within
the context of more specific types of operations. Where appropriate, this
product will also mention air, space, and cyberspace forces or capabilities.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.5. The Airman's Perspective.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>The practical
application of  airmindedness' results in the Airman's unique perspective,
which can be summarized as follows.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Reference:
Volume 1&nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span> &nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>)</span></a></p>

<p><span>4.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Control of the vertical dimension is generally a necessary
precondition for control of the surface.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The first mission of an air force is to defeat
or neutralize the enemy air forces so friendly operations on land, sea, in the
air, and in space can proceed unhindered, while at the same time one's own
military forces and critical vulnerabilities remain safe from air attack.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower is an inherently strategic force.&nbsp;</span></b><span>War and peace are decided, organized, planned,
supplied, and commanded at the strategic level of war. Air Force forces can
hold an enemy's strategic centers of gravity and critical vulnerabilities
directly at risk immediately and continuously. Airpower also has great
strategic capability for nonlethal strategic influence, as in humanitarian
relief and building partnership activities.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower can exploit the principles of mass and maneuver
simultaneously to a far greater extent than surface forces.&nbsp;</span></b><span>There are no natural lateral boundaries to
prevent air, space, and cyberspace capabilities from quickly concentrating
their power (physically or in terms of delivered effects) at any point, even
when starting from widely dispersed locations. Airpower dominates the fourth
dimension time and compresses the tempo of events to produce physical and
psychological shock.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower can apply force against many facets of enemy power.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Air Force provided capabilities can be brought
to bear against any lawful target within an enemy's diplomatic, informational,
military, economic, and social structures simultaneously or separately. They
can be employed in support of national, combined/joint, or other component
objectives. They can be integrated with surface power or employed
independently.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Air Force forces are less culturally intrusive in many
scenarios.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Surface forces are
composed of many people and vehicles which, when arrayed for operations, cover
a significant area. Thus, their presence may be very visible to local
populations and may create resentment during certain types of stability
operations and in counterinsurgency operations. Air Force forces, operating
from bases over the horizon or from just a few bases in-country, have a smaller
footprint for the effects they provide. Space and cyberspace forces have a
negligible in-theater footprint relative to the capabilities they provide.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower's inherent speed, range, and flexibility combine to make
it one of the most versatile components of military power.&nbsp;</span></b><span>This versatility component allows it to be
rapidly employed against strategic, operational, and tactical objectives
simultaneously. The versatility of airpower derives not only from the inherent
characteristics of air forces themselves, but also from the manner in which they
are organized and controlled.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower results from the effective integration of capabilities,
people, weapons, bases, logistics, and all supporting infrastructure.&nbsp;</span></b><span>No one aspect of air, space, and cyberspace
capabilities should be treated in isolation since each element is essential and
interdependent. Ultimately, the Air Force depends on the performance of the
people who operate, command, and sustain air, space, and cyberspace forces.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.8.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>The choice of appropriate capabilities is a key aspect in the
realization of airpower.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Weapons should be selected based on their ability to create
desired effects on an adversary's capability and will. Achieving the full
potential of airpower requires timely, actionable intelligence and sufficient
command and control capabilities to permit commanders to exploit precision,
speed, range, flexibility, and versatility.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.9.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Supporting bases with their people, systems, and facilities are
essential to launch, recovery, and sustainment of Air Force forces.&nbsp;</span></b><span>One of the most important aspects of the Air
Force has proved to be its ability to move anywhere in the world quickly and
then rapidly begin operations. However, the need for mobility should be
balanced against the need to operate at the deployment site. The availability
and operability of suitable bases can be the dominant factor in employment
planning and execution.</span></p>

<p><span>4.5.10.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Airpower's unique characteristics necessitate that it be centrally
controlled by Airmen.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Airpower
can quickly intervene anywhere, regardless if used for strategic or tactical
purposes. Thus, Airmen tend to take a broader view of war, because the
capabilities they command have effects at broader levels of war. Airmen apply
airpower through the tenet of centralized control and decentralized execution.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.6. Principles of Joint Operations:&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.6.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Throughout the history of conflict, military leaders have noted
certain principles that tended to produce military victory. Known as the
principles of war, they are those aspects of warfare that are universally true
and relevant. As members of the joint team, Airmen should appreciate how these
principles apply to all forces, but should most fully understand them as they
pertain to Air Force forces. Airpower, no matter which Service operates the
systems and no matter which type of platform is used, provides unique
capabilities.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Valid principles, despite how deeply they are held, are no
substitute for sound, professional judgment; however, ignoring them completely
assumes unnecessary risk. The complexity of war in general, and the unique
character of each war in particular, preclude commanders from using these
principles as a checklist to guarantee victory. Rather, they serve as valuable
guides to evaluate potential courses of action. The principles are independent,
but tightly fused in application. No one principle should be considered without
due consideration of the others. These principles are not all inclusive; the
art of developing airpower strategies depends upon the Airman's ability to view
these principles from a three-dimensional perspective and integrate their
application accordingly. The principles of war, combined with the additional
tenets of airpower discussed elsewhere, provide the basis for a sound and

<p><span>4.6.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The principles of war are:</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Unity
of command ensures concentration of effort for every objective under one
responsible commander.&nbsp;</b>This principle emphasizes that all efforts
should be directed and coordinated toward a common objective. Airpower s
operational-level perspective calls for unity of command to gain the most effective
and efficient application. Coordination may be achieved by cooperation;
however, coordination is best achieved by vesting a single commander with the
authority and the capability to direct all force employment in pursuit of a
common objective. In many operations, the wide-ranging interagency and
nongovernmental organizations involved may dilute unity of command. Effective
information-sharing arrangements may preserve unity of effort to ensure common
focus and mutually supporting actions.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.1.1. Unity of
command is vital in employing airpower. Airpower is the product of multiple
capabilities, and centralized control is essential to effectively fuse these
capabilities and provide unity of command.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.2.<b>&nbsp;The
principle of objective is to direct military operations toward a defined and
attainable objective that contributes to strategic, operational, and tactical
aims.&nbsp;</b>In application, this principle refers to unity of effort in
purpose, space, and time. In a broad sense, this principle holds that political
and military goals should be complementary and clearly articulated. A clear
National Military Strategy provides focus for defining campaign or theater
objectives. At the operational level, campaign or theater objectives determine
military priorities.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.2.1. The objective
is important due to the flexibility and versatility of airpower. From the
outset, airpower can pursue tactical, operational, or strategic objectives, in
any combination, or all three simultaneously. By integrating the potential offered
by air, space, and cyberspace capabilities, Airmen can overcome the challenges
imposed by distance and time. From an Airman's perspective, then, the principle
of objective shapes priorities to allow airpower to concentrate on theater or
campaign priorities and seeks to avoid the siphoning of force elements to
fragmented objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.3.<b>&nbsp;The
purpose of an offensive action is to seize, retain, and exploit the
initiative.&nbsp;</b>The offensive aim is to act rather than react and to
dictate the time, place, purpose, scope, intensity, and pace of operations. The
initiative should be seized as soon as possible. The principle of the offensive
holds that offensive action, or initiative, provides the means for joint forces
to dictate operations. Once seized, the initiative should be retained and fully
exploited.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This principle is particularly significant to airpower and is best
used as an offensive weapon. While defense may be dictated by the combat
situation, success in war is generally attained only while on the offensive.
Even highly successful defensive air campaigns such as the World War II Battle
of Britain were based upon selective offensive engagements.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The speed and range of attacking airpower gives it a significant
offensive advantage over other forces. In an air attack, for example, the
defender often requires more forces to defend a given geospatial area than the
attacker requires to strike a set of specific targets. The integration of air,
space, and cyberspace capabilities enhances the advantages of speed, range and
persistence found in airpower.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.3.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Although all military forces have offensive capabilities,
airpower's ability to mass and maneuver, and its ability to operate
independently or simultaneously at the tactical, operational, and/or strategic
levels of war, provides joint force commanders a resource with global reach to
directly and rapidly seize the initiative. Whether deploying forces and
supplies into a region, conducting combat operations, or maintaining information
assurance, airpower provides the joint force commander the means to take the
offensive. Through prompt and sustained offensive actions designed to attain
operational and strategic objectives, airpower causes the enemy to react rather
than act, denies them the offensive, and shapes the remainder of the conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.4.<b>&nbsp;The
purpose of mass is to concentrate the effects of combat power at the most
advantageous place and time to achieve decisive results.&nbsp;</b>Concentration
of military power is a fundamental consideration in all military operations. At
the operational level of war, this principle suggests that superior,
concentrated combat power is used to achieve decisive results.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Airpower is singularly able to launch an attack from widely dispersed
locations and mass combat power at the objective, whether that objective is a
single physical location or a widely dispersed enemy system or systems. From an
Airman's perspective, mass is not based solely on the quantity of forces and
materiel committed. Airpower achieves mass through effectiveness of attack, not
just overwhelming numbers. Contemporary airpower has altered the concept of
massed forces. The speed, range, and flexibility of airpower complemented by
the accuracy and lethality of precision weapons and advances in information
technologies allow it to achieve mass faster than other forces.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Air Force cyberspace capabilities, often enabled by space systems,
allow dispersed forces to collaborate to rapidly find, fix, track, and target
fleeting targets and mass a response in new ways. Previously, operators and
planners worked in relative proximity within the same theater of operations;
today, those same planners and operators leverage distributed capabilities to
apply precise effects around the globe.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.4.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Airlift and air refueling provide a significant and critical
capability to mass lethal and nonlethal forces on a global scale. The
capability of airpower to act quickly and mass effects, along with its
capability to mass other lethal and nonlethal military power, combine the
principle of mass with the principle of maneuver.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.5.<b>&nbsp;Maneuver
places the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application
of combat power in a multidimensional combat space.&nbsp;</b>Airpower's ability
to conduct maneuver is not only a product of its speed and range, but also
flows from its flexibility and versatility during the planning and execution of
operations. Maneuver, like the principle of offensive, forces the enemy to
react, allowing the exploitation of successful friendly operations and reducing
friendly vulnerabilities. Airpower maneuver allows engagement anywhere, from
any direction, at any time, forcing the adversary to be on guard everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.5.1. The principle
of maneuver is not limited to simple weapons delivery. Maneuver may involve the
strategic positioning of capabilities that bring potential airpower to bear
within striking distance of potential or actual adversaries. Forward deployment
of airpower assets is one example of maneuver that, by its very presence, can
reassure allies and deter aggressors. Also, in airlift operations such as
SUPPORT HOPE in Rwanda, PROVIDE HOPE in the former Soviet Union, or PROVIDE
PROMISE in Bosnia; focused civilmilitary operations and exercises that support
theater security cooperation goals, such as PACIFIC ANGEL; or combat operations
such as ALLIED FORCE in Serbia, ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan, or IRAQI
FREEDOM in Iraq, airpower has played a critical role in American national
security by providing unmatched maneuverability. Whether it involves airlift or
attack aircraft, in small or large numbers, the versatility and responsiveness
of airpower allow the simultaneous application of mass and maneuver.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.6.<b>&nbsp;Economy
of force is the judicious employment and distribution of forces.&nbsp;</b>Its
purpose is to allocate minimum essential resources to secondary efforts. This
principle calls for the rational use of force by selecting the best mix of air,
space, and cyberspace capabilities. To ensure overwhelming combat power is
available, maximum effort should be devoted to primary objectives. At the
operational level of war, commanders ensure that any effort made towards
secondary objectives does not degrade achievement of the larger operational or
strategic objectives. This principle requires Airmen to maintain a broader
operational view even as they seek to obtain clearly articulated objectives and
priorities.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.6.1. Economy of
force may require a commander to establish a balance in the application of
airpower between attacking, defending, delaying, or conducting other operations
such as information operations, depending on the importance of the area or the
priority of the objective or objectives. Also, priorities may shift rapidly;
friendly troops in contact might drive a change in priority from one type of
mission (e.g., interdiction) to another (e.g., close air support). Although
this principle suggests the use of overwhelming force in one sense, it also
recommends guarding against the  overkill  inherent in the use of more force
than reasonably necessary. This is particularly relevant when excessive force
can diminish the legitimacy and support for an operation.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.7.<b>&nbsp;The
purpose of security is to never permit the enemy to acquire unexpected advantage.&nbsp;</b>Friendly
forces and their operations should be protected from enemy action that could
provide the enemy with unexpected advantage. The lethal consequences of enemy
attack make the security of friendly forces a paramount concern.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.7.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Critical to security is the understanding that it embraces
physical security, operations security, and security of the information
environment. Information has always been part of air, land, and sea warfare;
now, with the proliferation of advanced communications and computer
technologies, it becomes even more central to the outcome of a conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.7.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Aircraft are most vulnerable on the ground.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Thus, force protection is an integral part of
airpower employment. Fixed bases are especially vulnerable as they not only
should withstand aerial, ground, and cyberspace attacks, but should also
sustain concentrated and prolonged air, space, and cyberspace activities
against the enemy.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.7.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>From an Airman's perspective,&nbsp;<b>security also may be
obtained by staying beyond the enemy's reach, physically and virtually.&nbsp;</b>Airpower
is uniquely suited to capitalize on this through its ability to operate over
the horizon. Not only can airpower reach and strike at extended range, but it
also can distribute data and analysis as well as command and control across a
worldwide span.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.7.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Security from physical and electronic enemy intrusion conceals our
capabilities and intentions, while allowing friendly forces the freedom to
gather information on the adversary the type of information that creates the
opportunity to strike the enemy where least expected. By exploiting the
vertical mediums of air and space, Airmen provide security for our nation and
friendly forces by detecting enemy actions and determining intentions even in
denied areas.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.7.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Commanders have an obligation to protect their forces, but the
threat and the means for countering it are quite different in contingency
operations. The threat varies depending on local circumstances, but the
commander must be aware that it always exists. Although U.S. forces have a
right to self-defense, Airmen must bear in mind the concepts of necessity and
proportionality when exercising that right (as discussed in the standing rules
of engagement).&nbsp;<b>Necessity&nbsp;</b>exists when a hostile act occurs or
when a force demonstrates hostile intent; use of force is then authorized while
the force continues to commit hostile acts or exhibit hostile intent.&nbsp;<b>Proportionality&nbsp;</b>means
the use of force should be sufficient to respond decisively, and may exceed the
means and intensity of the hostile act/intent, but the nature, duration and
scope of force should not exceed what is required.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.7.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The concepts of necessity and proportionality as applicable to
self-defense should not be confused with those of military necessity and
proportionality as applicable in the law of armed conflict, which together seek
to minimize collateral damage during offensive or defensive operations during
armed conflict. Indeed, the defense of friendly forces against enemy attack
during armed conflict would not (subject to prevailing rules of engagement)
involve the concept of self-defense at all.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.8.<b>&nbsp;Surprise
leverages the principle of security by attacking the enemy at a time, place, or
in a manner for which they are not prepared.&nbsp;</b>The speed and range of
air, space, and cyberspace capabilities, coupled with their flexibility and
versatility, allow air forces to achieve surprise more readily than other
forces. The final choice of timing and tactics rests with the air component
commander because terrain and distance are not inhibiting factors.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.8.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Surprise is one of
airpower's strongest advantages. Operation EL DORADO CANYON (the U.S. raid on
Libya) and the opening day of the air campaign during Operation DESERT STORM
highlight examples where airpower achieved surprise.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.8.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Airpower can enhance and
empower other forces to achieve surprise as well. The rapid global reach of
airpower can enable surface forces to reach foreign destinations quickly, thus
seizing the initiative through surprise.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.3.9.<b>&nbsp;Simplicity
calls for avoiding unnecessary complexity in organizing, preparing, planning,
and conducting military operations.&nbsp;</b>Simplicity ensures that guidance,
plans, and orders are as simple and direct as the objective allows. Simple
guidance allows subordinate commanders the freedom to operate creatively within
their portion of the operational environment, supporting the concept of
decentralized execution. Common equipment, a common understanding of Service and
joint doctrine, and familiarity with procedures through joint exercises and
training, can help overcome complexity. Straightforward plans, unambiguous
organization, and clearly-defined command relationships are central to reducing
complexity as well.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.4.&nbsp;<b>Additional Principles of
Operations.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In addition to the
traditionally-held principles of war, an additional set of principles has been
developed as a result of experience in contingency operations. These were first
cast as  principles of military operations other than war  and later as  the
political dimension of smaller-scale contingencies.  A distinguishing
characteristic of such operations has been the degree to which political
objectives influence operations and tactics. (Note that joint doctrine does not
contain unity of effort as an additional principle.) These additional
principles are:</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Often
the military is not the sole, or even the lead, agency in contingency
operations.&nbsp;</b>Some operations are, by their nature, predominantly
military. In most situations, however, the military will likely be one agency
of many. As is especially common in stability operations, military forces often
find themselves supporting the other instruments of national power. While unity
of command is critical within the military forces, most of these operations
demand unity of effort among a wide range of agencies to ensure that they
coordinate their resources and focus on the same goal.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.4.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Unity
of effort becomes critical during interagency operations and can best be
achieved through consensus building.&nbsp;</b>Whereas the main effort in
military planning is on developing courses of action, the main effort in
interagency planning should be to develop a shared, detailed understanding of
the situation. This allows the various agencies to better understand how they
can best apply their respective capabilities and measure success.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Restraint
is the disciplined application of military force appropriate to the
situation.&nbsp;</b>Commanders should recognize that in some types of
operations, use of more force than the minimum that is reasonably necessary
(even though under or at the maximum permissible) may lead to escalation to a
higher intensity conflict; could adversely affect efforts to gain or maintain
legitimacy; and may impede the attainment of both short- and long-term goals.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.4.2.1. Air component
commanders should begin developing a force structure by outlining the necessary
capabilities needed for an operation and then follow up by deploying the
appropriate  tailored  air, space, and cyberspace force mix. In order to
maintain effective security while also exercising restraint, commanders should
develop very clear rules on the use of force and rules of engagement. The rules
of engagement for contingency operations are often more restrictive, detailed,
and sensitive to political concerns than in sustained combat operations.
Moreover, these rules may change frequently during operations. For all
operations, Airmen should understand that restraint in the use of force is appropriate
and more easily justified. However, restraint does not preclude the ability to
use armed force, both lethal and nonlethal, when necessary in self-defense.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.4.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>The principle of perseverance encompasses the patient, resolute,
and persistent pursuit of national goals and objectives, for as long as
necessary to achieve them.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Some contingency operations involve a one-time occurrence or a
short-term operation to maintain stability until local authorities can take
over. Many missions, however, especially peace operations and building partner
capacity, require a long-term commitment. The U.S. should be prepared to stay
involved in a region for a protracted time in order to achieve its strategic
goals. Complex problems often cannot be solved quickly; if a situation has been
building for a long time, it may take the same amount of time or longer to
resolve it. With this in mind, objectives should be established for the
conditions under which forces may leave, rather than simply by a timetable for
departure.</span></p>

<p><span>4.6.4.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>In order to reduce the threat to U.S. forces and to enable them to
work toward their objective, the U.S. should be viewed as a legitimate actor in
the mission, working towards multi-lateral interests including our own.&nbsp;</span></b><span>While legitimacy is principally generated by
U.S. political leadership, legitimacy in the eyes of the host nation or target
population could be affected more by the actions of the military. One key means
of promoting legitimacy for certain types of contingency operations is through
robust and effective military public affairs operations. Commanders should work
closely with the host-nation government (if, in fact, there is one) at all
levels to help preserve and foster the sense of legitimacy of mission.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.7. Tenets of Airpower.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>The application of
airpower is refined by several fundamental guiding truths. These truths are
known as tenets. They reflect not only the unique historical and doctrinal
evolution of airpower, but also the current appreciation for the nature of
airpower. The tenets of airpower complement the principles of joint operations.
While the principles of war provide general guidance on the application of
military forces, the tenets provide more specific considerations for the
employment of airpower. The tenets of airpower are identified below.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Reference:
Volume 1&nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span> &nbsp;</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>Basic
Doctrine</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm"><span>)</span></a></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.&nbsp;<b>The tenet
of centralized control and decentralized execution is critical to effective
employment of airpower.</b>&nbsp;Indeed, they are the fundamental organizing
principles for airpower, having been proven over decades of experience as the
most effective and efficient means of employing it. This tenet enables the
principle of mass while maintaining economy of force. Because of airpower s
unique potential to directly affect the strategic and operational levels of
war, it should be controlled by a single Airman who maintains the broad,
strategic perspective necessary to balance and prioritize the use of a
powerful, highly desired yet limited force.<b>&nbsp;</b>A single air component
commander, focused on the broader aspects of an operation, can best balance or
mediate urgent demands for tactical support against longer-term strategic and
operational requirements. The ability to concentrate the air effort to fulfill
the highest priorities for effects and to quickly shift the effort can only be
accomplished through centralized control. On the other hand, the flexibility to
take advantage of tactical opportunities and to effectively respond to shifting
local circumstances can only be achieved through decentralized execution.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>This tenet is best appreciated as a general philosophy for the
command and control of airpower. The construct of centralized control is an
encapsulation of a hard-learned truth: that control of a valuable yet scarce
resource (airpower) should be commanded by a single Airman, not parceled out
and hardwired to subordinate surface echelons as it was prior to 1943. Tied to
this fundamental truth is the recognition that no single Airman is capable of
making all decisions, and should thus empower subordinates to respond in
accordance with senior leader intent.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Centralized control should be accomplished by an Airman at the
functional component commander level who maintains a broad focus on the joint
force commander's objectives to direct, integrate, prioritize, plan,
coordinate, and assess the use of air, space, and cyberspace assets across the
range of military operations. Centralized control may be manifest at different
levels within a combatant command depending on how the air component(s) is
(are) organized and the nature of the supporting command and control
architecture (functional or geographic). Also, due to the dynamics of the
operational environment, control over some capabilities may, over time, shift
up or down the command chain according to changes in priorities.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Centralized control empowers the air component commander to
respond to changes in the operational environment and take advantage of
fleeting opportunities, and embodies the tenet of flexibility and versatility.<b>&nbsp;</b>Some
would rather this be just  centralized planning and direction.  From an
Airman's perspective,  planning and directing  do not convey all aspects of
control implied in  centralized control,  which maximizes the flexibility and
effectiveness of airpower. Centralized control is thus pivotal to the
determination of continuing advantage. However, it should not become a recipe
for micromanagement, stifling the initiative subordinates need to deal with
combat's inevitable uncertainties.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Decentralized execution is defined as the  delegation of authority
to designated lower-level commanders' and other tactical-level decision makers
to achieve effective span of control and to foster disciplined initiative and
tactical flexibility. It allows subordinates, all the way down to the tactical
level, to exploit situational responsiveness and fleeting opportunities in
rapidly changing, fluid situations. The benefits inherent in decentralized
execution, however, are maximized only when a commander clearly communicates
intent and subordinate commanders frame their actions accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Centralized control and decentralized execution of airpower
provide broad global or theater-wide focus while allowing operational
flexibility to meet military objectives. They assure concentration of effort
while maintaining economy of force. They exploit airpower's versatility and
flexibility to ensure that it remains responsive, survivable, and sustainable.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Execution should be decentralized within a C2 architecture that
exploits the ability of front-line decision makers (such as strike package
leaders, air battle managers, forward air controllers) to make on-scene
decisions during complex, rapidly unfolding operations. Modern communications
technology may tempt commanders to take direct control of distant events and
override the decisions of forward leaders, even when such control is not
operationally warranted. This should be resisted at all costs in all functional
components' not just air. Despite impressive gains in data exploitation and
automated decision aids, a single person cannot, with confidence, achieve and
maintain detailed situational awareness over individual missions when fighting
a conflict involving many simultaneous engagements taking place throughout a
large area, or over individual missions conducted in locally fluid and complex
environments.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.1.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There may be some situations where there may be valid reasons for
control of specific operations at higher levels, most notably when the JFC (or
perhaps even higher authorities) may wish to control strategic effects, even at
the sacrifice of tactical efficiency. However, such instances should be rare,
as in the short notice prosecution of high-value, time-sensitive targets, or
when the operational climate demands tighter control over selected missions due
to political sensitivities, such as the potential for collateral damage or
mistargeting, or in the case of nuclear employment. In all cases, senior
commanders balance overall campaign execution against the pressing need for
tactical effectiveness. As long as a subordinate's decision supports the
superior commander's intent and meets campaign objectives, subordinates should
be allowed to take the initiative during execution.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.2. Although often
used interchangeably, flexibility and versatility are different.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Flexibility allows airpower to exploit mass and maneuver
simultaneously.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Flexibility allows
airpower to shift from one campaign objective to another, quickly and
decisively; to  go downtown  on one sortie, then hit fielded enemy forces the
next; to re-role assets quickly from a preplanned mission to support an
unanticipated need for close air support of friendly troops in contact with
enemy forces.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Versatility is the ability to employ airpower effectively at the
strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war and provide a wide variety of
tasks in concert with other joint force elements.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Airpower has the potential to achieve this
unmatched synergy through asymmetric and parallel operations. Space and
cyberspace capabilities are especially able to simultaneously support multiple
taskings around the globe and support tasks at all levels of warfare.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Synergistic Effects. The proper application of a coordinated force
across multiple domains can produce effects that exceed the contributions of
forces employed individually.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The destruction of a large number of targets through attrition
warfare is rarely the key objective in modern war. Instead, the objective is
the precise, coordinated application of the various elements of airpower and
surface power to bring disproportionate pressure on enemy leaders to comply
with our national will (affecting their intent) or to cause functional defeat
of the enemy forces (affecting their capability). Airpower's ability to observe
adversaries allows joint force commanders to counter enemy movements with unprecedented
speed and agility. Airpower is unique in its ability to dictate the tempo and
direction of an entire warfighting effort regardless of the scale of the
operation.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Persistence. Air, space, and cyberspace operations may be
conducted continuously against a broad spectrum of targets.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Airpower's exceptional speed and range
allow its forces to visit and revisit wide ranges of targets nearly at
will.Airpower does not have to occupy terrain or remain constantly in proximity
to areas of operation to bring force upon targets. Space forces in particular
hold the ultimate high ground, and as space systems continue to advance and
proliferate, they offer the potential for persistent overhead access; unmanned
aircraft systems offer similar possibilities from the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Examples of persistent operations might be maintaining a
continuous flow of materiel to peacetime distressed areas; Air Force
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities monitoring
adversaries to ensure they cannot conduct actions counter to those agreed upon;
assuring that targets are kept continually out of commission; or ensuring that
resources and facilities are denied an enemy or provided to an ally during a
specified time. The end result would be to deny the opponent an opportunity to
seize the initiative and to directly accomplish assigned tasks.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Factors such as enemy resilience, effective defenses, or
environmental concerns may prevent commanders from quickly attaining their
objectives. However, for many situations, airpower provides the most efficient
and effective means to attain national objectives. Commanders must persist in
the conduct of operations and resist pressures to divert resources to other
efforts unless such diversions are vital to attaining theater goals or to
survival of an element of the joint force. Given sufficient time, even the most
devastating strategic effects can be circumvented by resourceful enemies; the
goal is to keep pressure on and not allow the enemy that time.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Concentration. One of the most constant and important trends
throughout military history has been the effort to concentrate overwhelming
power at the decisive time and place.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The principles of mass and economy of force deal directly
with concentrating overwhelming power at the right time and the right place (or
places). The versatility of airpower with its lethality, speed, and persistence
makes it an attractive option for many tasks. With capabilities as flexible and
versatile as airpower, the demand for them often exceeds the available forces
and may result in the fragmentation of the integrated airpower effort in
attempts to fulfill the many demands of the operation. Depending on the
operational situation, such a course of action may court the triple risk of
failing to achieve operational-level objectives, delaying or diminishing the
attainment of decisive effects, and increasing the attrition rate of air
forces and consequently risking defeat. Airmen should guard against the
inadvertent dilution of airpower effects resulting from high demand.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Priority. Commanders should establish clear priorities for the use
of airpower.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Due to its inherent
flexibility and versatility, the demands for airpower may likely exceed
available resources. If commanders fail to establish priorities, they can
become ineffective.<b>&nbsp;</b>Commanders of all components need to
effectively prioritize their requirements for coordinated airpower effects to
the joint force commander, and only then can effective priorities for the use of
airpower flow from an informed dialogue between the joint force commander and
the air component commander. The air component commander should assess the
possible uses of component forces and their strengths and capabilities to
support the overall joint campaign. Limited resources require that airpower be
applied where it can make the greatest contribution to the most critical
current joint force commander requirements. The application of airpower should
be balanced among its ability to conduct operations at all levels of war, often
simultaneously. The principles of mass, offensive, and economy of force, the
tenet of concentration, and the Airman's strategic perspective all apply to
prioritizing airpower.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Balance is an essential guideline for air commanders.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Much of the skill of an air component
commander is reflected in the dynamic and correct balancing of the principles
of joint operations and the tenets of airpower to bring Air Force capabilities
together to produce synergistic effects.&nbsp;</b>An air component commander
should balance combat opportunity, necessity, effectiveness, efficiency, and
the impact on accomplishing assigned objectives against the associated risk to
friendly forces.</span></p>

<p><span>4.7.7.1. An Airman is
uniquely and best suited to determine the proper theater-wide balance between
offensive and defensive air operations, and among strategic, operational, and
tactical applications. Air, space, and cyberspace assets are normally available
only in finite numbers; thus, balance is a crucial determinant for an air
component commander.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 4C</span></i></b><b><span> <i>Air Expeditionary Force</i></span></b></p>

<p><b><span>4.8. Air Expeditionary Force:</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.8.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>AEF
Concept.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The AEF concept provides
forces and support on a rotational and relatively more predictable basis. The
AEF  force generation  construct establishes a predictable, standardized battle
rhythm to ensure operational forces are organized, trained, equipped, and ready
to respond to CCDRs' requests for forces. Using a rotational capacity
construct, deployed units undergo a period of dwell (i.e., time spent at home
station) before entering another deployment/mobilization vulnerability period.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Expeditionary
Capabilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force relies on
the AEF as a force management tool to sustain capabilities while rapidly
responding to emerging crises. The Air Force supports global combatant
commander requirements through a combination of assigned, attached
(rotational), and mobility forces that may be forward deployed, transient, or
operating from home station. There are four major elements of the AEF
structure: readily available force, enabler force, inplace support, and
institutional force. The first three elements are components that primarily
constitute the Air Force's warfighting capability and are therefore postured in
unit type codes.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Readily Available Force.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The readily available force is the primary pool from which
the Air Force fulfills Global Force Management Allocation Plan requirements. To
meet these requirements, the Air Force aligns its warfighting capabilities
(i.e. forces from combat, combat support, and combat service support
organizations) based on requirements relative to assigned rotational
capabilities for each vulnerability period.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>In-place Support.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>In-place Support.</b>&nbsp;There are two types of
in-place support; forces that almost exclusively employ in direct support of a
combatant commander mission, and those that represent the minimum number of
requirements to support critical home station operations. In-place support
forces are also included in the AEF Concepts.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Demand Force Team.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Demand Force Teams include user assets with a unique set of
mission capabilities, such as global mobility forces, Special Operation Forces,
personnel recovery forces, space forces, and other uniquely categorized forces
that provide support to authorized organizations within and outside the
Department of Defense. Most high demand/low supply assets, like these are
postured as Demand Force Teams and will rotate as operational requirements
dictate. Due to their unique nature, they cannot be easily aligned in AEF
battle rhythm; however, every effort must be made to develop a sustainable plan
by the Headquarters Air Force/major command functional area managers as a part
of the enabler nomination request package.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Institutional Force.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The institutional force consists of those forces assigned to
organizations responsible for Secretary of the Air Force directed Title 10
functions at the Air Force level (such as organize, train, equip, recruit,
supply, etc.). Examples of these forces include: Military Training Instructors,
technical school instructors, and personnel assigned to major commands and
Headquarters staff. These organizations will not posture unit type codes in the
unit type code availability, unless a waiver is granted by Headquarters Air
Force. Although these organizations do not represent a war-fighting capability,
the individuals assigned to these organizations are deployable.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>AEF Battle Rhythm.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The AEF operates on a 24-month life cycle. This cycle
includes periods of normal training, preparation, and deployment vulnerability.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For most forces, the majority of the AEF battle rhythm is spent in
normal training during which forces concentrate on unit missions and basic
proficiency events in accordance with applicable Air Force directives and Air
Force Specialty Code requirements. This may include Joint, Air Force, or major
command exercise participation such as Red Flag and Silver Flag. Most
contingency and deployment training should take place during this period. This
training and exercise period is also used to fill the unit's assigned/committed
mission requirements, filling contingency requirements for 30 days or less and
crisis response needs including humanitarian response operations and
operational plans.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Post-deployment reconstitution is included in this period. During
the month immediately after deployment, the unit is focused on recovery.
Permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment moves into and
out of the unit will be de-conflicted to the maximum extent possible to occur
during the 3-month period immediately after the vulnerability period.</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.2.5.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For forces aligned in the Enabler force, unit commanders should
develop a deployment schedule that provides a measure of predictability to
associated Airmen. However, operational requirements may force deviations from
the applicable battle rhythm. Major command vice commanders will ensure
appropriate mechanisms are in place to ensure Airmen postured as Enablers are
provided a measure of predictability/stability</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Global
Force Management.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Global force management
is the process the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff use to assign forces to combatant commander for mission accomplishment
and allocate additional forces to combatant commanders in the event of
contingency operations and apportion forces for combatant commander planning in
the event contingency operations escalate. Global force management also
provides senior decision makers a process to quickly and accurately assess the
impact and risk of proposed changes in force assignment, apportionment, and
allocation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>AEF
Schedule.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The AEF schedule
operates on two 12-month life cycles that align with the global force
management cycle and coincide with fiscal years. Prior to the beginning of
every AEF cycle, Air Force specialty functional area managers will revalidate
the deployment to dwell period alignment of their respective capability areas
and realign forces if necessary. The Air Force goal is that functional areas
align to the least strenuous deployment to dwell baseline to minimize risk to
the force. Every 12 months a new 24-month AEF schedule will be established</span></p>

<p><span>4.8.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>AEF
Teaming Construct.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force has transitioned
to the AEF Teaming concept. This construct provides a better teaming concept
through larger groupings of unit type codes from fewer units/bases in order to
allow Airmen to deploy with their supervisors and members of their unit/base.
This allows for shared common experiences throughout the deployment process.
However, it should be noted, there will be no change to how the Air Force
presents forces (air expeditionary task force (rotational), Component-major
command-Numbered Air Force (in-place)).</span></p>



<p><b><span>4.9. Air Expeditionary Force Schedule and
Posturing:</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.9.1.<b>&nbsp;Posturing.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The basic building block
used in force planning and the deployment of forces is the unit type code. A
unit type code is a Joint Chiefs of Staff developed and assigned code, five-character
alphanumeric designator uniquely identifying each type unit in the Armed
Forces, and its force capability with personnel and/or equipment requirements.
The assignment of a unit type code categorizes each type organization into a
class or kind of unit having common distinguishing characteristics. All Air
Force personnel contribute to the AEF and are inherently deployable or
employable in-place. Those organizations identified as a Combat, Combat
Support, or Combat Service Support or  war-fighting  organizations will posture
unit type codes. Institutional organizations identified as  other  will not
posture unit type codes. Posturing unit type codes is based on an
organization's funded military authorizations as shown in unit manpower
document.</span></p>

<p><span>4.9.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>AEF forces can be postured as forces&nbsp;<i>ready to deploy</i>&nbsp;to
support combatant commander worldwide requirements, home station requirements,
or reach back support to combatant commanders. This provides balanced
war-fighting capabilities across the AEF Construct to support combatant
commander requirements. With unit chain-of-command involvement and major
command leadership and/or AEF cell oversight, major command functional area
managers must determine which unit type codes to posture based on operational
need, organizational specifics, and posturing codes within their functional
area. Not all unit type codes will be postured, units may be tasked to support
a unit type codes they have not postured as long as the unit can meet the unit
type code's mission capability statement.</span></p>

<p><span>4.9.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The various posturing codes (P-codes) indicate the number of unit
type codes that are required for assigned/committed missions, critical home
station requirements, and the number of unit type codes available to be
simultaneously tasked for deployment.</span></p>

<p><span>4.9.1.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>DP.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The minimum number of
unit type codes required to accomplish the unit's assigned/committed missions
either deployed or in-place. Assigned/committed missions include CCDR missions
as well as those of external organizations/agencies that the unit must
accomplish.</span></p>

<p><span>4.9.1.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>DX.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Represents the minimum
number of unit type code requirements to support critical home station
operations. These missions are not associated with the assigned/committed
mission; failure to accomplish these missions would not impact the
assigned/committed mission requirements of the unit.</span></p>

<p><span>4.9.1.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>DW.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Represents the maximum
number of unit type code requirements available to support CCDR's rotational
mission.</span></p>

<p><span>4.9.2.&nbsp;<b>AEF Indicators:</b></span></p>

<p><span>4.9.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>All Airmen will be given an AEF indicator within 15-days of Date
Arrive Station. For individuals assigned to readily available forces, their AEF
indicator will correspond to the same AEF period as the unit's unit type codes.
For individuals assigned to the Institutional Force, the AEF indicator will
correspond to an AEF vulnerability period determined by the Airman's commander
or equivalent. Except in cases of reaching forward, individuals will deploy
during their associated AEF vulnerability period. Changing an individual's AEF
indicator will be done only under extenuating circumstances, along with
permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment.</span></p>

<p><span>4.9.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>AEF indicator Association Review. Prior to the start of each AEF
Schedule, unit commanders will review AEF indicator codes of assigned Airmen to
ensure they match unit type code alignment. In the case of the institutional
force, organization commanders (or equivalent) will review AEF indicator codes
to ensure equal distribution across the five vulnerability periods to the
maximum extent possible while meeting the needs of the organization.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.10. Deployment Planning Systems and Tools:</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.10.1.&nbsp;<b>Adaptive
Planning and Execution System (APEX).</b>&nbsp;Joint operation planning occurs
within a system of joint policies, procedures, and reporting structures known
as APEX. APEX is supported by communications and information technology that is
used by the joint planning and execution community to monitor, design, plan,
execute, and assess mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment,
redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations.
APEX formally integrates the planning activities of the joint planning and
execution community and facilitates the seamless transition from planning to execution
during times of crisis. APEX is the physical, virtual, and policy structure
through which national strategic guidance is translated all the way down to
levels used by the Air Force to plan and execute deployment activities.
National strategic guidance proceeds through the following levels down to Air
Force-specific guidance on deployment and support for the AEF.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>National-Level Strategies</span></b><span>. The National Security Strategy<i>&nbsp;</i>is prepared by the
president for Congress, outlining our nation's major security concerns and how
the administration plans to address them using all instruments of national
power (diplomatic, informational, and economic as well as military). The
National Defense Strategy describes how the Department of Defense will support
the objectives lined out in the National Security Strategy, as well as
providing a framework for other Department of Defense guidance, specifically on
deliberate planning, force development, and intelligence. The National Military
Strategy provides the Chairman Joint Chief of Staff advice regarding the
security environment; it also defines national-level military objectives (i.e.,
ends), how to accomplish these objectives (ways), and addresses the military
capabilities required to execute the strategy (means). The Quadrennial Defense
Review helps articulate the latest National Security Strategy and National
Defense Strategy by defining force structure, modernization plans, and budget
plans.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Unified Command Plan.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The Unified Command Plan establishes combatant command missions
and responsibilities, addresses assignment of forces, delineates geographic
areas of responsibility for geographic combatant commanders, and specifies
responsibilities for functional combatant commanders.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Guidance for Employment of the Force.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The Guidance for Employment of the Force
provides twoyear direction to combatant commands for operational planning,
force management, security cooperation, and posture planning. The Guidance for
Employment of the Force is the method through which the Secretary of Defense
translates strategic priorities in the National Security Strategy, National
Defense Strategy, and Quadrennial Defense Review into implementable direction
for operational activities.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.1.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan is the
primary vehicle through which the Joint Chiefs of Staff exercise responsibility
for directing the preparation of joint plans. The Joint Strategic Capabilities
Plan provides military strategic- and operational-level guidance to combatant
commanders, Service Chiefs, combat support agencies, and applicable Department
of Defense agencies for preparation of combatant commanders' ongoing,
steady-state campaign plans, as well as plans for specific contingencies or
operations,&nbsp;<i>based on current military capabilities</i>. The Joint
Strategic Capabilities Plan is the link between strategic guidance provided in
the Guidance for Employment of the Force and joint operation planning
activities and products that accomplish that guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.2.&nbsp;<b>U.S. Air
Force War and Mobilization Plan (WMP).</b>&nbsp;The WMP is the Air Force s
five-volume supporting document to the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan. The
WMP volumes provide the Air Staff, planners, and commanders with current policies,
planning factors, and Chairman Joint Chief of Staff-apportioned forces for
conducting and supporting operations. The five volumes consist of:</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Volume 1, Basic Plan and Supporting Supplements (WMP-1)</span></b><span>, provides a consolidated reference source for
general policies and guidance for mobilization planning and the support of
combat forces in war and other operations.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Volume 2, Plans Listing and Summary (WMP-2)</span></b><span>, is the single-source listing of all active
plans with time-phased force and deployment data, or at least the Air Force
portions of the time-phased force and deployment data). Part 1 lists all
combatant commander plans required by the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan.
Part 2 consists of the supporting plans written by component headquarters in
support of Part 1, including the Air Force Service component.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Volume 3, Combat and Support Forces (WMP-3)</span></b><span>, contains four parts: Part 1 lists combat
forces.&nbsp;<i>When building the Air Force time-phased force and deployment
data to accompany plans, component headquarters use only forces identified in
Vol. 3, Part 1.</i>&nbsp;Part 2 lists the Air Force unit type code
availability, containing all postured unit type code capability in the Air
Force. Part 3 contains the Air Force Readiness Spares Package authorization
document. Part 4 contains the capability annexes to the AEF Force Presence
Policy, which describes how the Air Force makes its forces available through
assignment, apportionment, and allocation to combatant commanders.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Volume 4, Wartime Aircraft Activity (WMP-4)</span></b><span>, documents aircraft movement and operation by
geographic location in plans, listed by current year (Part 1) and one year out
(Part 2). It also provides guidance for and lists war reserve materiel, mission
oriented items, and non-aircraft unit related ration requirements, again by
location.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.2.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Volume 5, Basic Planning Factors and Data (WMP-5)</span></b><span>, provides approved U.S. Air Force planning
factors by aircraft type and theater, serving as a basis for establishing
worldwide support for programmed force levels, based on aircraft apportioned in
the WMP-3 in support of the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The information
contained in the WMP's volumes provides the basis for Air Force component-level
planning in support of combatant commanders' theater and functional campaign
plans. These specify strategies for the combatant commands' steady-state,
ongoing operations in support of national guidance. The WMP also supports
deliberate planning for specific contingency operations, which are generally
specific branches or sequels of combatant commanders' campaign plans, and which
may be developed into detailed  on-the-shelf  concept plans (with or without an
Air Force time-phased force and deployment data) or operation plans. These
concept plans and operation plans then often form the basis of crisis action
planning for related contingencies. Such plans will contain tasking for the Air
Force Service component as well as the joint or combined functional air
component. Crisis action planning will further develop requirements into
specific operation orders (such as warning, planning, alert, and execute
orders) applicable to particular units. It is important to realize, however,
that commanders and planners can  reach down  from any of the levels explained
above and require base- or unit-level deployment planning (and sometimes
execution) from theater campaign plans all the ways down to crisis execution
orders.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Base
Level Deployment Planning and Execution:</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Force Presence.&nbsp;</span></b><span>All Air Force personnel contribute to the AEF. Air Force Personnel
Center (or other designated force manager) supports AEF operations by
identifying the most ready and available forces as part of unit type codes or
as individuals to meet the stated requirement.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Designed Operational Capabilities Statement.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Document prepared by a parent major
command that consolidates reporting criteria and information based on
Authoritative Data Sources requirements and Functional Manager inputs. The designed
operational capabilities statement compiles Core Mission Essential Task List,
War and Mobilization Plan, unit type code Availability and specific resources
units are required to report. The designed operational capabilities statement
ensures standards of reporting and to assist the units and commanders with
gathering and reporting readiness data.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mission Capability Statement.</span></b><span>&nbsp;A short paragraph describing the mission capabilities that
higher headquarters planners expect of a specific unit type code. The statement
usually contains pertinent information such as the type of base where
commanders will deploy the unit, the unit's functional activities, and other
augmentation requirements necessary to conduct specific missions.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operation Plan.</span></b><span>&nbsp;An
operation plan is any plan for the conduct of military operations prepared in
response to actual or potential contingencies. They are based upon stated
assumptions and are in the form of directive employed by higher authority to
permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting plans and orders. Combatant
commanders create operation plans in response to strategic-level guidance and
commanders of subordinate commands may also create them in response to
requirements tasked by the establishing unified commander. Operation plans are
prepared in either complete format, containing a full description of the
concept of operations, all annexes applicable to the plan, and a time-phased
force and deployment data, or as a concept plan, with or without a time-phased
force and deployment data.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Time Phased Force and Deployment Data.&nbsp;</span></b><span>When developing or executing plans, a time
phased force and deployment data is the data base used to coordinate the
movement of forces into their operational locations, almost like a baseball
team's batting order. The time-phased force and deployment data includes forces
from all Services and their movement requirements. A time-phased force and
deployment data contains critical information to include the time phasing of
forces by C-Dates to specific destinations (called routing data). Additionally,
through the use of unit type codes, this information includes personnel and
equipment details. A time-phased force and deployment data is a deployment
planning and execution tool containing live data that changes frequently.
Time-phased force and deployment data provide a prioritized list of what unit
type codes deploy in support of a particular plan, catalog combatant commander
requirements, route forces, and establish transportation requirements.
time-phased force and deployment data must be prioritized due to all Services
competing for the movement assets.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Installation Deployment Readiness Cell.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Centralized function aligned under the
Logistic Readiness Squadron commander and located within the Logistic Readiness
Squadron responsible for identifying, validating, and distributing deployment
taskings and information. The installation deployment readiness cell is the
day-to-day focal point for all deployment and execution operations. The
permanent staff consists of the installation deployment officer, Logistic
Readiness Squadron/Logistics Plans and Integration, and Force Support
Squadron/Personnel Readiness Flight personnel.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Installation Deployment Officer.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The designated military or federal civilian fully qualified
logistics readiness officer that acts on behalf of the host installation/wing
commander in directing, controlling, coordinating, and executing the deployment
of in-place (home station) and aggregated contingency forces and installation
deployment exercises (to include tenant units). Figure 4.1., provides the steps
involved within a tasking process.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.8.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Installation Personnel Readiness.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The Installation Personnel Readiness is an
office in the Force Support Squadron responsible for providing installation
wide personnel deployment planning and execution and personnel support in
matters pertaining to; deployment availability information, personnel
accountability, and duty status reporting for contingency, exercise, and
deployments. Installation Personnel Readiness responsibilities are covered in
the following five categories: planning, global command and control system,
accountability, deployment processing, and general.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.9.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Unit Deployment Manager.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The Unit Deployment Manager is appointed by the unit
commander to manage all deployment readiness and training aspects for
deployable personnel and equipment within their unit to ensure they are
deployment ready. In addition, unit deployment managers support redeployed
personnel in the redeployment support process, and serve as the primary liaison
to the unit training manager, flight/squadron leadership, wing training
functions regarding deployment related issues, and installation deployment
readiness cell.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.10.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>AEF Online.</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.10.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Commander's Toolkit.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Commander's Toolkit is a nonsecure internet protocol router-net
based system that provides information on deployment readiness, including
individual medical readiness data at the unit level for commanders via the
 Commander's Toolkit  tab on every page of AEF Online (nonsecure internet
protocol router). This tool was specifically built for base-level commanders,
unit deployment managers, and other key staff, to monitor and manage the
deployment status of their units and e-mail unit members with outstanding
requirements directly from the tool.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.10.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Personal Deployment Preparedness Tool.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The Personal Deployment Preparedness Tool
provides personalized information at the individual level for all uniformed
Airmen. The information provided includes; member's duty status, security
clearance, AEF Indicator, medical requirements (immunizations, medical
equipment, deployment availability codes, dental status, preventive health
assessment and laboratory requirements), and total force awareness training and
Basic Airman Readiness, expeditionary skills proficiency pre-deployment
training requirements extracted from the advanced distributed learning system.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.10.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>AEF Unit Type Code Reporting Tool.</span></b><span>&nbsp;AEF reporting tool measures AEF readiness
at the unit type code level. Force providers are involved in AEF reporting tool
reporting as AEF reporting tool monitors or as suppliers/receivers of AEF
reporting tool reporting information. AFI 10-244,&nbsp;<i>Reporting Status of
Aerospace Expeditionary Forces</i>, provides guideline for assessing and
reporting unit type code capabilities, reporting guidelines, and details daily
maintenance requirements. Through their unit AEF reporting tool monitors,
commanders report the ability of a unit type code to perform its mission
capability statement anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. AEF
reporting tool highlights missing resources and quantifies missing requirements
for additional justification when submitting budgets.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.10.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>AEF reporting tool is the only assessment system that reports at
the unit type code level and is the primary system used to source unit type
codes for taskings and contingencies. Commanders ensure AEF reporting tool is
accurate and up-to-date. Inaccurate AEF reporting tool reporting leads to
taskings that exceed capability, shortfalls/reclamas, delays in filling
combatant commander requirements, and Airmen receiving short-notice taskings.</span></p>

<p><span>4.10.4.10.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Commanders conduct two types of unit type code assessments in AEF
reporting tool: Readiness Assessments and Tasking Assessments. Readiness
stoplight assessments (Green, Yellow, or Red) indicate whether a unit type code
can perform its mission capability statement anywhere in the world at the time
of the assessment. To report accurately, commanders and unit AEF reporting tool
Monitors, who may also be the unit deployment manager, must know their unit
type codes requirements and the status of their personnel and equipment and
actions required to bring all unit type codes to  Green .</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 4D</span></i></b><b><span> <i>The Joint Force</i></span></b></p>

<p><b><span>4.11. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This section assists
Airmen to successfully operate as members of a joint team. Specifically, this
section discusses the foundations of joint doctrine, characterizes doctrine
governing unified direction of armed forces, outlines the functions of the
Department of Defense and its major components, describes the fundamental
principles for joint command and control, details doctrine for joint commands,
describes joint planning, provides guidance for multinational operations.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.12. Foundations of
Joint Doctrine.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Joint doctrine promotes
a common perspective from which to plan, train, and conduct military
operations. The foundations of joint doctrine represents what is taught,
believed, and advocated as what is right (that is, what works best). U.S.
military service is based on values that U.S. military experience has proven to
be vital for operational success.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.13. Fundamental Principles for Joint Command
and Control:</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.13.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Unity of command means all forces operate under a single commander
with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a
common purpose. Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and cooperation
among all forces toward a commonly recognized objective, although they are not
necessarily part of the same command structure.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The President and the Secretary of Defense exercise authority,
direction and control of the Armed Forces through two distinct branches of the
chain of command and control. The operational branch, used for executing
missions, runs from the President, through the Secretary of Defense to the
combatant commander. The operational branch includes the following types of
command authorities:</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Combatant command authority is the authority of a combatant
commander to perform those functions of command over assigned forces involving
organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military
operations, joint training (or in the case of U.S. special operations command,
training of assigned forces), and logistics necessary to accomplish the
missions assigned to the command. It cannot be delegated or transferred.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Operational control is the command authority that may be exercised
by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command and may
be delegated within the command. Operational control is inherent in combatant
command and is the authority to perform those functions of command over
subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces,
assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction
necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative
direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary
to accomplish missions assigned to the command; it does not include
authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline,
internal organization, or unit training.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Tactical control is the command authority over assigned or
attached forces or commands, or military capability or forces made available
for tasking that is limited to the detailed direction and control of movements
or maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish assigned
missions or tasks. Tactical control is inherent in operational control and may
be delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the
level of combatant command.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A support relationship is established by a superior commander
between subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, protect,
complement, or sustain another force. Support may be exercised by commanders at
any echelon at or below the combatant command level. This includes the
Secretary of Defense designating a support relationship between combatant
commanders as well as within a combatant command. The designation of supporting
relationships is important as it conveys priorities to commanders and staffs
that are planning or executing joint operations. The support command
relationship is, by design, a somewhat vague but very flexible arrangement. The
establishing authority (the common superior commander) is responsible for ensuring
that both the supported commander and supporting commanders understand the
degree of authority that the supported commander is granted.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.3<b>.</b>&nbsp;The
administrative branch of the chain of command, from the President through the
Secretary of Defense to the Secretaries of the military departments to the
service chiefs, provides the authority for the Secretary of the military
department to accomplish those functions and responsibilities of administration
and support described in 10 United States Code.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Administrative control is direction or exercise of authority over
subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support,
including organization of service forces, control of resources and equipment,
personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit training, readiness,
mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the
operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Administrative control is a service command authority, and flows
through service, not joint, channels. This authority is not an operational
command authority but provides the requisite authority for Services to execute
their individual  organize, train, and equip  functions.</span></p>

<p><span>4.13.4. All National
Guard and Reserve forces (except those specifically exempted) are assigned by
the Secretary of Defense to the combatant commands. However, those forces are
available for operational missions only when mobilized for specific periods, by
law, or when ordered to Regular Air Force after being validated for employment
by their parent service.</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.14. Joint Force Organization:</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.14.1. Joint forces are
established at three levels: unified commands, subordinate unified commands,
and joint task forces, and can be established on either a geographic area or
functional basis (Figure 4.2). These organizations are commanded by a joint
force commander. A joint force commander is a general term applied to a
combatant commander, subunified commander, or joint force commander authorized to
exercise combatant command (command authority) or operational control over a
joint force.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A unified command is a command with broad continuing missions
under a single commander, composed of forces from two or more military
departments, and established by the President, through the Secretary of
Defense, with the advice and assistance of the Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A specified command is a command that has broad continuing
missions and is established by the President, through the Secretary of Defense,
with the advice and assistance of the Chairman, Joint Chief of Staff.
Currently, there are no specified commands designated.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="566" height="230" src="afh1_files/image169.png" ></span></p>



<p><span>4.14.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>When authorized by the Secretary of Defense through the Chairman,
Joint Chief of Staff, commanders of unified commands may establish subordinate
unified commands to conduct operations on a continuing basis using the criteria
set forth for unified commands.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.1.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A joint task force is a joint force that is constituted and so
designated by the Secretary of Defense, a combatant commander, a subordinate
unified commander, or an existing joint task force commander. A joint task
force may be established on a geographical area or functional basis when the
mission has a specific limited objective and does not require overall
centralized control of logistics.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2. The key to
successful employment of Air Force forces as part of a joint force effort is
providing a single Air Force commander with the responsibility and authority to
properly organize, train, equip and employ Air Force forces to accomplish
assigned functions and tasks. The title of this commander is Commander, Air
Force Forces. Operationally, the Commander, Air Force Forces should be prepared
to employ Air Force forces as directed by the joint force commander, and if
directed be prepared to employ joint air forces as the joint force air
component commander. In either event, the Commander, Air Force Forces should
also ensure that Air Force forces are prepared to execute the missions assigned
by the joint force commander. The requirements and responsibilities of the
COMAFFOR and joint force air component commander are inextricably linked; both
are critical to operational success.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Although all Air Force units, regardless of level, have an Air
Force commander, the title of Commander, Air Force Forces is reserved
exclusively to the single Air Force commander of an Air Force Service component
assigned or attached to a joint force commander at the unified combatant
command, subordinate unified command, or joint task force level. The Secretary
of Defense/combatant commander may elect to permanently establish a subordinate
unified command or temporarily establish a subordinate joint task force as part
of his/her organizational structure. The commanders of these subordinate joint
forces are, by joint and Air Force doctrine, joint force commanders at a lower
level than the combatant commander. If Air Force forces are assigned or
attached to subordinate joint force commanders, that action creates an Air
Force Service component with a separate Commander, Air Force Forces directly
responsible to the appropriate joint force commander.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The Commander, Air Force Forces should normally be designated at a
command level above the operating forces and should not be dual-hatted as
commander of one of the subordinate operating units. This allows the Commander,
Air Force Forces to focus at the operational level of war, while subordinate
commanders lead their units at the tactical level.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The Commander, Air Force Forces commands the Air Force Service
component to the joint force commander. At the combatant command or subordinate
unified command level this is normally a standing permanently assigned
organization. At the joint task force level the Air Force Service component
will normally be an air expeditionary task force. At whatever level, the Air
Force Service component&nbsp; presents a joint force commander with a
task-organized, integrated package with the appropriate balance of force, sustainment,
control, and force protection. Every Air Force Service component presents a
scalable, tailorable organization with three elements: a single commander,
embodied in the Commander, Air Force Forces; appropriate command and control
mechanisms; and tailored and fully supported forces.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The air expeditionary task force will be tailored to the mission;
this includes not only forces, but also the ability to command and control
those forces for the missions assigned. When forming an air expeditionary task
force, the Commander, Air Force Forces should draw first from in-theater
resources, if available. If augmentation is needed, or if in-theater forces are
not available, the Air Force will draw as needed from the AEF currently on
rotation. These forces, whether in-theater or deployed from out of theater,
should be fully supported with the requisite maintenance, logistical support,
health services, and administrative elements. These forces will form up within
the air expeditionary task force as expeditionary wings, groups, squadrons,
flights, detachments, or elements, as necessary to provide reasonable spans of
control and command elements at appropriate levels and to provide unit
identity.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Air expeditionary task force command and control mechanisms are in
place and are usually known as an air operations center. An air operations
center may be regional or functional, aligning with the purpose of the unified
command they support. The Commander, Air Force Forces requires command
activities as tools to assist in exercising operational control, tactical
control, and administrative control. The Commander, Air Force Forces uses an
air operations center to exercise control of air and space operations, and a
service component staff (commonly called the Air Force forces staff) to
exercise support operations and administrative control. The character of the
operations center may vary, depending on the nature of the forces. For air
mobility operations, the operations center may be the 618th Air Operations
Center (formerly the Tanker Airlift Control Center) at Scott Air Force Base,
while space operations would leverage the 614th Air Operations Center at
Vandenberg Air Force Base.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>An air expeditionary task force also needs a command entity
responsible for the deployment and sustainment of Air Force forces. The Air
Force forces staff is the mechanism through which the Commander, Air Force
Forces exercises service responsibilities. These sustainment activities are
sometimes referred to as  beds, beans, and bullets.  The Air Force forces staff
is also responsible for the long-range planning and theater engagement
operations that fall outside the air operation center's current operational
focus.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.2.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The core capabilities of the air operations center and Air Force
forces staff should be well-established, but tailored in size and function
according to the theater and the operation. Not all operations require a
full-up air operations center with over 1,000 people or a large Air Force
forces staff. Smaller operations, such as some humanitarian operations, can
make do with a small control center that does little more than scheduling and
reporting.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.3. Combatant
commanders and commanders of subordinate unified commands and joint task force
commanders have the authority to establish functional component commands to
control military operations (Figure 4.3). Joint force commanders may decide to
establish a functional component command to integrate planning; reduce their
span of control; and/or significantly improve combat efficiency, information
flow, unity of effort, weapon systems management, component interaction, and
control over the scheme of maneuver.</span></p>

<p><sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup><b><span>Figure 4.3. Joint Force Organization with Functional and Service
Component Commanders.</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="566" height="460" src="afh1_files/image170.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>4.14.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If air assets from more than one service are present within a
joint force, the joint force commander normally will designate a joint force
air component commander to exploit the full capabilities of joint air
operations. The a joint force air component commander should be the service
component commander with the preponderance of air capabilities and the ability
to plan, task, and control joint air operations. If working with allies in a
coalition or alliance operation, the joint force air component commander may be
designated as the combined force air component commander. Both joint and U.S.
Air Force doctrine state that one individual will normally be dual-hatted as
commander, Air Force forces and a joint force air component commander/combined
force air component commander. The U.S. Air Force prefers<b> </b>and in fact,
plans and trains<b> </b>to employ through a commander, Air Force forces who is
then prepared to assume responsibilities as aa joint force air component
commander if so designated. The joint force air component commander recommends
the proper employment of air forces from multiple components. The a joint force
air component commander also plans, coordinates, allocates tasks, executes, and
assesses air and space operations to accomplish assigned operational missions.
Because of the wide scope of air operations, the joint force air component
commander will typically maintain the same joint operating area/theater-wide
perspective as the joint force commander. The joint force air component
commander, as with any component commander, should not also be dual-hatted as
the joint force commander.</span></p>

<p><span>4.14.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Functional component commanders normally exercise tactical control
of forces made available to them by the joint force commander. Thus, a
Commander, Air Force Forces exercises operational control of Air Force forces
and, acting as a joint force air component commander, normally exercises
tactical control of any Navy, Army, Marine, and coalition air assets made
available for tasking (i.e., those forces not retained for their own service s
organic operations).</span></p>

<p><b><span>4.15. Joint Operation Planning.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Joint operation planning
consists of planning activities associated with joint military operations by
combatant commanders and their subordinate joint force commanders in response
to contingencies and crises. Joint operation planning transforms national
strategic objectives into activities by development of operational products
that include planning for the mobilization, deployment, employment,
sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization of joint forces. Furthermore,
joint operation planning ties the military instrument of national power to the
achievement of national security goals and objectives and is essential to
securing strategic end states across the range of military operations. Planning
begins with the end state in mind, providing a unifying purpose around which
actions and resources are focused.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Joint operation planning provides a common basis for discussion,
understanding, and change for the joint force, its subordinate and higher
headquarters, the joint planning and execution community, and the national
leadership. The APEX system facilitates iterative dialogue and collaborative
planning between the multiple echelons of command to ensure that the military
instrument of national power is employed in accordance with national priorities,
and that the plan is continuously reviewed and updated as required and adapted
according to changes in strategic guidance, resources, or the operational
environment. Joint operation planning also identifies capabilities outside
Department of Defense required for achieving the strategic objectives to reach
the end state by providing a forum that facilitates the inter-organizational
coordination that enables unified action.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The APEX system operates in a networked, collaborative
environment, which facilitates dialogue among senior leaders, concurrent and
parallel plan development, and collaboration across multiple planning levels.
The joint planning and execution community uses the APEX system to monitor,
plan, and execute mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment,
redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations.
Clear strategic guidance and frequent interaction between senior leaders and
planners promote early understanding of, and agreement on, planning assumptions,
considerations, risks, and other key factors.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In peacetime, combatant commanders develop campaign plans to
delineate their strategies for ongoing, steadystate operations intended to
deliver continuing strategic advantage to the U.S. and its allies. Planners
develop branch and sequel plans to these campaign plans to cover particular
potential contingencies within their areas of responsibility. These contingency
plans can be elaborated into one of four levels of detail, each with characteristic
planning products:</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Commander's Estimate</span></b><span>. Produces multiple potential courses of action to address the
contingency and complete the mission. It contains the supported commander s
evaluation of the potential courses of action along with a recommended courses
of action.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Base Plan</span></b><span>. This describes a
concept of operations that addresses the contingency, based on a selected
course of action. It identifies major forces involved, the concept of support,
and anticipated timelines for completing the mission (often expressed in  lines
of effort ). It normally does not contain annexes or timephased force
deployment data.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.3.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Concept of Plan</span></b><span>.
This is an operation plan in abbreviated format. It normally includes a plan
summary, a base plan, and several crucial annexes (such as those delineating
command relations and interagency coordination requirements.). It may or may
not include a time-phased force deployment data.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.3.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operation Plan</span></b><span>.
A complete and detailed joint plan containing a comprehensive description of
the concept of operations, including identification of specific forces,
functional support, and resources required; all annexes applicable to the plan;
and a time-phased force deployment data. It can be quickly developed in to an
operation order.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4. In a crisis, the
joint planning and execution community employs combat air patrol to accomplish
planning in a time-sensitive manner, producing orders that describe the
mission, situation, and objectives; establish command relationships; identify
planning assumptions; and identify and/or task forces and strategic mobility
resources, or request them. The types of joint operation orders are:</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Warning Order</span></b><span>.
Initiates development and evaluation of course of actions by supported
commander. Requests commander's estimate.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Planning Order</span></b><span>.
Begins execution planning for a particular course of action. Directs
preparation of an operation order or contingency plan. Conveys anticipated
course of action selection by the President or Secretary of Defense.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Alert Order</span></b><span>.
Begins execution planning for a selected course of action, directing
preparation of and operation order or contingency plan. Conveys course of
action selection by the President or Secretary of Defense.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Prepare to Deploy Order</span></b><span>. Increases or decreases deployability posture of units.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Deployment (or Redeployment) Order</span></b><span>. Deploys or redeploys forces, increases
deployability posture, establishes a joint task force, and/or establishes a
C-day/L-hour (day or hour on which the deployment operation commences).</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Execute Order</span></b><span>.
Implements the President's or Secretary of Defense's decision to execute a
course of action or operation order.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Operation Order</span></b><span>.
Directs the coordinated execution of an operation. Issued by a commander to
subordinate commanders.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.4.8.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Fragmentary Order</span></b><span>. Issued as needed to change or modify an operation order
execution.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5. Planning is
conducted at every echelon of command and across the range of military
operations. Joint operation planning employs an integrated process for orderly
analytical, and coordinated problem solving and decision-making known as the
joint operation planning process. In its peacetime application, the process is
highly structured to support the thorough and fully coordinated development of
deliberate plans. In crisis, the process can be shortened as needed to support
the dynamic requirements of changing events. In wartime, the process adapts to
accommodate greater decentralization of joint operation planning activities.
Joint operation planning process consists of a set of logical steps to examine
a mission; develop, analyze, and compare alternative course of actions, select
the best course of action, develop a concept of operations, and produce a plan
or order.&nbsp;<b>Joint operation planning process is thus the process
used to derive all the types of plans and many of the orders described above.</b>&nbsp;<b>Joint
operation planning process is also the process used to derive subordinate plans
for employment and support of forces, including those created for use by Air
Force forces.&nbsp;</b>Joint operation planning process consists of seven
steps:</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Planning Initiation</span></b><span>. An appropriate authority (such as the President, Secretary of
Defense, or combatant commander) recognizes potential for employing military
capability in a particular contingency or crisis and decides to develop
military options.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mission Analysis</span></b><span>. A crucial output of this step is the mission statement: The
joint force's mission is the task, or set of tasks, together with the purpose,
that indicates the action to be taken and the reason for doing so. Key mission
analysis activities include such things as review of initial planning guidance
and intelligence; developing the mission statement; determining known facts and
developing planning assumptions; conducting an initial force allocation review;
and developing mission success criteria (measures of effectiveness for the
mission). Mission analysis concludes with a mission analysis brief to the
commander and involves approval of the mission statement.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Course of Action Development</span></b><span>. A course of action is a potential way (solution, method) to
accomplish the assigned mission. Staffs develop course of actions to provide
unique choices to the commander, all oriented on accomplishing the military end
state. course of actions describe&nbsp;<i>who</i>&nbsp;will take action,&nbsp;<i>what
type</i>&nbsp;of military action will take place,&nbsp;<i>when&nbsp;</i>the
action will occur,&nbsp;<i>where</i>&nbsp;the action will occur,&nbsp;<i>why&nbsp;</i>the
action is required (the purpose), and&nbsp;<i>how&nbsp;</i>the action will take
place (the method of employment of forces). Each course of action should
explain the objectives, end state, key tasks, and task organization.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Course of Action Analysis</span></b><span>. This step closely examines potential course of actions to reveal
details that will allow the commander and staff to evaluate them in order to
identify advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; The primary means of conducting
this analysis is wargaming. Wargaming is a conscious effort to visualize the
flow of an operation, given friendly and adversary dispositions, capabilities,
strengths, and possible course of actions. A critical element of wargaming is
the  red team/cell,  which role-plays and models the adversary, aggressively
pursuing the adversary's point of view and objectives. Wargaming can be as
simple as a turn-byturn table-top affair, or as complex as a Department of
Defense-adjudicated game hosted on mainframe computers. Wargaming allows the
planning staff and commander to asses each course of action for feasibility  to
answer questions like,  can it be supported?   Is more combat capability need? 
 Can the adversary effectively counter or prevent friendly action?  The outputs
of this step feed the next:</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Course of Action Comparison</span></b><span>. Comparison is a subjective process whereby the course of action
are independently evaluated against a set of criteria established by the
commander and staff. This step should identify and recommend the course of
action that has the greatest probability of success against the adversary
course of action that is of most concern to the commander. Often, the staff
develops an evaluation matrix that compares all the friendly course of action
against the established set of criteria; this may help identify the best course
of action. Ultimately, the staff develops a brief recommending their selection
for  best  course of action.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Course of Action Approval</span></b><span>. In this step, the staff briefs the commander on the course of
action comparison and wargaming results and recommends a course of action for
approval.&nbsp; The commander may approve the course of action or modify it, or
direct the staff to reiterate portions of the joint operation planning
process.&nbsp; From the final course of action selection, the commander and
staff prepare a commander's estimate (previously described) and direct further
plan or order development.</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.5.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Plan or Order Development</span></b><span>. The commander's staff and subordinate functional or Service
component staffs develop more detailed plans, supporting plans, or orders, as
required by the mission (and as described above).</span></p>

<p><span>4.15.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For further information concerning the joint force and planning,
see Joint Publication 5-0,&nbsp;<i>Joint Operation Planning.</i></span></p>

<p><span>4.15.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Subordinate and supporting commands and staffs use the JOPP
process to create their own plans and orders.&nbsp;<b>When the Air Force
Service component or the joint force air component accomplish this process, it
is known as the joint operation planning process for air</b>. When the joint
force air component accomplishes the joint operation planning process for air,
it produces a plan known as the joint air operations plan, or joint air
operations plan.&nbsp; During execution, the joint air operations plan is
divided into time-defined (usually daily)  slices' known as air operation
directives.&nbsp; Air operation directives, then, are the basis for the daily
air tasking orders, which govern accomplishment of the air tasking and
targeting cycles the mechanisms of joint air employment of forces. Following
execution, these cycles guide the staffs and commander through assessment of
operations:  Are we doing the right things and are we doing things right in
order to accomplish the mission?   What is our progress toward accomplishment? 
The Air Force Service component produces an Air Force Service component plan to
support the joint force air component and the joint force overall. Most all of
the planning described in this paragraph takes place in the air operations
center, or air operation center, although some Service component planning may
take place elsewhere.&nbsp; For more information on Air Force and air component
planning, see Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-0,&nbsp;<i>Operations and Planning</i>.&nbsp;<b><i>Section

<p><b><span>4.16. Joint and Coalition Capabilities:</span></b></p>

<p><span>4.16.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As our Nation and armed forces are confronted with a multitude of
priorities, from a shrinking force and limited resources, to fiscal
constraints, we must be mindful to advance only the necessary resources to
ensure that the right capabilities are integrated and interoperable across all
domains of air, space, and cyberspace. Competing priorities today must now be
carefully measured against all military capabilities, ensuring that quality not
necessarily quantity smartly contributes to a faster, more flexible, agile and
response force. That said, we must rely on the strengths of others, or be
interdependent, and meanwhile ensure all capabilities can effectively
intertwine, or be interoperable with each other to achieve an overarching
objective. One of the founding initiatives, which addressed joint
interdependence and joint interoperability, was the Goldwater-Nichols
Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>One of the first successful operational actions of combining joint
and coalition integration was experienced during Operations DESERT SHIELD and
DESERT STORM. These operations demonstrated an unmistakable fashion the value
and effectiveness of joint and combined military operations. The unique
capabilities of each of the U.S. military Services, and those of each of our
allies, were exploited during various phases of both operations. The combined
force provided a synergistic combat capability which brought the greatest
possible military power of the coalition force to bear against the opponent.
Likewise, our experience also reaffirmed the importance of joint and combined
training, the value of forward presence and the validity of joint force
sequencing for power-projection. A good example of this was through the use of
the Air Force's domain of space. After the Gulf War there was a near unanimous
agreement that space-based systems greatly increased the overall effectiveness
of coalition forces.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Clearly, history proved that collectively, the strengths,
resources, and training of one Service or nation in today's increasingly
complex environment, increases and/or balances the successful outcome of a
military objective. This was seen in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan throughout
all aspects of the global war on terrorism and through other worldwide security
challenges.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The U.S. Air Force's unity of effort, through the application of
air, space, and cyberspace, provides unique capabilities that bridge a
comprehensive joint and coalition approach. This unity of effort involves the
coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants
are not necessarily part of the same command or organization, but the product
of successful unified action (Joint Publication 1-02).</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Our doctrine continues to evolve; we now rarely see any one
Service or any one country unilaterally plan, organize, or execute an
operation, but we see inclusiveness with joint, coalition, and sometimes
interagency partners, whereby we depend on each other to succeed in today s
complex environment. Through this interdependence we are able to select the
right resources and capabilities from each other. These capabilities simply do
not get used when a contingency arises, but are synergized and tested through
such venues as exercises and operations to ensure all joint, and when
necessary, coalition partners can meet the desired objectives at the right time
and right place.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Each Service and coalition brings a unique balance to every
operation and, depending upon the circumstances, the balance may shift from one
Service or nation due to the different operating environments and applications
necessary to support the best options. Our Air Force tenet of centralized
control, decentralized execution is a great example of this. When employing
strategic air attack as a line of operations, which defines the interior or
exterior orientation of the force in relation to the enemy or that connects
actions on nodes and/or decisive points related in time and space to an
objective, we will require a high degree of centralization under an air
commander, known as the joint force air component commander. The joint force
air component commander must have authority over all forces, foreign or
domestic, to direct operations, including attack sequencing and make
adjustments as operations unfold. On the contrary, if tactical air operations
are necessary to support ground troops using close air support, these air
resources are best when decentralized to support ground commanders. The tenet
of Airpower is never prosecuted alone, but space and cyberspace, which belongs
to no one state, remains a vital imperative for joint force operations.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A good example of this was played out during Operation ODYSSEY
DAWN over Libya in 2011. During this operation, the joint and combined
operations provided one of the greatest uses of joint and coalition
capabilities in our recent history. In an effort to support multi-national
efforts necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attacks by the regime of
Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi, the U.S. Africa Command task force was
assigned to provide operational and tactical command and control of U.S.
military forces supporting the international response to the unrest in Libya
and enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. At the
start of operations, U.S. Africa Command, commanded by General Carter Ham,
exercised strategic command. Tactical command in the theater of operations was
executed from USS&nbsp;<i>Mount Whitney&nbsp;</i>in the Mediterranean Sea under
supported command of Admiral Sam Locklear, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Africa.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates indicated that control of the operation
would be transferred to French and British authorities, or North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, within days. The Joint Task Force was called Joint Task
Force ODYSSEY DAWN.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.8.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As a joint team, the supporting commands (commanders) were the
Joint Force Maritime Component Commander Vice Admiral Harry B. Harris who
controlled maritime assets aboard the USS&nbsp;<i>Mount Whitney,</i>&nbsp;and
Joint Force Air Component Commander Major General Margaret Woodward.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.9.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As the Libyans began joining other Arab populations across North Africa
in conducting antigovernment protests and demonstrations, time passed and the
Qadhafi regime increasingly began to use military force against its citizens in
efforts to repress the uprising. The Arab League meeting in Cairo asked the
United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect
civilians from air attack and declaring that the Qadhafi government had lost
its sovereignty. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1973
authorizing all necessary measures to protect civilians in Libya. The
resolution authorized the use of force and the enforcement of a no-fly zone
over Libya. The U.S. Secretary of Defense approved and ordered the use of U.S.
military forces in strikes against the government of Libya. The International
Coalition took measures to begin enforcement of United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1973, to include the imposition of a no-fly zone, launched strikes
against Libyan military sites and air defense systems.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.10.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>To illustrate effective interdependence and interoperability, the
following joint and coalition capabilities over</span></p>

<p><span>Libya was a good
example. The following representation was captured within the first few days of
Operation</span></p>

<p><span>ODYSSEY DAWN:</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.10.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As Major General Woodward commanded the air campaign, French
aircraft destroyed four Libyan tanks in air strikes to the southwest of the
city of Benghazi. The French military claimed that its aircraft had also flown
reconnaissance missions over all Libyan territory. On the same day, British
Prime Minister David Cameron confirmed that Royal Air Force jets were also in
action and reports suggested that the U.S. Navy had fired the first cruise
missile. CBS News correspondent David Martin reported that three B-2 stealth
bombers from Whiteman Air Force base Missouri flew nonstop from the U.S. to
drop 40 bombs on a major Libyan airfield. Martin further reported that U.S.
fighter jets were searching for Libyan ground forces to attack. The Pentagon
and the British Ministry of Defense confirmed that, jointly, British ship
HMS&nbsp;<i>Triumph&nbsp;</i>and U.S. Navy ships (including USS&nbsp;<i>Barry</i>)
and submarines fired more than 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, supported with air
attacks on military installations, both inland and on the coast. Days later,
several Storm Shadow missiles were launched by British jets. Nineteen U.S.
planes conducted strike operations in Libya. The planes included Marine Corps
AV-8B Harriers, U.S. Navy EA-18G Growlers, which were diverted from operations
over Iraq and jammed Libyan radar and communications, and Air Force F-15 and
F-16 fighter jets. A military convoy was destroyed south of Benghazi by air
strikes. Seventy military vehicles were destroyed and multiple loyalist ground
troop casualties were also reported. Four Danish F-16 fighters left Italy s
Sigonella Air Base for a successful 5-hour long high-risk mission, and four
Italian Tornados (electronic combat/reconnaissance), accompanied by four
Italian aircraft. Operations continued and on 31 March 2011 at 0600 Greenwich
Mean Time, North Atlantic Treaty Organization took command of all operations in
Libya with subsequent operations being conducted as part of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization-driven operation unified protector.</span></p>

<p><span>4.16.10.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Operation ODYSSEY DAWN was a complete success and supported the
necessity of, not only joint and coalition capabilities, but how air, space,
and cyberspace domains intertwined all facets of the operation to guarantee
success. General Dempsey said it best when he stated [Joint and
Coalition]&nbsp;<b><i> means building and presenting forces that can be molded
to context not just by adding and subtracting, but by leaders combining
capabilities in innovative ways. It means interdependence services that rely on
each other to achieve objectives and create capabilities that do not exist
except when combined. It means a regionally postured, but globally networked
and flexible force that can be scaled and scoped to demand. </i></b></span></p>

<p><span>4.16.11. Today, not one
military contingency or operation, whether in peacetime or wartime, can
optimize its objective without space or cyberspace. Airpower offers speed,
agility, flexibility, range, and responsiveness to virtually every need, and
airpower has demonstrated its success to meet our homeland and international
security challenges by leveraging our respective capabilities and maximizing
resulting synergy. Cyber operations guarantee our capability to operate in any
contested cyber domain to support vital land, sea, air, and space missions by
developing capabilities to protect essential military cyber systems and to
speed their recovery if an attack does occur. In these interdependent domains
the Air Force possesses unique capabilities for ensuring global mobility,
long-range strike, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The
benefits of airpower extend beyond the air domain, and operations among the
air, land, maritime, space, and cyber domains are increasingly interdependent
upon each other for the success of any and all national military objectives.
Together, the domains of air, space, and cyberspace, effectively combined with
joint and coalition capabilities, has proven to be the most valuable means of
supporting the National Security Strategy of the U.S. and our allies.</span></p>

maintenance of plans and rapid development of effective options through
adaptation of approved operation plans during crisis. Joint operation planning
allows for the effective management of operations in execution across the
spectrum of mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment and
demobilization. Joint operation planning is supported by a networked suite of
automated data processing applications, tools, and databases, which reside on
the Global Command and Control System. Joint operation planning and execution

<p align="center"><b><span>EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 5A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>5.1.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The ability of the
United States Air Force to carry out its mission of Global Vigilance, Global
Reach, and Global Power directly depends on continuance of the mission in the
face of adversity. Challenges to mission accomplishment take many forms ranging
from natural disasters, man-made incidents, terrorist use of weapons of mass
destruction, and hostile attacks that threaten United States interests. The Air
Force Emergency Management Program was developed to ensure the readiness of our
Total Force to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the effects of
incidents that endanger the lives of personnel and jeopardize mission
accomplishment. Airmen may be called upon to serve the program in a variety of
ways; from attending localized emergency preparedness briefings to being a
member of a specialized team. In today's threat-laden environment, every Airman
must play their part to ensure their installation has a successful Emergency
Management program.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 5B Emergency
Management Program and Air Force Incident Management System</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>5.2.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Air
Force Emergency Management Program.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Protection of personnel
and operational resources is essential to successful Air Force operations. The
Air Force Emergency Management program develops and implements measures for,
and manages activities related to, emergency preparedness, incident management,
response and recovery operations, chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear defense, and consequence management.</span></p>

<p><span>5.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The primary mission of the Air Force Emergency Management Program
is to save lives; minimize the loss or degradation of resources; and continue,
sustain, and restore operational capability in an all-hazards physical threat
environment at Air Force installations worldwide.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The ancillary missions
are to support homeland defense and civil support operations and to provide
support to civil and host nation authorities according to Department of Defense
publications and through the appropriate combatant command. These missions are
accomplished using the Air Force Incident Management System, which employs the
installation disaster response force, as the structure for all responses.</span></p>

<p><span>5.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The Air Force Emergency Management Program contributes to mission
assurance, which is defined as the process to protect or ensure the continued
function and resilience of capabilities and assets including personnel,
equipment, facilities, networks, information, and information systems,
infrastructure, and supply chains in any operating environment or condition,
and the continuation of mission essential functions necessary to perform the
operations of the installation in support of the national military strategy.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.3. The Five Emergency Management Mission
Areas.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force Emergency
Management program mission areas (Figure 5.1.) include prevention, protection,
response, recovery, and mitigation. They are met through preparedness, which
includes actions to plan, organize, equip, train, and exercise prior to
disasters and incidents.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 5.1. Mission
Areas.</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>5.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Prevention.&nbsp;</b>Prevention
includes the capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened or
actual act of terrorism.</span></p>

<p><span>5.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Protection.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Protection provides the capabilities necessary to protect the
installation against all threats and hazards, and manmade or natural disasters.</span></p>

<p><span>5.3.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Response.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Response includes
actions taken to save lives, protect property, and mitigate the effects of an
incident.</span></p>

<p><span>5.3.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Recovery.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Recovery includes
operations such as implementing casualty treatment, unexploded explosive
ordnance safing, personnel and resource decontamination, airfield damage
repair, and facility restoration. Response contains three essential elements;
notification, response, and protective actions.</span></p>

<p><span>5.3.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mitigation.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Mitigation
comprises the capabilities necessary to reduce the loss of life and property by
lessening the impact of future disasters. These capabilities are designed to
reduce or eliminate risks to persons or property or to lessen the actual or
potential effects or consequences of a disaster or incident.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.4.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Air
Force Incident Management System.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Emergency Management
program accomplishes its mission through the Air Force Incident Management
System which utilizes the disaster response force. Air Force Incident
Management System aligns Emergency Management planning and response with
Homeland Security Directive 5,&nbsp;<i>Management of Domestic Incidents;&nbsp;</i>the
National Incident Management System; the National Response Framework, and
Office of the Secretary of Defense guidance while preserving unique military
requirements. The system provides the Air Force with a single, comprehensive
approach to incident management while allowing scalable and flexible response
options to organize field-level operations for a broad spectrum of emergencies.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.5.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Air
Force Emergency Management Structure.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force Emergency Management program has two structural elements; a strategic
planning and management staff to maintain the Emergency Management program and
a disaster response force to manage or conduct incident response operations
(Figure 5.2.). The planning and management staff provide an overall
cross-functional installation risk management program for developing threat and
hazard plans and budget, and is comprised of four functions; the office of
emergency management, unit emergency management representatives, the emergency
management working group, and the wing inspection team. See AFI 10-2501,&nbsp;<i>Air
Force Emergency Management Program</i>, for definitions of planning and
management functions. The disaster response force are the organizational
functions that respond to disasters or accidents to establish command and
control and support disaster operations. The disaster response force includes
the Crisis Action Team, Emergency Operations Center, unit control centers,
Command Post, incident commander, first and emergency responders, and
specialized and support recovery teams.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Crisis Action Team. Structure   Disaster
Response Force.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Crisis Action Team
directs strategic actions supporting the installation's mission. This team is
activated to provide a command, control, and communication link to higher
headquarters and comparable civilian agencies and to coordinate the incident
response.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Emergency Operations Center.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Emergency Operations Center is the command and control support element that
coordinates information and resources to the installation actions before,
during, and after an incident.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Unit Control Center.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Unit control centers
provide response and recovery support to the Incident Commander as directed by
the Emergency Operations Center and mission support to the installation
commander as directed by Crisis Action Team. Unit control centers provide&nbsp;</span><sub><span>&nbsp;</span></sub><span>a focal point within an
organization to maintain unit command and control, relay information to and
from unit personnel, provide expertise to the emergency operations center or
the incident commander, and leverage unit resources to respond to and mitigate
the incident.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Command Post.</span></b></p>

<p><span>As a command and control
node, the command post assists in directing installation emergency management
and response actions. The command post maintains notification rosters, provides
and collects information from the unit control centers, and coordinates with
the crisis action team and the Emergency Operations Center.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Incident Commander.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The incident commander
is a trained and experienced responder that provides on-scene tactical control
using subject matter experts and support from other functions. Fire Emergency
Services is the incident commander for all incidents involving two or more
response agencies.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>First Responders.</span></b></p>

<p><span>First responders deploy
immediately to the scene to provide initial command and control, to save lives,
and to suppress and control hazards. First responders include fire and
emergency services, security forces, and medical personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Emergency Responders.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Emergency responders
deploy after the first responders to expand command and control and provide
additional support. Emergency responders include emergency management,
explosive ordnance disposal, bioenvironmental engineering personnel and may
include other subject matter experts.</span></p>

<p><span>5.5.8.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Specialized and Support Recovery Teams.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Specialized teams are
formed from the existing installation and unit personnel resources to support
emergency response operations. Specialized teams include the emergency
management support team, shelter management team, contamination control team,
post-attack reconnaissance team, and other specialized teams.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 5C Protective
Measures and Response Procedures</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>5.6.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Protective
Measures.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Threats and hazards that
may affect your installation could be natural, man-made, or technological.
Disasters or incidents resulting from a threat or hazard can occur at any time
with little or no advance warning. These incidents can be local or widespread,
predictable or unpredictable. There are ways to prepare for and cope with these
events, regardless of the type of incident. Take time to think; then act
according to the situation. Installations, as well as individuals, need to
identify local threats and hazards, prepare early, and develop emergency plans.
For preparation guidance, contact the installation readiness and emergency
management flight and visit the Air Force  Be Ready  website (</span><a href="http://www.beready.af.mil/"><span>http://www.beready.af.mil/</span></a><a href="http://www.beready.af.mil/"><span>)</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.7.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Air
Force Emergency Notification Signals.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Every Air Force
installation must have a rapid and effective system to quickly disseminate
emergency information such as watches, warnings, evacuation routes, and protective
actions. When a disaster or incident affecting the base is imminent or
inprogress, personnel must respond to directions communicated over mass
notification and warning systems (Figure 5.3). These messages may be visual or
audible. Make sure you know how notifications and warnings are executed at your
installation to ensure you are promptly informed and ready to properly respond
to local emergencies.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="566" height="253" src="afh1_files/image173.jpg" ></span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 5.3. U.S. Air Force Emergency
Notification Signals.</span></b></p>



<p><b><span>5.8.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Personnel
Sheltering.</span></b></p>

<p><span>All installations are
required to conduct threat-based shelter planning. Shelter selection is based
on structural and personnel housing capabilities in relation to the types of
disasters. Personnel must know where their shelter is located and understand
shelter-processing procedures. Shelter-in-place is used to provide temporary
protection in a structure for short or no-notice emergencies, such as hazardous
material incident or a tornado, when the type or extent of the hazard is
unknown and/or evacuation at the time would be dangerous. Active shooter
lock-down procedures are not the same as those used for shelter-inplace. Refer
to AFMAN 10-2502,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Incident Management Standards and
Procedures</i>, for shelter planning information. Wartime sheltering addressed
in paragraph 5.17.4 and AFMAN 10-2503,&nbsp;<i>Operations in a Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE)
Environment</i>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.9.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Response
Procedures.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Commanders must be able
to maintain the primary installation mission, save lives, mitigate damage, and
restore missionessential resources following disasters or incidents. Response
levels will depend on the magnitude of the incident and degree of damage. Each
installation must develop disaster response plans and policies to address local
threats and hazards. The installation emergency management plan 10-2 is the
vehicle for installation planning and response. The plan provides comprehensive
guidance for emergency response to natural (geological, meteorological, and
biological hazards), human-caused (accidental and intentional) or technological
incidents. These categories are detailed in the following sections.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 5D   Natural
Disaster, Man-Made Physical and Technological Hazards</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>5.10.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Natural
Disasters.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Natural disasters and
severe weather can create emergency conditions that vary widely in scope,
urgency, and degree of damage and destruction. The installations must develop
plans for the hazards likely to affect their location. Specific actions taken
in response, mitigation, and recovery will vary. A national-level response may
be required to help an Air Force installation recover from large-area natural
disasters.</span></p>

<p><span>5.10.1. Natural
disasters are categorized as geological, meteorological, or biological hazards.
Natural geological hazards include earthquake, tsunami, volcano, landslide, and
mudslide, subsidence (i.e. sinkholes, glacier, and iceberg). Natural
meteorological hazards include: flood, flash flood, tidal surge, drought, fire,
snow, ice, hail, sleet, avalanche, windstorm, tropical cyclone, hurricane,
tornado, water spout, dust or sand storm, extreme temperature (heat, cold),
lightning strikes, and geomagnetic storm. Natural biological hazards include
diseases that impact humans or animals such as plague, anthrax, botulism, smallpox,
tularemia, viral hemorrhagic fevers, West Nile Virus, foot and mouth diseases,
severe acute respiratory syndrome, and pandemic disease.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.11. Human Caused Hazards.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Installations are
threatened with the possibility of catastrophic man-made hazards, whether
accidental or intentional. All installations must prepare for, and quickly
respond to major accidents to prevent the loss of life, preserve valuable
resources, and protect the environment.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.1. The Department
of Defense is responsible for responding to incidents involving its resources
or resulting from Department of Defense activities. The military installation,
regardless of size, nearest the scene of the accident or incident will respond
to the event unless otherwise directed by higher headquarters. Upon witnessing
an accident or incident, personnel should alert others in the immediate area
and report the incident to security forces, fire and emergency services, or
installation command and control. After reporting the accident, personnel should:</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Stay uphill and upwind. Avoid inhaling fumes, smoke, or vapors.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Attempt to rescue and care for casualties.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Avoid handling any material or component involved in the
accident/incident.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.1.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Evacuate the area if rescue or containment is impractical, or if
directed to evacuate.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Man-Made Accidental.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Man-made accidental
incidents include hazardous materials (for example, explosive, flammable
liquid, flammable gas, flammable solid, oxidizer, poison, radiological, corrosive)
spill or release. An explosion or fire; transportation accident; building or
structure collapse; energy, power, or utility failure; fuel or resource
shortage; air or water pollution or contamination; dam, levee, or other water
control structure failure; financial issues including economic depression,
inflation, financial system collapse; and communication system interruption.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Man-Made
Intentional.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Man-made intentional
incidents include terrorism, sabotage, civil disturbance, public unrest, riot,
strike or labor dispute, disinformation, criminal activity (vandalism, arson,
theft, fraud, embezzlement, and data theft), electromagnetic pulse, physical or
information security breach, active shooter, and product defect or
contamination. An overview of man-made intentional incidents involving enemy or
terrorist use chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear is provided in
Section 5E.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.3.1. An active
shooter is an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill
people, most often in populated areas. In most cases, active shooters use
firearms and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims. In
some cases, active shooters use improvised explosive devices to create
additional victims and impede first responders.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.3.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Lockdown is declared to protect personnel from an Active Shooter
incident and is a base-wide protective action used to restrict the movement of
personnel and to aid law enforcement first responders in neutralizing the
shooting suspect as quickly as possible. During lockdown, no person may exit or
enter another area until the all clear is broadcasted; unless movement is
required to escape from a dangerous place or situation.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.3.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you find yourself involved in an active shooter situation, remain
calm, quickly determine the most reasonable way to protect your own life. If an
escape route is accessible, evacuate the immediate area. If evacuation is not
possible, find a place to create a barricade between you and the active
shooter. As a last resort, and only when your life is in imminent danger,
attempt to disrupt and/or incapacitate the shooter.</span></p>

<p><span>5.11.4.<b>&nbsp;Technological.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Technologically caused

<p><b><span>5.12.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Hazards.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear, as well as toxic industrial material, hazards cause
adverse effects through deliberate release and dissemination. Installation
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear defense requires an
installationwide team that includes all personnel to plan, prepare, respond and
recover from a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear incident.
Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear preparedness and defense
measures are intended to balance mission continuation with force survivability
to maximize mission effectiveness within a chemical, biological, radiological,
and nuclear environment. An awareness of the hazards and protective actions
will help you protect yourself in the event of a chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear attack.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.13.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Threat Agents.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Each chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threat agent presents a unique hazard.
Airmen should know the importance of understanding what the characteristics,
symptoms, and protective factors are for all chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear threat agents relative to the deployed location.</span></p>

<p><span>5.13.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Chemical.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Chemical
agents are chemical substances that are intended for use in military operations
to kill, seriously injure, or incapacitate mainly through their physiological
effects. Chemical agents are categorized according to their physiological
effects: lung damaging agents (choking), blister agents, blood agents,
incapacitating agents, and nerve agents. Also included in the chemical hazards
classification are toxic industrial chemicals. Chemical agents can be delivered
through a variety of means such as tactical ballistic missiles, bombs,
artillery, grenades, mines, and spray attacks. Due to their persistent nature,
nerve and blister pose the primary threat to air bases.</span></p>

<p><span>5.13.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Biological.&nbsp;</span></b><span>A biological agent is a microorganism (or a toxin derived from it)
that causes disease in personnel, plants, or animals or causes the
deterioration of materiel. Biological agents include viruses, bacteria, fungi,
and toxins cultured from living organisms. Biological agents may be found as
liquid droplets, aerosols, or dry powders and can be adapted for use as an
adversarial weapon. Biological agents can be delivered through a variety of
means such as spray attacks, aerosol releases, or covert attacks. Personnel may
not experience symptoms immediately after being exposed to biological agents.
Each agent has a different exposure (or incubation) period before infection.</span></p>

<p><span>5.13.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Radiological and Nuclear.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Radiation is a broad term that applies to a wide range of
phenomena. Light (infrared to ultraviolet), radiofrequency emissions and
microwaves are all forms of radiation known as nonionizing radiation. In
general, nonionizing radiation produces heat when it interacts with the body.
In contrast, ionizing radiation has sufficient energy to produce ions when it
interacts with matter (including the human body). Radiation causes harmful effects
to personnel because the ionization and excitation alters or destroys cell
processes and structures essential for the normal functioning of the cell.</span></p>

<p><span>5.13.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Radiological Delivery Means.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Adversaries may disseminate radioactive materials by utilizing
a radiological dispersal device. This device disseminates radioactive material
across an area without a nuclear detonation. A radiological dispersal device
could function as a terror weapon or terrain-denial mechanism. For example, a
radiological dispersal device could function by using conventional explosives
to blow-up and scatter radioactive source debris across a relatively small
area; this device is also known as a dirty bomb.</span></p>

<p><span>5.13.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Nuclear Delivery Means.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Nuclear weapons can be detonated at various altitudes to
include subsurface, surface, airburst, or high altitude. The primary concerns
of a nuclear detonation include blast/shock, thermal radiation (heat), ionizing
radiation, and ballistic debris for surface and shallow subsurface bursts.
Nuclear blasts may also pose an electromagnetic pulse hazard that can cause
widespread communications and/or electrical problems. Each type of burst has a
different level of hazard ratio in regards to ionizing radiation, thermal
radiation, and blast/shock. For example, a subsurface burst may produce a high
level of blast and shock, but very little (if any) ionizing radiation
penetrating outside the surface of the earth.</span></p>

<p><span>5.13.4.&nbsp;<b>Toxic
Industrial Material.&nbsp;</b>Toxic industrial material hazards consist of
toxic industrial chemicals, toxic industrial biologicals, and toxic industrial
radiological material. Toxic industrial materials may be manufactured, stored,
distributed, or transported in close proximity to airbases. These widely
available toxic industrial materials are potential tools for asymmetric attacks
against airbases. Most present a vapor (inhalation) hazard. Toxic industrial
materials may also reduce the oxygen concentration below that required to
support life. If there is a toxic industrial material incident, the most
important action is immediate evacuation outside the hazard's path (if
feasible). Airmen must note that the protective mask, ensemble, and military
standard collective protection filters are not designed to provide protection
from toxic industrial materials. If evacuation is impractical, implement
shelter-in-place procedures.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.14.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Enemy
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Attack.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Armed Forces of the
United States must be prepared to conduct prompt, sustained, and decisive combat
operations in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments. An
adversary's chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear capabilities can
have a profound impact on United States and multinational objectives, campaign
plans, and supporting actions, and therefore must be taken into account in
planning. Adversaries use chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear to
disrupt efficient airbase mission operations, incapacitate and kill personnel,
and contaminate equipment, rendering it unusable or dangerous to use. Deterring
an adversary's use of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons
depends to a significant degree on effective preparations by the defender to
deny the adversary any meaningful advantage from the employment of such
weapons.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.15.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Actions.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Operations in a
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environment are intended to
balance mission continuation with force survivability to maximize mission
effectiveness during and after a chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear event. In-place and deployed forces must be prepared to conduct combat
operations as required by Air Force, major command, or theater directives. When
a crisis or conflict arises, mobility operations and force deployment begin.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.16.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Installation
Command and Control.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Effective chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear command and control is essential to
mission accomplishment and base survivability</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Effective wartime operations
require coordinated and integrated actions at all levels. Installation command
and control, in conjunction with the emergency operations center and unit
control centers, implements operational plans and priorities, controls and
monitors mission-generation capabilities, and ensures installation
survivability.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.17.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Individual
Protection:</span></b></p>

<p><span>5.17.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Individual protection is comprised of singular use or a
combination of individual protective equipment, vaccinations and prophylaxis,
protective shelters, evacuation, relocation, exposure control, contamination
control, and warning and notification systems. Measures are taken in stages
equal to the urgency and nature of the threat. Command and theater-specific
instructions will direct the proper individual protective postures.</span></p>

<p><span>5.17.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Regardless of the type of agent, concentration, or method of
attack, the best immediate protective equipment against chemical agents is the
ground crew ensemble, a whole-body system which protects the wearer against
chemical-biological warfare agents, toxins, and radiological particulates.
Individual protection includes a protective mask with filters, overgarment,
protective gloves, and footwear covers or overboots, and includes M8 and M9
detector paper, reactive skin decontamination lotion and M295 decontamination
kits.</span></p>

<p><span>5.17.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Nerve Agent Antidote.</span></b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Medical representatives
issue nerve agent antidotes and pretreatment during increased readiness.
Additionally, medical representatives will issue pyridostigmine bromide tablets
(P-tabs) if they anticipate use of a specific type of nerve agent. Members will
take these tablets only if/when directed by the commander. The tablets, when
combined with the antidote, will limit the effect of certain types of nerve
agent poisoning.</span></p>

<p><span>5.17.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Wartime
Sheltering.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The installation commander is responsible for
establishing a shelter plan and should designate unit responsibility for
preparing and operating each shelter during a chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear event. Shelters are structures that protect personnel
from chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear effects over extended
periods. Walls, doors, and windows offer limited physical barriers to chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear hazards penetration. Heating,
ventilation, and cooling systems should be shut off to prevent chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear hazard spread. Personnel may be required
to shelter-in-place in the event the type or extent of the hazard is unknown
and/or evacuation at the time would be dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span>5.17.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Collective Protection Systems</span></b><span>. These systems provide protection from chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear agents using an overpressure system to keep threat
agents outside the facility, ultimately allowing the occupants to work or rest
inside the facility without wearing protective gear. Many of these facilities
will have integrated contamination control areas, meaning contaminated
personnel are able to enter the facility once decontaminated. Installations
with collective protection systems should develop local procedures and provide
base populace training, as required.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.18. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
Nuclear Incident Management Phases.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force units must
take actions to prepare for, respond to, and recover from or mitigate the
effects of a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack or event.
These actions will ensure we can conduct prompt, sustained, and decisive combat
operations in chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear environments.</span></p>

<p><span>5.18.1. In each phase,
consistent approaches or actions are designed to save lives and to restore and
sustain mission operations. Airbase attack preparation begins before a
potential attack. Attack response actions focus primarily on individual and
weapon systems survival, and recovery actions focusing on saving lives,
detecting and mitigating hazards, mission restoration, and sustainment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.19. Preparedness.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Countering chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threats requires extraordinary
preparedness. Conducting preparedness actions effectively and efficiently will
increase the protection of mission critical resources and force survivability.
These actions should be considered mission critical and given a high priority
when the threat of enemy attack using chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear agents is high. Your installation will establish several actions to
counter chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attacks during the
preparedness phase. These actions will be dependent on your installation s
threat probabilities and Airmen should understand the importance of knowing
these actions well before a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
attack. They include actions associated with alarm conditions, mission-oriented
protective postures, split mission oriented protective posture, and
contamination control. Actions begin upon receipt of the warning order or when
the in-place forces are directed to transition to wartime operations.
Installations will refer to their risk management plan and implement actions
according to major command and theater guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>5.19.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Alarm Conditions and Mission-Oriented Protective
Posture Levels.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Attack warning signals
are established and used to notify base populace of emergency conditions. The
warnings may be communicated as audible alarms, through base public address
and/or giant voice systems, display of alarm condition flags, or through other
communication channels. The Air Force uses a standardized alarm system (see
Figure 5.4) and mission-oriented protective posture levels to communicate the
appropriate defense posture for in-place forces to take to transition to
wartime chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear operations. Attack
warning signals are used to posture air base for attacks, warn of attacks in
progress, initiate post attack recovery actions, and return the airbase to a
normal wartime state of readiness. Attack warning signal variations may be used
in some geographical regions. If used, Airmen will be notified of the
variations before departure from home station or upon arrival into the region.
For example, Alarm Blue is used instead of Alarm Red in South Korea.
Mission-oriented protective postures are used in conjunction with alarm
conditions quickly increase or decrease protection against chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.</span></p>

<p><span>5.19.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mission-Oriented Protective Postures.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Mission Oriented
Protective Postures levels (Figure 5.5) are established to quickly communicate
required individual protective equipment and protection levels. The levels are
designed to allow a rapid increase or decrease personal protective equipment in
response to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack alarm conditions.
The installation commander determines the initial level, based on
mission-oriented protective posture analysis, and adjusts levels as chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear risks and mission priorities change.</span></p>

<p><span>5.19.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Split Mission-Oriented Protective Posture.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear attacks can affect an entire airbase, but it is also
possible that the attack may only affect specific areas. Split
mission-orientated protective posture is a tactic used to split or divide an
installation or operating location into two or more chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear zones. Prior to hostilities, planners identify
installation chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear zones based on
installation geography and mission. These zones enable the commander to tailor
mission-oriented protective posture levels and alarm conditions within each
zone to better reflect the current hazard and mission priorities. By using
split mission-oriented protective postures the commander can divide the
installation into contaminated or non-contaminated zones, instead of declaring
the entire installation contaminated. This allows the installation to stay
operational and effective. Unit control centers control movement between one
zone to another. Personnel must be aware what alarm condition and
mission-oriented protective posture level applies before entering a zone.</span></p>

<p><span>5.19.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Split Mission-Oriented Protective Posture.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear attacks can affect an entire airbase, but it is also
possible that the attack may only affect specific areas. Split
mission-orientated protective posture is a tactic used to split or divide an
installation or operating location into two or more chemical, biological,

installation contaminated. This allows the installation to stay operational and
effective. Unit control centers control movement between one zone to another.
Personnel must be aware what alarm condition and mission-oriented protective
posture level applies before entering a zone.</span></p>

<p><span>5.19.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Contamination Avoidance Measures.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear threat areas, contamination avoidance is the key to
preventing assets and personnel from becoming contaminated. Implementing
quality avoidance procedures will ensure mission critical assets are available
for use when needed and allow for the survival of the base populace to employ
those resources.</span></p>

<p><span>5.19.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Protect Critical Resources.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Prior to a chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear attack, every unit must determine which
equipment and assets can be stored, protected, or covered to protect against
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination. Protecting these
vital resources will minimize or completely remove the requirement to
decontaminate and make the resource available for mission use quickly after an
attack. To the maximum extent possible, aircraft, vehicles, aerospace ground
equipment, and munitions should be covered or moved inside. Bulk supplies
should be placed in shelters or under overhead cover. If equipment cannot be
placed under overhead cover, it must be covered or wrapped with at least one
layer of barrier material to prevent contamination. However, the use at least
two layers of barrier material to cover the top, so any contamination can be
easily removed, safely discarded, and replaced is best. Resource protection
provides you with survival and sustainment measures for operations after
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warfare events.</span></p>

<p><span>5.19.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Facility Protection.</span></b></p>

<p><span>To ensure the inside of
facilities do not become contaminated, occupants will close all windows, doors,
and turn off ventilation systems at the time of the suspected chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear attack.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.20. Response.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Response actions during
and after a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack are critical
to not only ensure the Air Force mission is continued but more importantly for
your survival. During attacks, the primary focus of the base populace should be
directed toward force survivability to ensure attack warning signals and
mission-oriented protective posture levels are disseminated to the lowest level
rapidly. However, Airmen who recognize an attack in progress should take
immediate action regardless if mass notification has been disseminated.</span></p>

<p><span>5.20.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Notification.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Typically, the command
post will disseminate the attack warning signals via giant voice and other mass
notification means. Alarm signals and mission-oriented protective posture level
changes come to the command post from the Crisis Action Team based on
recommendations from the Emergency Operations Center.</span></p>

<p><span>5.20.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Seek Cover.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airmen need to use their
best judgment regarding how far they can run during an attack to gain overhead
cover or protection versus taking cover in an open area. Each situation is
different, therefore it is important for Airmen to gain situational awareness
and familiarize themselves with the surrounding environment before an attack
takes place. When Alarm Red is declared, or attack begins without notification,
drop to the ground, don protective mask (if not donned already), crawl to
closest available protection, don remaining individual protective equipment,
and immediately check every member of your unit to make sure they are protected
and have donned the proper equipment. After taking cover remain there until
directed otherwise. If your location becomes too dangerous to maintain, move to
a safer area. Assist injured personnel if possible.</span></p>

<p><span>5.20.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Render Self-Aid and Buddy Care.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Self-aid and buddy care
can be performed immediately, without transition into Alarm Black. Airmen who
provide selfaid and buddy care under fire should do so with caution to ensure
they do not become injured. Each situation is different and handled using good
judgment and risk analysis.</span></p>

<p><span>5.20.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Report.</span></b></p>

<p><span>If you observe attacks
or enemy personnel movement, report it up your chain of command immediately.
Use the SALUTE reporting method (Table 5.1) as a quick and effective way to
communicate attack information. SALUTE reports are submitted by the observer
upon encountering enemy activity, to your unit control center or work center
through the most secure means.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.21. Recovery.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Reestablishing the
mission is a top priority. Minimizing the amount of personnel exposed to post
attack hazards is critical for mission continuation and force survivability.
Successful base recovery efforts require a coordinated and integrated approach.
The recovery concept involves a combined effort from personnel trained to
operate as a team, using specialized equipment to spearhead recovery efforts.
Immediate actions are necessary to treat casualties, assess damage, and control
contamination.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.1.&nbsp;<b>Reconnaissance.&nbsp;</b>This
base-wide effort is initiated by the installation commander. The installation
commander will direct when base specialized and unit reconnaissance teams begin
post-attack chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear surveys. Unit
control centers will be directed to release post attack reconnaissance teams to
collect information about the effects of the attack. Post attack reconnaissance
teams or resource owners are responsible for marking and reporting
contamination, including contaminated equipment, to ensure approaching
personnel are aware of the hazard associated with that resource. This will
allow those approaching to don the appropriate protective gear to ensure they are
protected before coming too close to the hazard. Additionally, the post attack
reconnaissance team or resource owner must report information to their unit
control center. The unit control center will forward unit survey information to
the Emergency Operations Center.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.1.1. If you are not
on a reconnaissance team, your immediate recovery actions include performing
immediate decontamination (if contaminated) and remain under cover unless
otherwise directed.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Post Attack Reporting.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Effective communication between post attack reconnaissance teams
and leadership is invaluable. The Emergency Operations Center is the primary
command and control function for collecting and consolidating post attack
information. The Emergency Operations Center director up channels information
and makes recommendations regarding alarm signals and mission-oriented
protective posture levels to the Crisis Action Team based on the information
collected by specialized and unit reconnaissance teams.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Split Mission-Oriented Protective Posture Operations.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Commanders may implement split mission-oriented
protective posture for each pre-established airbase chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear zone based on the current hazard and mission
priorities within that area. Normal operations continue within areas unaffected
by the incident or at lower risk from the threat. Certain conditions and
procedures must be followed when moving equipment or members between clean and
contaminated areas.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Zone Transition Points</span></b><span>. If movement or travel between zones is necessary, use zone
transition points. Zone transition points are clear access routes into and out
of zones. Zone transition points help to contain contamination while allowing
the movement of people, equipment, and needed supplies. Unit control centers
control movement of their personnel and equipment between zones.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Decontamination.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Units will assess and determine what methods of
decontamination, if any, can be reasonably put into action. If a chemical agent
gets on the skin or protective equipment, it must be removed immediately. The
reactive skin decontamination lotion and M295 individual decontamination kits
are the most effective methods of removing chemical agents. In the absence of
an individual decontamination kit, a 5-percent chlorine solution will remove
the chemical agent from equipment and a 0.5 percent chlorine solution will
remove agents from the skin. The eyes are very vulnerable when exposed to nerve
and blister agents. If one of these agents gets in the eyes, the eyes should be
irrigated with water.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Contamination Control Area.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Should personnel become contaminated with chemical,
biological, or radiological agents, they decontaminate by processing through
the contamination control area within 24 hours of contact. If the individual
has positive indication of contamination on their M9 paper, they should report
contamination to their unit control center. Contaminated personnel and
equipment should not enter any facility. Unit control centers will direct
personnel to go to the contamination control area at the appropriate time.</span></p>

<p><span>5.21.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Chemically Contaminated Object Rule.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The chemically contaminated object rule
for mission oriented protective posture reduction is often applied by
commanders for operations in and near areas with contaminated objects. The
chemically contaminated object rule is a risk management philosophy designed to
warn people of chemically contaminated objects. It does not direct long
duration maintenance in, or on chemically contaminated resources. Although
there is an increased degree of risk when working in these areas, the rule
provides guidance for protecting personnel by specifying the type of individual
protective equipment required.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.22. Terrorist Use of Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, and Nuclear Material.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force installations
must prepare for the full range of terrorist threats, including use of
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons.</span></p>

<p><span>5.22.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Terrorist threat or use of chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear material is among the emerging transnational threats. The overwhelming
capability of the United States Armed Forces greatly limit adversary options.
Increasingly, nations and terrorist groups are compelled to make use of
asymmetric measures to accomplish their goals.</span></p>

<p><span>5.22.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Traditionally, the perceived threat of terrorism was directed
toward installations in foreign countries. Today, the terrorist use of
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear material is clearly an emerging
worldwide threat. Air Force personnel, equipment, and facilities at home and
abroad are highly visible targets for terrorist attacks. Therefore, chemical,
biological, radiological, and nuclear threat planning and response are
high-priority. The installation commander is responsible for protecting
installation personnel, facilities, and resources.</span></p>

<p><span>5.22.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Protective measures include evacuation, relocation, exposure
control, contamination control, warning and notification, and
sheltering-in-place. Protective measures are taken in stages equal to the
urgency and nature of the threat; a warning for an increased terrorist attack
or threat forces will increase defense readiness, according to declared force
protection conditions measures. Commanders at overseas locations will ensure
units receive specific instruction and guidance on personnel and resource
protection. Personnel deploying to overseas areas will ensure they are briefed,
before and on arrival, on the enemy attack threat, protective actions, and use of
protective equipment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>5.23. Conclusion.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The United States Air Force is the most ready and capable air and
space force in the world today. The Air Force's ability to achieve its mission
hinges on readiness. Each installation is different, but across the Air Force,
one element is constant; as an Airman you have an inherent responsibility to
maintain readiness within your unit and ensure your role in the installation s
Emergency Management program is executed and ultimately successful. Air Force
members should use emergency management fundamentals in concert with security
and standards of conduct to ensure readiness.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>STANDARDS OF CONDUCT</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 6A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>6.1.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In 1757, Lieutenant
Colonel George Washington said "discipline is the soul of an Army"
and those words still hold true in today's Air Force. Air Force standards must
be uniformly known, consistently applied and non-selectively enforced.
Accountability is critically important to good order and discipline of the force.
To navigate the necessary course of action and ensure mission accomplishment, a
leader must be willing to use more than one approach. Failure to ensure
accountability will destroy the trust of the American public, the very people
living under the Constitution we swore to support and defend, and who look to
us, the members of their Nation's Air Force, to embrace and live by the
standards that are higher than those in the society we serve. This chapter
discusses the Law of Armed Conflict, Code of Conduct, and general standards of
conduct. Airmen must learn these standards well enough not only to be able to
follow them, but be able to articulate them clearly to subordinates and enforce
proper observation by other members. Used in concert with information presented
in Chapter 5 and Chapter 19, this chapter covers issues vital to mission
effectiveness, especially in light of the Air Force global mission.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 6B Law of Armed
Conflict</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>6.2.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Law
of Armed Conflict Defined.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Law of War, as
defined by the Department of Defense (DoD), is that part of international law
that regulates the resort to armed force; the conduct of hostilities and the
protection of war victims in both international and non-international armed
conflict; belligerent occupation; and the relationships between belligerent,
neutral, and non-belligerent States.&nbsp;The law of war is often called
the Law of Armed Conflict.&nbsp;While DoD uses the term Law of War, most
Air Force doctrine and publications continue to use the term  Law of Armed
Conflict .&nbsp;The Law of Armed Conflict arises from civilized nations 
humanitarian desire to lessen the effects of conflicts. Law of Armed Conflict
protects combatants, noncombatants and civilians from unnecessary suffering,
and provides certain fundamental protections for persons who fall into the
hands of the enemy, particularly prisoners of war, civilians, and military
wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. The law also tries to keep conflicts from
degenerating into savagery and brutality, thereby helping to restore peace.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.3.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Law
of Armed Conflict Policy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>DoDD&nbsp;2311.01E,&nbsp;<i>Department
of Defense Law of War Program</i>, requires each military department to design
a program that ensures Law of Armed Conflict observance, prevents violations,
ensures prompt reporting of alleged violations, appropriately trains all
forces, and completes a legal review of new weapons. Law of Armed Conflict
training is an obligation of the U.S. under provisions of the 1949 Geneva
Conventions other law of war treaties and customary international law. AFI
51-401,<i>Training and Reporting to Ensure Compliance with the Law of Armed
Conflict</i>, requires that all Air Force personnel receive instruction on the
principles and rules of the Law of Armed Conflict commensurate with each
member's duties and responsibilities. The training is of a general nature;
however, certain groups such as aircrews, medical personnel, and security
forces receive additional, specialized training to address the unique
situations they may encounter.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.4.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>International
and Domestic Law.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Law of Armed
Conflict is embodied in both customary international law and treaties.
Customary international law, reflected in practices nations have come to accept
as legally binding, establishes many of the oldest rules that govern the
conduct of military operations in armed conflict. Article VI of the U.S.
Constitution states that treaty obligations of the</span></p>

<p><span>U.S. are the  supreme
law of the land,  and the U.S. Supreme Court has held that U.S. international
legal obligations, to include custom, is part of U.S. law. This means that
treaties and international agreements with the U.S. enjoy equal status to laws
passed by Congress and signed by the President. Therefore,
all&nbsp;persons&nbsp;subject to U.S. law must observe the U.S. Law of Armed
Conflict obligations. Military personnel, civilians, and contractors authorized
to accompany the armed forces in combat must consider the Law of Armed Conflict
to plan and execute operations and must obey Law of Armed Conflict in combat.
Those who commit violations may be criminally liable and court-martialed under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.5.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Principles.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Five important Law of
Armed Conflict principles govern armed conflict: military necessity,
distinction, proportionality, humanity, and honor.</span></p>



<p><span>6.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Military Necessity:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.5.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Military necessity is the principle that justifies the use of all
measures needed to defeat the enemy as quickly and efficiently as possible that
are not prohibited by the law of war.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Attacks must be limited to military objectives. Certain classes of
persons are military objectives and may be made the object of attack. These
classes of persons include: combatants, or unprivileged belligerents; and
civilians taking a direct part in hostilities. Military objectives, insofar as
objects are concerned, include any objects which by its nature, location,
purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose
total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances
ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage. Examples include
tanks, military aircraft, bases, supplies, lines of communications, and
headquarters.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Military necessity does not authorize all military action and
destruction. Under no circumstances may military necessity authorize actions
specifically prohibited by the law of war, such as the murder of prisoners of
war, ill treatment of prisoners of war or internees, the taking of hostages, or
execution or reprisal against a person or object specifically protected from
reprisal.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Humanity:&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Although military
necessity justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly
and efficiently as possible, military necessity cannot justify actions not
necessary to achieve this purpose, such as cruelty or wanton
violence.&nbsp;Moreover, once a military purpose has been achieved,
inflicting more suffering is unnecessary and should be avoided. For example, if
an enemy combatant has been placed hors de combat (e.g., incapacitated by being
severely wounded or captured), no military purpose is served by continuing to
attack him or her. Thus, the principle of humanity forbids making enemy
combatants who have been placed hors de combat the object of attack. Humanity
animates certain law of war rules, including prohibitions on weapons that are
calculated to cause superfluous injury; and prohibitions on weapons that are
inherently indiscriminate. For example, the 1907 Hague Convention prohibits the
use of poison or poisoned weapons in combat. Also, indiscriminate chemical,
biological, and bacterial weapons are banned by treaties because they cause
unnecessary suffering. However, using rifles to shoot prisoners of war,
strafing civilians, firing on shipwrecked mariners or downed aircrews are
lawful weapons that may be used unlawfully.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Distinction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>6.5.3.1. This principle
imposes a requirement to distinguish (also termed "discriminate")
between the civilian population (or individual civilians not taking a direct
part in the hostilities) and combatant forces when engaged in military
operations. Military force may be directed only against military objects or
objectives, and not against civilian objects.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.3.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Civilian objects are protected from attack and include such
objects as places of worship, schools, hospitals, and dwellings.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.3.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Civilian objects can lose their protected status if they are used
to make an effective contribution to military action.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.3.2. A defender has
an obligation to separate civilians and civilian objects (either in the
defender's country or in an occupied area) from military targets. Employment of
voluntary or involuntary human shields to protect military objectives or
individual military units or personnel is a fundamental violation of the law of
war principle of distinction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.4.&nbsp;<b>Proportionality:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.5.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Proportionality may be defined as the principle that even where
one is justified in acting, one must not act in way that is unreasonable or
excessive.&nbsp;Proportionality generally weighs the justification for
acting against the expected harms to determine whether the latter are
disproportionate in comparison to the former. In war, incidental damage to the
civilian population and civilian objects is unfortunate and tragic, but
inevitable. Thus, applying the proportionality rule in conducting attacks does
not require that no incidental damage result from attacks. Rather, this rule
obliges persons to refrain from attacking where the expected harm incidental to
such attacks would be excessive in relation to the military advantage
anticipated to be gained.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Proportionality most often refers to the standard applicable to
persons conducting attacks. Proportionality considerations, however, may also
be understood to apply to the party subject to attack, which must take feasible
precautions to reduce the risk of incidental harm. Proportionality also plays a
role in assessing whether weapons are prohibited because they are calculated to
cause unnecessary suffering.</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.4.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Damages and casualties must be consistent with mission
accomplishment and allowable risk to the attacking force (for example, the
attacker need not expose its forces to extraordinary risks simply to avoid or
minimize civilian losses).</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.5.&nbsp;<b>Honor:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.5.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Honor requires a certain amount of fairness in offense and
defense. In requiring a certain amount of fairness in offense and defense,
honor reflects the principle that parties to a conflict must accept that certain
limits exist on their ability to conduct hostilities. Honor also forbids resort
to means, expedients, or conduct that would constitute a breach of trust with
the enemy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.5.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>For example, enemies must deal with one another in good faith in
their non-hostile relations. And even in the conduct of hostilities, good faith
prohibits: (1) killing or wounding enemy persons by resort to perfidy; (2)
misusing certain signs; (3) fighting in the enemy's uniform; (4) feigning
non-hostile relations in order to seek a military advantage; and (5) compelling
nationals of a hostile party to take part in the operations of war directed
against their own country. Honor, however, does not forbid parties from using
ruses and other lawful deceptions against which the enemy ought to take
measures to protect itself.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.6. The Protection of War Victims and Classes
of Persons.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Some of the most
important Law of Armed Conflict rules come from the Geneva Conventions of 1949.
The Geneva Conventions consist of four separate international treaties that aim
to protect all persons taking no active part in hostilities, including members
of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat
by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause. These treaties also seek to
protect civilians and private property.</span></p>

<p><span>6.6.1.<b>&nbsp;Categories of Personnel:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.6.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Geneva
Convention Distinctions.&nbsp;</b>The Geneva Conventions distinguish between
combatants, noncombatants, and civilians.</span></p>

<p><span>6.6.1.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Combatants.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Three
classes of persons qualify as  lawful  or  privileged  combatants: (1) members
of the armed forces of a State that is a party to a conflict, aside from
certain categories of medical and religious personnel; (2) under certain
conditions, members of militia or volunteer corps that are not part of the
armed forces of a State, but belong to a State; and (3) inhabitants of an area
who participate in a kind of popular uprising to defend against foreign
invaders, known as a&nbsp;<i>lev e&nbsp;en&nbsp;masse</i>. A combatant is
commanded by a person responsible for subordinates; wears fixed distinctive
emblems recognizable at a distance, such as uniforms; carries arms openly; and
conducts his or her combat operations according to Law of Armed Conflict.
Lawful or privileged combatants are entitled to Prisoner of war Status if
captured and cannot be prosecuted for their lawful conduct in an armed
conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>6.6.1.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Noncombatants.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Noncombatants
include certain military personnel who are members of the Armed Forces not
authorized to engage in combatant activities, such as permanent medical
personnel and chaplains. Noncombatants must be respected and protected and may
not be made the object of attack.</span></p>

<p><span>6.6.1.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Civilians.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Civilians
are also protected persons and may not be made the object of direct attack.
They may, however, suffer injury or death incident to a direct attack on a
military objective without such an attack violating Law of Armed Conflict, if
such attack is on a lawful target by lawful means. With limited exceptions, the
Law of Armed Conflict does not authorize civilians to take an active or direct
part in hostilities. Civilians who take a direct part in hostilities without
authority to do so are unprivileged belligerent and can be made the object of
attacked when participating in hostiles.</span></p>

<p><span>6.6.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Unprivileged
Belligerents: A</b></span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Distinction Not Made by the Geneva Conventions.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The term unprivileged belligerent is not
used in the Geneva Conventions. The term  unprivileged belligerent , as defined
in the DoD Manual on the Law of War, includes  lawful combatants who have
forfeited the privileges of combatant status by engaging in spying or sabotage,
and private persons who have forfeited one or more of the protections of
civilian status by engaging in hostilities.  An unprivileged belligerent is an
individual who is not authorized by a state that is party to a conflict to take
part in hostilities but does so anyway. For example, civilians who plant
improvised explosive devices are unprivileged belligerents.</span></p>

<p><span>6.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Undetermined Status.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Should
doubt exist as to whether a captured individual is a lawful combatant,
noncombatant, or an unprivileged belligerent, the individual will receive the
protections of the Geneva Prisoner of War Convention until status is determined.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.7. Military Objectives.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Law of Armed
Conflict governs the conduct of aerial warfare. The principle of military
necessity authorizes aerial attacks on combatants and other lawful military
objectives. Military objectives are limited to those objects or installations
that by their own nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective
contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction,
capture, or neutralization in the circumstances existing at the time offer a
definite military advantage.</span></p>

<p><span>6.7.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Protection of Civilians and Civilian Objects.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Law of Armed Conflict
protects civilian populations. Military attacks against cities, towns, or
villages not justified by military necessity are forbidden. Attacking civilians
for the sole purpose of terrorizing them is also prohibited. Although civilians
may not be made the object of a direct attack, Law of Armed Conflict recognizes
that a military objective need not be spared because its destruction may cause
collateral damage that results in the unintended death or injury to civilians
or damage to their property. Commanders and their planners must take into
consideration the extent of damage to civilian objects and casualties
anticipated as a result of an attack on a military objective and seek to avoid
or minimize civilian casualties and destruction. Anticipated damage to civilian
objects and civilian casualties must not be disproportionate to the military
advantage sought. Judge advocate, intelligence, and operations personnel play a
critical role in determining the propriety of a target and the choice of weapon
to be used under the particular circumstances known to the commander when
planning an attack.</span></p>

<p><span>6.7.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Protected Objects.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Law of Armed
Conflict provides specific protection to certain objects, including medical
units or establishments; transports of wounded and sick personnel; military and
civilian hospital ships; safety zones established under the Geneva Conventions;
religious, cultural, and charitable buildings; monuments; and prisoner of war
camps. However, if these protected objects are used for military purposes, they
lose their protected status. Protected objects near lawful military objectives
that suffer collateral damage when the nearby military objectives are lawfully
engaged does not violate Law of Armed Conflict.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.8. Aircraft and Combat:</span></b></p>

<p><span>6.8.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Enemy Military Aircraft and Aircrew.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Enemy military aircraft
may be attacked and destroyed wherever found, unless in neutral airspace or
territory. Airmen who parachute from a disabled aircraft and offer no
resistance may not be attacked. Airmen who resist in descent or are downed
behind their own lines and who continue to fight may be subject to attack. The
rules of engagement for a particular operation often include additional
guidance for attacking enemy aircraft consistent with Law of Armed Conflict
obligations.</span></p>

<p><span>6.8.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Enemy Civilian Aircraft.</span></b></p>

<p><span>An enemy's public and private nonmilitary aircraft are generally
not subject to attack unless used for a military purpose. Since World War II,
nations have increasingly recognized the necessity to avoid attacking civil
aircraft. Under exceptional conditions, however, civil aircraft in flight may
be lawfully attacked. If a civil aircraft initiates an attack, it may be
considered an immediate military threat and may be lawfully attacked. An
immediate military threat justifying an attack may also exist when reasonable
suspicion exists of a hostile intent, such as when a civil aircraft approaches
a military base at high speed, or enters enemy territory without permission and
disregards signals or warnings to land or proceed to a designated place.</span></p>

<p><span>6.8.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Military Medical Aircraft.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military medical
aircraft are used exclusively for the removal of the wounded and sick and for
the transport of medical personnel and equipment. Military medical aircraft are
entitled to protection from attack by enemy combatants while flying at heights,
times, and on routes specifically agreed upon between the parties to the
conflict. Under Law of Armed Conflict, a military medical aircraft could be
lawfully attacked and destroyed if Military Medical Aircraft:</span></p>

<p><span>6.8.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Initiates an attack.</span></p>

<p><span>6.8.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Does not bear a clearly marked Red Cross, Red Crescent, or other
recognized symbol and is not otherwise known to be engaged in medical
operations at the time.</span></p>

<p><span>6.8.3.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Does not fly at heights, at times, and on routes specifically
agreed to by the parties to the conflict and is not otherwise known to be
engaged in medical operations at the time.</span></p>

<p><span>6.8.3.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Flies over enemy territory or enemy-occupied territory (unless
otherwise agreed upon by the parties) and is not otherwise known to be engaged
in medical operations at the time.</span></p>

<p><span>6.8.3.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Approaches enemy's territory or a combat zone and disregards a
summons to land and is not otherwise known to be engaged in medical operations
at the time.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.9. Enforcing Law of Armed Conflict Rules:</span></b></p>

<p><span>6.9.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Prosecution.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military members who
violate Law of Armed Conflict are subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment. Criminal prosecutions may take place in a national or international
forum. U.S. Armed Forces could be prosecuted by&nbsp;courtsmartial&nbsp;under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice or through an international military
tribunal, such as those used in Nuremberg and Tokyo after World War II.  I was
only following orders,  generally is not<i>&nbsp;</i>accepted by national or
international tribunals as a war crime defense. Individual Airmen are
responsible for their actions and must comply with Law of Armed Conflict.
Commanders can also be held criminally responsible for the actions of their
subordinates through the doctrine of command responsibility. Commanders can be
held criminally liable for the conduct of their subordinates when they issued
illegal orders or when they either knew or should have known that their
subordinates were committing war crimes.</span></p>

<p><span>6.9.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Reprisal.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Reprisals are the
commission of otherwise illegal acts that, under the circumstances, may be
justified as a last resort to put an end to illegal acts committed first by the
adversary. For example, if any enemy employs illegal weapons against a state,
the victim may resort to the use of weapons that would otherwise be unlawful in
order to compel the enemy to cease using the weapon. Reprisals can be legally
justified if they meet certain requirements. Authority to approve reprisals is
held at the highest decision-making level. Only the President of the U.S., as
Commander in Chief, may authorize U.S. forces to take such an action.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.10.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Reporting
Violations.</span></b></p>

<p><span>AFPD 51-4 includes
guidance for personnel who suspect or have information which might reasonably
be viewed as a violation of the Law of Armed Conflict committed by or against
U.S. personnel, enemy personnel or any other individual shall promptly report
the violation to their immediate commander. An Air Force member who knows or
receives a report of an apparent Law of Armed Conflict violation must inform
his or her commander. This includes violations by the enemy, allies, U.S. Armed
Forces, or others. If the allegation involves or may involve a U.S. commander,
the report should be made to the next higher U.S. command authority. Particular
circumstances may require that the report be made to the nearest judge
advocate, inspector general</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;a special agent in the Office of Special
Investigations, or a security forces member.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.11.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Rules
of Engagement.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Rules of engagement
exist to ensure use of force in an operation occurs according to national
policy goals, mission requirements, and the rule of law. In general, rules of
engagement set parameters for when, where, how, why, and against whom
commanders and their Airmen may use force. Mission-specific rules of engagement
present a more detailed application of Law of Armed Conflict principles
tailored to the political and military nature of a mission which are contained
in execution orders, operations&nbsp;plans, and operations orders. All Airmen
have a duty and a legal obligation to understand, remember, and apply mission
rules of engagement. Failure to comply with rules of engagement may be
punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The U.S. standing rules
of engagement, approved by the President and Secretary of Defense and issued by
the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, provide implementation guidance on the
inherent right of self-defense and the application of force for mission
accomplishment. Commanders at every echelon have an obligation to ensure that
mission rules of engagement comply with the standing rules of engagement.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.11.1.&nbsp;<b>Self Defense.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The fundamental U.S. policy
on self-defense is repeatedly stated throughout the standing rules of
engagement:  These rules do not limit a commander's inherent authority and
obligation to use all necessary means available to take all appropriate actions
in self-defense of the commander's unit and other U.S. forces in the
vicinity. &nbsp;Selfdefense&nbsp;methods include national, collective, unit,
and individual. Several elements must be considered before undertaking the use
of force in self-defense.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.11.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>De-escalation.&nbsp;</span></b><span>When time and circumstances permit, the forces committing hostile
acts or hostile intent should be warned and given the opportunity to withdraw
or cease threatening actions.</span></p>

<p><span>6.11.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Necessity.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Rules of engagement necessity exists if a hostile act is committed
or hostile intent is demonstrated against U.S. forces or other designated
persons or property. A hostile act is defined as force used against the U.S.,
U.S. forces, designated persons and property, or intended to impede the mission
of U.S. forces. Hostile intent is the threat of imminent use of force against
the U.S., U.S. forces, designated persons and property, or intended to impede
the mission of U.S. forces. Rules of engagement necessity relates to the threat
perceived by an individual and is different from the Law of Armed Conflict
concept of military necessity.</span></p>

<p><span>6.11.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Proportionality.&nbsp;</span></b><span>In self-defense, U.S. forces may only use the amount of force
necessary to decisively counter a hostile act or a demonstration of hostile
intent and ensure the continued safety of U.S. forces or other designated
persons and property. Force used must be reasonable in intensity, duration, and
magnitude compared to the threat based on facts known to the commander at the
time. Rules of engagement proportionality refers to the reasonableness of the
response to a threat and is different to the law of armed conflict concept of
proportionality. 6.11.1.4.&nbsp;<b>Pursuit.&nbsp;</b>U.S. forces can pursue and
engage a hostile force that has committed a hostile act or demonstrated a
hostile intent, if those forces continue to commit hostile acts or demonstrate
hostile intent. (Applicable rules of engagement may restrict or place
limitations on U.S. forces ability to pursue or engage a hostile force across
an international border.)</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 6C Code of
Conduct</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>6.12.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Policy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Code of Conduct
outlines basic responsibilities and obligations of members of the U.S. Armed
Forces. All members are expected to measure up to the standards described in
the Code of Conduct. Although developed for prisoners of war, the spirit and
intent are applicable to service members subject to other hostile detention.
Such service members should consistently conduct themselves in a manner that
brings credit to them and their country.<b>&nbsp;</b>The six articles of the
Code of Conduct address situations and decision areas that any member could
encounter to some degree. The Code of Conduct includes basic information useful
to prisoners of war to help them survive honorably while resisting captors 
efforts to exploit them. Such survival and resistance require knowledge and
understanding of the articles.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.13.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Training.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>DoD personnel who plan,
schedule, commit, or control members of the Armed Forces must fully understand
the Code of Conduct and ensure personnel have the training and education necessary
to abide by it. How much knowledge members need depends on how likely they are
to be captured, their exposure to sensitive information, and how useful or
valuable a captor considers them. Training is conducted at three levels:</span></p>

<p><span>6.13.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Level A Entry Level Training.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Level A represents the
minimum level of understanding needed for all members of the Armed Forces. This
level is imparted to all personnel during entry training.</span></p>

<p><span>6.13.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Level B Training After Assumption of Duty
Eligibility<i>.</i></span></b></p>

<p><span>Level B is the minimum
level of understanding needed for service members whose military jobs,
specialties, or assignments entail moderate risk of capture, such as members of
ground combat units. Training is conducted for such service members as soon as
their assumption of duty makes them eligible.</span></p>

<p><span>6.13.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Level C Training Upon Assumption of Duties or
Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Level C is the minimum
level of understanding needed for military service members whose military jobs,
specialties, or assignments entail significant or high risk of capture and
whose position, rank, or seniority makes them vulnerable to
greater-than-average exploitation efforts by a captor. Examples include
aircrews and special mission forces such as Air Force pararescue teams.
Training for these members is conducted upon their assumption of the duties or
responsibilities that make them eligible.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.14. The Articles of the Code of Conduct.</span></b></p>

<p><span>President Dwight D.
Eisenhower first published the Code of Conduct for members of the Armed Forces
of the U.S. on 17 August 1955. In March 1988, President Ronald W. Reagan
amended the code with gender-neutral language.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.1.&nbsp;<b>ARTICLE I.</b></span></p>

<p><i><span>I am an American,
fighting in the forces which guard my country and our way of life. I am
prepared to give my life in their defense.</span></i></p>

<p><span>6.14.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Explanation<i>.</i></span></b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Article
I&nbsp;applies&nbsp;to all members at all times. A member of the Armed Forces
has a duty to support U.S. interests and oppose U.S. enemies regardless of the
circumstances, whether in active combat or captivity.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Training.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Familiarity with
the wording and basic meaning is necessary to understand that:</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.1.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Past experience of captured Americans reveals that honorable
survival in captivity requires a high degree of dedication and motivation.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.1.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Maintaining these qualities requires knowledge of and a strong
belief in the advantages of American democratic institutions and concepts.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.1.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Maintaining these qualities also requires a love of and faith in
the U.S. and a conviction that the U.S. cause is just.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.1.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Honorable survival in captivity depends on faith in and loyalty to
fellow prisoners of war.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Possessing the dedication and motivation
fostered by such beliefs and trust may help prisoners of war survive long,
stressful periods of captivity, and has helped many return to their country and
families with their honor and self-esteem intact.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.2.&nbsp;<b>ARTICLE II.</b></span></p>

<p><i><span>I will never surrender
of my own free will. If in command, I will never surrender the members of my
command while they still have the means to resist.</span></i></p>

<p><span>6.14.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Explanation.</b>&nbsp;Members
of the Armed Forces may never surrender voluntarily. Even when isolated and no
longer able to inflict casualties on the enemy or otherwise defend themselves,
their duty is to evade capture and rejoin the nearest friendly force. Only when
evasion is impossible and further fighting would lead to their death with no
significant loss to the enemy may the means to resist or evade be considered
exhausted.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Training.</b>&nbsp;Service
members who are cut off, shot down, or otherwise isolated in enemy-controlled
territory must make every effort to avoid capture. Actions available include
concealment until recovered by friendly rescue forces, evasive travel to a
friendly or neutral territory, and evasive travel to other prebriefed areas.
Members must understand that capture is not dishonorable if all reasonable
means of avoiding it have been exhausted, and the only alternative is death.
Service members must understand and have confidence in search and recovery
forces rescue procedures and techniques, and proper evasion destination
procedures.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.3.&nbsp;<b>ARTICLE III.</b></span></p>

<p><i><span>If I am captured, I will
continue to resist by all means available. I will make every effort to escape
and aid others to escape. I will accept neither parole nor special favors from
the enemy.</span></i></p>

<p><span>6.14.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Explanation:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.14.3.1.1. An Armed
Forces member's duty to continue to resist enemy exploitation by all means
available is not lessened by the misfortune of capture. Contrary to the 1949
Geneva Conventions, enemies U.S. forces have engaged since 1949 have treated
the prisoner of war compound as an extension of the battlefield. The prisoner
of war must be prepared for this.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.3.1.2. Enemies have
used a variety of tactics to exploit prisoners of war for propaganda purposes
or to obtain military information, in spite of Geneva Conventions prohibition.
Physical and mental harassment, general mistreatment, torture, medical neglect,
and political indoctrination have all been used, and the enemy has tried to
tempt prisoners of war to accept special favors or privileges in return for
statements or information, or for a pledge by the prisoner of war not to
attempt escape.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.3.1.3. A prisoner
of war must not seek special privileges or accept special favors at the expense
of fellow prisoners of war. Under the guidance and supervision of the senior
military person, the prisoner of war must be prepared to take advantage of
escape opportunities. In communal detention, the welfare of the prisoners of
war who remain behind must be considered. Additionally, prisoners of war should
not sign or enter into a parole agreement. Parole agreements are promises the
prisoners of war make to the captor to fulfill stated conditions, such as not
to bear arms, in exchange for special privileges, such as release or lessened
restraint.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Training.</b>&nbsp;Members
should understand that captivity involves continuous control by a captor who
may attempt to use the prisoner of war as a source of information for political
purposes or as a potential subject for political indoctrination. Members must
familiarize themselves with prisoner of war and captor rights and obligations
under the Geneva Conventions, understanding that some captors have accused
prisoners of war of being war criminals simply because they waged war against
them. Continued efforts to escape are critical because a successful escape
causes the enemy to divert forces that may otherwise be fighting, provides the
U.S. valuable information about the enemy and other prisoners of war, and
serves as a positive example to all members of the Armed Forces. </span></p>

<p><span>6.14.4.&nbsp;<b>ARTICLE
IV.</b></span></p>

<p><i><span>If I become a prisoner
of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners. I will give no information
or take part in any action which might be harmful to my comrades. If I am
senior, I will take command. If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those
appointed over me and will back them up in every way.</span></i></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>6.14.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Explanation<i>.</i></b>&nbsp;Officers
and NCOs continue to carry out their responsibilities and exercise authority in
captivity. Informing, or any other action detrimental to a fellow prisoner of
war, is despicable and expressly forbidden. Prisoners of war must avoid helping
the enemy identify fellow prisoners of war who may have valuable knowledge to
the enemy. Strong leadership is essential to discipline. Without discipline,
camp organization, resistance, and even survival may be impossible. Personal
hygiene, camp sanitation, and care of the sick and wounded are imperative.
Wherever located, prisoners of war must organize in a military manner under the
senior military prisoner of war, regardless of military service. If the senior
prisoner of war is incapacitated or otherwise unable to act, the next senior
prisoner of war assumes command.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Training.</b>&nbsp;Members
must be trained to understand and accept leadership from those in command and abide
by the decisions of the senior prisoner of war, regardless of military service.
Failing to do so may result in legal proceedings under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice. Additionally, a prisoner of war who voluntarily informs or
collaborates with the captor is a traitor to the U.S. and fellow prisoners of
war and, after repatriation, is subject to punishment under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice. Service members must be familiar with the principles of
hygiene, sanitation, health maintenance, first aid, physical conditioning, and
food utilization.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.5.&nbsp;<b>ARTICLE V.</b></span></p>

<p><i><span>When questioned, should
I become a prisoner of war, I am required to give name, rank, service number,
and date of birth. I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my
ability. I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and
its allies or harmful to their cause.</span></i></p>

<p><span>6.14.5.1.<b>&nbsp;Explanation:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.14.5.1.1. When
questioned, a prisoner of war is required by the Geneva Conventions, and
permitted by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to give name, rank, service
number, and date of birth. Under the Geneva Conventions, the enemy has no right
to try to force a prisoner of war to provide any additional information.
However, it is unrealistic to expect a prisoner of war to remain confined for
years reciting only name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Many
prisoner of war camp situations exist in which certain types of conversation
with the enemy are permitted. For example, a prisoner of war is allowed, but not
required by the Code of Conduct, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or the
Geneva Conventions, to fill out a Geneva Conventions capture card, to write
letters home, and to communicate with captors on matters of health and welfare.
The senior prisoner of war is required to represent prisoners of war in matters
of camp administration, health, welfare, and grievances.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.5.1.2. A prisoner
of war must resist, avoid, or evade, even when physically and mentally coerced,
all enemy efforts to secure statements or actions that may further the enemy s
cause. Examples of statements or actions prisoners of war should resist include
giving oral or written confessions, answering questionnaires, providing
personal history statements, and making propaganda recordings and broadcast
appeals to other prisoners of war to comply with improper captor demands.
Additionally, prisoners of war should resist appealing for U.S. surrender or
parole, engaging in self-criticism, or providing oral or written statements or
communication that are harmful to the U.S., its allies, the Armed Forces, or
other prisoners of war. Experience has shown that, although enemy interrogation
sessions may be harsh and cruel, a prisoner of war can usually resist if there
is a will to resist. The best way for a prisoner of war to keep faith with the
U.S., fellow prisoners of war, and him or herself is to provide the enemy with
as little information as possible.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.5.2.<b>&nbsp;Training<i>.</i></b>&nbsp;Service
members familiarize themselves with the various aspects of interrogation,
including phases, procedures, and methods and techniques, as well as the
interrogator's goals, strengths, and weaknesses. Members should avoid
disclosing information by such techniques as claiming inability to furnish
information because of previous orders, poor memory, ignorance, or lack of
comprehension. They should understand that, short of death, a prisoner of war
may prevent a skilled enemy interrogator, using all available psychological and
physical methods of coercion, from obtaining some degree of compliance by the
prisoner of war is unlikely. However, the prisoner of war must recover as
quickly as possible and resist successive efforts to the utmost.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.6.&nbsp;<b>ARTICLE VI.</b></span></p>

<p><i><span>I will never forget that
I am an American, fighting for freedom, responsible for my actions, and
dedicated to the principles which made my country free. I will trust in my God
and in the United States of America.</span></i></p>

<p><span>6.14.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Explanation<i>.</i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>A
member of the Armed Forces remains responsible for personal actions at all
times. When repatriated, prisoners of war can expect their actions to be
subject to review, both circumstances of capture and conduct during detention.
The purpose of such a review is to recognize meritorious performance and, if
necessary, investigate any allegations of misconduct. Such reviews are
conducted with due regard for the rights of the individual and consideration
for the conditions of captivity.</span></p>

<p><span>6.14.6.2.<b>&nbsp;Training<i>.</i></b>&nbsp;Members
must understand the relationship between the Uniform code of Military Justice
and the Code of Conduct and realize that failure to follow the guidance may
result in violations punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and
they may be held legally accountable for their actions. They should also
understand that the U.S. Government will use every available means to establish
contact with prisoners of war, to support them, and to obtain their release.
Furthermore, U.S. laws provide for the support and care of dependents of the
Armed Forces, including prisoners of war family members. Military members must
ensure their personal affairs and family matters are up to date at all times.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.15. Detention of U.S. Military Personnel in
Operations Other than War:</span></b></p>

<p><span>6.15.1.&nbsp;<b>Policy<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>U.S. military personnel
isolated from U.S. control are still required to do everything in their power
to follow DoD and Air Force policy and survive with
honor.&nbsp;DoDI&nbsp;1300.21,&nbsp;<i>Code of Conduct (CoC) Training and
Education,&nbsp;</i>Enclosure 3, provides guidance to military members who find
themselves isolated during operations other than war or in a situation not
addressed specifically in the Code of Conduct. All military departments
establish procedures to ensure U.S. military personnel are familiar with the
guidance in this publication.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.2.&nbsp;<b>Rationale.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Because of their wide range
of activities, U.S. military personnel are subject to detention by unfriendly
governments or captivity by terrorist groups. When a hostile government or
terrorist group detains or captures U.S. military personnel, the captor is
often attempting to exploit both the individual and the U.S. Government for its
own purposes. As history has shown, exploitation can take many forms, such as
hostage confessions to crimes never committed, international news media
exploitation, and substantial ransom demands, all of which can lead to
increased credibility and support for the detainer.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.3.<b>&nbsp;Responsibility:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.15.3.1.<i>&nbsp;</i>U.S.
military personnel detained by unfriendly governments or held hostage by a
terrorist group must do everything in their power to survive with honor.
Furthermore, whether U.S. military personnel are detained or held hostage, they
can be sure the U.S. Government will make every effort to obtain their release.
To best survive the situation, military personnel must maintain faith in their
country, in fellow detainees or captives and, most importantly, in themselves.
In any group captivity situation, military captives must organize, to the
fullest extent possible, under the senior military member present. If civilians
are part of the group, they should be encouraged to participate.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.3.2. U.S. military
personnel must make every reasonable effort to prevent captors from exploiting
them and the U.S. Government. If exploitation cannot be prevented, military
members must attempt to limit it. If detainees convince their captors of their
low propaganda value, the captors may seek a quick end to the situation. When a
detention or hostage situation ends, military members who can honestly say they
did their utmost to resist exploitation will have upheld DoD policy, the
founding principles of the U.S., and the highest traditions of military
service.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.4.&nbsp;<b>Military Bearing and Courtesy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>U.S. military personnel
shall maintain their military bearing, regardless of the type of detention or
captivity, or harshness of treatment. They should make every effort to remain
calm, courteous, and project personal dignity. That is particularly important
during the process of capture and the early stages of internment when the
captors may be uncertain of their control over the captives. Discourteous,
nonmilitary behavior seldom serves the long-term interest of a detainee or
hostage and often results in unnecessary punishment that serves no useful
purpose.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Such behavior often results in punishment that
serves no useful purpose. In some situations, such behavior may jeopardize
survival and severely complicate efforts to gain release of the detainee or
hostage.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.5.<b>&nbsp;Guidance for Detention by
Governments:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.15.5.1. Detainees in
the custody of a hostile government, regardless of the circumstances that
resulted in the detention, are subject to the laws of that government.
Detainees must maintain military bearing and avoid aggressive, combative, or
illegal behavior that may complicate their situation, legal status, or efforts
to negotiate a rapid release. As American citizens, detainees should ask
immediately and continually to see U.S. embassy personnel or a representative
of an allied or neutral government. U.S. military personnel who become lost or
isolated in a hostile foreign country during operations other than war will not
act as combatants during evasion attempts. During operations other than war,
there is no protection afforded under the Geneva Convention. The civil laws of
that country apply.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.5.2. A detainer s
goal may be maximum political exploitation. Therefore, detained U.S. military
personnel must be cautious in all they say and do. In addition to asking for a
U.S. representative, detainees should provide name, rank, service number, date
of birth, and the innocent circumstances leading to their detention. They
should limit further discussions to health and welfare matters, conditions of
their fellow detainees, and going home.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.5.3. Detainees
should avoid signing any document or making any statement, oral or otherwise.
If forced, they must provide as little information as possible and then
continue to resist. Detainees are not likely to earn their release by
cooperation. Rather, release may be gained by resisting, thereby reducing the
value of the detainee. U.S. military detainees should not refuse release,
unless doing so requires them to compromise their honor or cause damage to the
U.S. Government or its allies. Escape attempts must be made only after
carefully considering the risk of violence, chance of success, and detrimental
effects on detainees remaining behind. Jailbreak in most countries is a crime.
Escape attempts can provide the detainer further justification to hold the
individual.</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.6.<b>&nbsp;Terrorist Hostage:</b></span></p>

<p><span>6.15.6.1. Capture by
terrorists is generally the least predictable and structured form of
operations, other than war captivity. Capture can range from a spontaneous
kidnapping to a carefully planned hijacking. In either situation, hostages play
an important role in determining their own fate because terrorists rarely
expect to receive rewards for providing good treatment or releasing victims
unharmed. U.S. military members should assume their captors are genuine
terrorists when unclear if they are surrogates of a government.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>6.15.6.2. A terrorist
hostage situation is more volatile than a government detention, so members must
take steps to lessen the chance of a terrorist indiscriminately killing
hostages. In such a situation, DoD policy accepts and promotes efforts to
establish rapport between U.S. hostages and the terrorists in order to
establish themselves as people in the terrorist's mind, rather than a
stereotypical symbol of a country the terrorist may hate. DoD policy recommends
U.S. personnel talk to terrorists about&nbsp;nonsubstantive&nbsp;subjects such
as family, sports, and hobbies. They should stay away from topics that could
inflame terrorist sensibilities, such as their cause, politics, or religion.
Listening can be vitally important when survival is at stake. Members should
take an active role in the conversation, but should not argue, patronize, or
debate issues with the captors. They should try to reduce tension and make it
as hard as possible for terrorists to identify U.S. personnel as troublemakers,
which may mark them for murder.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 6D Everyday
Conduct</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>6.16. Overview.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The importance of the
Air Force mission and responsibility to the nation requires members adhere to
higher standards than nonmilitary members. Every person is accountable for his
or her own actions on duty and off. Supervisors must hold subordinates
accountable and take corrective action if they do not fulfill their
responsibilities. Members must remember and reflect the Air Force Core
Values Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do in
everything they do.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.17.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Policy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>DoDD&nbsp;5500.07,&nbsp;<i>Standards
of Conduct,</i>&nbsp;DoD 5500.07-R,&nbsp;<i>The Joint Ethics Regulation (JER),
and&nbsp;</i>AFI 1-1,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Standards</i>&nbsp;provide guidance to
Air Force personnel on standards of conduct. Military members who violate the
punitive provisions may be prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. Civilian violations may result in disciplinary action without regard
to the issue of criminal liability. Military members and civilian employees who
violate these standards, even if such violations do not constitute criminal
misconduct, are subject to administrative actions, such as reprimands. Contact
the base legal office for assistance.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.18. Ethical Values.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Ethics are standards of
conduct based on values. Values are core beliefs, such as duty, honor, and
integrity that motivate attitudes and actions. Not all values are ethical
values (integrity is; happiness is not). Ethical values relate to what is right
and wrong and thus take precedence over&nbsp;nonethical&nbsp;values when making
ethical decisions. DoD employees who make decisions as part of their official
duties should carefully consider ethical values. Primary ethical values
include:</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.1.&nbsp;<b>Honesty.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Being truthful,
straightforward, and candid are aspects of honesty:</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.1.1. Truthfulness
is required. Deceptions are usually easily uncovered. Lies erode credibility
and undermine public confidence. Untruths told for seemingly altruistic reasons
(to prevent hurt feelings, to promote good will, etc.) are nonetheless resented
by the recipients.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.1.2.
Straightforwardness adds frankness to truthfulness and is usually necessary to
promote public confidence and to ensure effective, efficient conduct of
operations. Truths presented in such a way as to lead recipients to confusion,
misinterpretation, or inaccurate conclusions are not productive. Such indirect
deceptions can promote ill will and erode openness, especially when there is an
expectation of frankness.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.1.3. Candor is the
forthright offering of unrequested information. This ethical value is necessary
according to the gravity of the situation and the nature of the relationships.
Candor is required when a reasonable person would feel betrayed if the
information was withheld. In some circumstances, silence is dishonest; yet in
other circumstances, disclosing information would be wrong and perhaps
unlawful.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.2.&nbsp;<b>Integrity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Being faithful to one s
convictions is part of integrity. Following principles, acting with honor,
maintaining independent judgment, and performing duties with impartiality help
to maintain integrity and avoid conflicts of interest and hypocrisy.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.3.&nbsp;<b>Loyalty.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Fidelity, faithfulness,
allegiance, and devotion are all synonyms for loyalty. Loyalty is the bond that
holds the Nation and the U.S. Government together and the balm against
dissension and conflict. This ethical value is not blind obedience or
unquestioning acceptance of the status quo. Loyalty requires careful balance
among various interests, values, and institutions in the interest of harmony
and cohesion.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.4.&nbsp;<b>Accountability<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>DoD employees are
required to accept responsibility for their decisions and the resulting
consequences. This includes avoiding even the appearance of impropriety.
Accountability promotes careful, well-thought-out decisions, and limits thoughtless
action.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.5.&nbsp;<b>Fairness<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>Open mindedness and
impartiality are important aspects of fairness. DoD employees must be committed
to justice in the performance of their official duties. Decisions must not be
arbitrary, capricious, or biased. Individuals must be treated equally and with
tolerance.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.6.&nbsp;<b>Caring<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>Compassion is an
essential element of good government. Courtesy and kindness, both to those we
serve and to those with whom we work, help to ensure individuals are not
treated solely as a means to an end. Caring for others is the counterbalance
against the temptation to pursue the mission at any cost.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.7.&nbsp;<b>Respect<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>To treat people with
dignity, to honor privacy, and to allow self-determination are critical in a
government of diverse people. Lack of respect leads to a breakdown of loyalty
and honesty within a government and brings chaos to the international
community.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.8.&nbsp;<b>Promise-Keeping<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>No government can
function for long if its commitments are not kept. DoD employees are obligated
to keep their promises in order to promote trust and cooperation. Because of
the importance of promise-keeping, DoD employees must only make commitments
within their authority.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.9.&nbsp;<b>Responsible Citizenship<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>Responsible citizenship
is the duty of every citizen, especially DoD employees, to exercise discretion.
Public servants are expected to engage (employ) personal judgment in the
performance of official duties within the limits of their authority so that the
will of the people is respected according to democratic principles. Justice
must be pursued and injustice must be challenged through accepted means.</span></p>

<p><span>6.18.10.&nbsp;<b>Pursuit of Excellence<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>In public service,
competence is only the starting point. DoD employees are expected to set an
example of superior diligence and commitment. They are expected to strive
beyond mediocrity.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.19.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Professional and Unprofessional Relationships.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Professional
relationships are essential to the effective operation of all organizations,
military and civilian, but the nature of the military mission requires absolute
confidence in command and an unhesitating adherence to orders that may result
in inconvenience, hardships, injury, or death. While personal relationships
between Air Force members are normally matters of individual choice and
judgment, they become matters of official concern when they adversely affect or
have the reasonable potential to adversely affect the Air Force by eroding
morale, good order, discipline, respect for authority, unit cohesion, or
mission accomplishment. AFI 36-2909,&nbsp;<i>Professional and Unprofessional
Relationships,</i>&nbsp;establishes responsibilities for maintaining
professional relationships.</span></p>

<p><span>6.19.1.&nbsp;<b>Professional Relationships.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Professional
relationships contribute to the effective operation of the Air Force. The Air
Force encourages personnel to communicate freely with their superiors regarding
their careers and performance, duties, and missions. This type of communication
enhances morale and discipline and improves the operational environment while
at the same time preserving proper respect for authority and focus on the
mission. Participation by members of all grades in organizational activities,
such as base intramural,&nbsp;interservice, and&nbsp;intraservice&nbsp;athletic
competitions, unit-sponsored events, religious activities, community welfare
projects, and youth programs, enhances morale and contributes to unit cohesion.</span></p>

<p><span>6.19.2.<b>&nbsp;Unprofessional
Relationships.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Unprofessional
relationships, whether pursued on or off-duty, are those relationships that
detract from the authority of superiors or result in, or reasonably create the
appearance of, favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of
organizational goals for personal interests. Unprofessional relationships can
exist between officers, between enlisted members, between officers and enlisted
members, and between military personnel and civilian employees or contractor
personnel. Familiar relationships in which&nbsp;one member&nbsp;exercises
supervisory or command authority and relationships that involve shared living
accommodations, vacations, transportation, or off-duty interests on a frequent
or recurring basis in the absence of any official purpose or organizational
benefit present a high risk of becoming unprofessional.</span></p>

<p><span>6.19.3.<b>&nbsp;Fraternization.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Fraternization is an
aggravated form of unprofessional relationship.&nbsp;As defined by the manual
for courts-martial<i>,</i>&nbsp;fraternization is a personal relationship
between an officer and an enlisted member that violates the customary bounds of
acceptable behavior in the Air Force and prejudices good order and discipline,
discredits the Armed Services, or operates to the personal disgrace or dishonor
of the officer involved. The custom recognizes that officers will not form personal
relationships with enlisted members on terms of military equality, whether on
or off duty. Although the custom originated in an all-male military,
fraternization is gender neutral. Fraternization can occur between males,
between females, and between males and females. Because of the potential damage
fraternization can do to morale, good order, discipline, and unit cohesion,
fraternization is specifically prohibited in the manual for courts-martial and
punishable under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.20. General Guidelines on Avoiding
Unprofessional Relationships Including Fraternization.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military experience has
shown that certain kinds of personal relationships present a high risk for
being (or developing into) unprofessional relationships. Unprofessional
relationships negatively impact morale and discipline. While some personal
relationships are not initially unprofessional, they may become unprofessional
when circumstances change. For example, factors that can change an otherwise
permissible relationship into an unprofessional relationship include the
members' relative positions in the organization and the members' relative
positions in the supervisory and command chains. Air Force members, both
officer and enlisted, must be sensitive to forming these relationships and
consider the probable impact of their actions on the Air Force in making their
decisions. The rules regarding these relationships must be somewhat elastic to
accommodate differing conditions. However, the underlying standard is that Air
Force members are expected to avoid relationships that negatively affect morale
and discipline. When economic constraints or operational requirements place
officers and enlisted members of different grades in close proximity with one another
(such as combined or joint clubs, joint recreational facilities, or mixed
officer and enlisted housing areas), military members are expected to maintain
professional relationships. Although maintaining professional relationships is
more difficult under certain circumstances, it does not excuse a member s
responsibility to maintain standards.</span></p>

<p><span>6.20.1.&nbsp;<b>Relationships within an
Organization.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Unduly familiar
relationships between members in which&nbsp;one member&nbsp;exercises
supervisory or command authority over the other can easily be or become
unprofessional. Similarly, as differences in grades increase, even in the
absence of a command or supervisory relationship, there may be more risk that
the relationship will become, or is perceived to be, unprofessional because
senior members in military organizations normally exercise authority or have
some direct or indirect organizational influence over more junior members. The
danger for abuse of authority is always present. A senior member's ability to
directly or indirectly influence assignments, promotion recommendations,
duties, awards, or other privileges and benefits places both the senior and
junior members in a vulnerable position. Once established, such relationships
do not go unnoticed by other members of the unit. Service members must also
avoid unprofessional relationships (including fraternization) between members
of different services, particularly in joint service operations, because such
relationships may have the same impact on morale and discipline as they would
for members assigned to the same service.</span></p>

<p><span>6.20.2.&nbsp;<b>Relationships with Civilian
Employees.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Civilian employees and
contractor personnel are an integral part of the Air Force. They contribute
directly to readiness and mission accomplishment. Consequently, military
members of all grades must maintain professional relationships with civilian
employees, particularly those whom they supervise or direct. They must avoid
relationships that adversely affect or reasonably might adversely affect
morale, discipline, and respect for authority, or that violate law or
regulation.</span></p>

<p><span>6.20.3.&nbsp;<b>Dating and Close Friendships<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>Dating, intimate
relationships, and close friendships between men and women are subject to the
same policy considerations as are other relationships. Like any personal
relationship, they become a matter of official concern when they adversely
affect morale, discipline, unit cohesion, respect for authority, or mission
accomplishment. Members must recognize that these relationships can adversely
affect morale and discipline, even when the members are not in the same chain
of command or unit. The formation of such relationships between superiors and
subordinates within the same chain of command or supervision is prohibited
because such relationships invariably raise the perception of favoritism or
misuse of position and erode morale, discipline and unit cohesion.</span></p>

<p><span>6.20.4.&nbsp;<b>Shared Activities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Sharing living
accommodations, vacations, transportation, and off-duty interests on a frequent
or recurring basis can be perceived as unprofessional. Often the frequency of
these activities or the absence of an official purpose or organizational
benefit is what causes them to become, or to be perceived as, unprofessional.
While an occasional round of golf, game of racquetball, or similar activity
between a supervisor and subordinate could remain professional, daily or weekly
occurrences could result in at least the perception of an unprofessional
relationship. Similarly, while it may be appropriate for a first sergeant to play
golf with a different group of officers from his or her organization each
weekend in order to get to know them better, playing with the same officers
every weekend may be, or be perceived as, unprofessional.</span></p>

<p><span>6.20.5.&nbsp;<b>Training, Schools, and
Professional Military Education.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Personal relationships
between recruiters and potential recruits during the recruiting process or
between students and faculty or staff in training schools or professional
military education settings are generally prohibited. These interpersonal
relationships are especially susceptible to abuse of position, partiality or
favoritism, or can easily create the appearance of such. This is particularly
true during the recruiting process and in basic military training, because the
potential recruit or junior military member is often unfamiliar with Air Force
standards and dependent on the senior member, and the senior member is in a
position to directly affect, positively or negatively, the career of the junior
member.</span></p>

<p><span>6.20.6.&nbsp;<b>Other Relationships.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Other relationships not
specifically addressed, depending on the circumstances, can lead to actual or
perceived favoritism or preferential treatment, and must be avoided. Examples
of activities that may adversely impact morale, discipline, and respect for
authority include gambling, partying with subordinates, soliciting or making
solicited sales to subordinates, joint business ventures, or soliciting (or
making solicited sales) to members junior in rank, grade, or position.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.21. Consequences of Unprofessional Conduct.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military members are
subject to lawful orders. When a military member has been lawfully ordered to
cease an unprofessional relationship or refrain from certain conduct, the
military member is subject to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice for violating the order. Similarly, all military members are subject to
prosecution for criminal offenses committed incidental to an unprofessional
relationship (such as gambling, adultery, or assault).</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.22. Responsibilities for Professional
Relationships:</span></b></p>

<p><span>6.22.1.&nbsp;<b>Individuals.</b></span></p>

<p><span>All military members
share the responsibility for maintaining professional relationships. However,
the senior member (officer or enlisted) in a personal relationship bears
primary responsibility for maintaining professional relationships. Leadership
requires personnel to exercise maturity and judgment and avoid relationships
that undermine respect for authority or have a negative impact on morale,
discipline, or the mission of the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>This is especially true
of officers and noncommissioned officers who are expected to exhibit the
highest standards of professional conduct and to lead by example. The senior
member in a relationship is in the best position to appreciate the effect the
relationship could have on an organization and is in the best position to
terminate or limit the extent of the relationship. However, all members should
expect to be, and must be, held accountable for how their conduct impacts the
Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>6.22.2.&nbsp;<b>Commanders and Supervisors.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Commanders and
supervisors at all levels have the authority and responsibility to maintain
good order, discipline, and morale within their units. They may be held
accountable for failing to act in appropriate cases.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.23. Actions in Response to Unprofessional
Relationships.</span></b></p>

<p><span>If a relationship is
prohibited by AFI 36-2909 or is causing (or if good professional judgment and
common sense indicate that a relationship may reasonably result in) a
degradation of morale, good order, discipline or unit cohesion, a commander or
supervisor should take corrective action.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Actions should normally
be the least severe necessary to terminate the unprofessional aspects of a
relationship, but a full spectrum of administrative actions is available and
should be considered. Administrative actions include, but are not limited to;
counseling, reprimand, creation of an unfavorable information file, removal
from position, reassignment, demotion, delay of or removal from a promotion
list, adverse or referral comments in performance reports, and administrative
separation. One or more complementary actions can be taken. Experience has
shown that counseling is often an effective first step in curtailing
unprofessional relationships. More serious cases may warrant administrative
action or nonjudicial punishment</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>An order to terminate a relationship, or the
offensive portion of a relationship, can and should be given whenever it is
apparent that lesser administrative action may not be effective. Officers or
enlisted members who violate such orders are subject to action under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice for violation of the order.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Instances of actual favoritism, partiality, or misuse of grade or
position may constitute independent violations of the Uniform Code of Military
Justice or the punitive provisions of the Joint Ethics Regulation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.24. Financial Responsibility.</span></b></p>

<p><span>AFI 36-2906,&nbsp;<i>Personal
Financial Responsibility</i>, establishes administrative and management
guidelines for alleged delinquent financial obligations and for processing financial
claims against Air Force members. The AFI also outlines basic rules for
garnishment.</span></p>

<p><span>6.24.1.<b>&nbsp;Responsibilities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Military members will:</span></p>

<p><span>6.24.1.1. Pay their just
financial obligations in a proper and timely manner.</span></p>

<p><span>6.24.1.2. Provide
adequate financial support of a spouse, child or any other relative for which
the member receives additional support allowances. Members will also comply
with the financial support provisions of a court order or written support
agreement.</span></p>

<p><span>6.24.1.3. Respond to
applications for involuntary allotments of pay within the suspense dates
established by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service or the commander.</span></p>

<p><span>6.24.2.&nbsp;<b>Handling
Complaints.&nbsp;</b>Complainants are often unfamiliar with Air Force
organizational addresses or do not know the member's actual unit of assignment,
and so frequently address correspondence to the installation commander, staff
judge advocate, or force support squadron. The complaint is forwarded for
action to the individual's commander, who attempts to respond within 15 days.
If the member has had a permanent change of station, the complaint is forwarded
to the new commander, and the complainant is notified of the referral. If the
member has separated with no further military service or has retired, the
complainant is notified and informed that the member is no longer under Air
Force jurisdiction and the Air Force is unable to assist. (<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;Retired
members' retirement pay can be garnished for child support or alimony
obligations.) Commanders must actively monitor complaints until they are
resolved. Failure to pay debts or support dependents can lead to administrative
or disciplinary action. If the commander decides the complaint reflects
adversely on the member, this action should be included in the unfavorable information
file.</span></p>

<p><span>6.24.3.&nbsp;<b>Personal Financial Management
Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The personal financial
management program is an Airman and Family Readiness Center program that offers
information, education, and personal financial counseling to help individuals
and families maintain financial stability and reach their financial goals.
Personal financial management program provides education to all personnel upon
arrival at their first duty station. Personal financial management program
education includes, at minimum, facts about personal financial management
program, checkbook maintenance, budgeting, credit buying, state or country
liability laws, and local fraudulent business practices. The personal financial
management program also provides refresher education for all senior airmen and
below upon arrival at a new installation. Personal financial management program
services are free.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 6E Ethics and
Conflict of Interest Prohibitions</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>6.25. Overview.</span></b></p>

<p><span>DoD policy requires a
single, uniform source of standards on ethical conduct and ethics guidance be
maintained within DoD. Each DoD agency will implement and administer a
comprehensive ethics program to ensure compliance.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.26. Bribery and Graft.</span></b></p>

<p><span>DoD employees and
military members are directly or indirectly prohibited from giving, offering,
promising, demanding, seeking, receiving, accepting, or agreeing to receive
anything of value to influence any official act. They are prohibited from
influencing the commission of fraud on the U.S., inducing commitment or
omission of any act in violation of a lawful duty, or from influencing
testimony given. They are prohibited from accepting anything of value for, or
because of, any official act performed or to be performed. These prohibitions
do not apply to the payment of witness fees authorized by law or certain travel
and subsistence expenses.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.27. Compensation from Other Sources.</span></b></p>

<p><span>DoD employees and
military members are prohibited from receiving pay or allowance or supplements
of pay or benefits from any source other than the U.S. for the performance of
official service or duties unless specifically authorized by law. A task or job
performed outside normal work hours does not necessarily allow employees to
accept payment for performing it. If the undertaking is part of one's official
duties, pay for its performance may not be accepted from any source other than
the U.S. regardless of when it was performed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.28. Additional Pay or Allowance.</span></b></p>

<p><span>DoD employees and
military members may not receive additional pay or allowance for disbursement
of public money or for the performance of any other service or duty unless
specifically authorized by law. Subject to certain limitations, civilian DoD
employees may hold two distinctly different federal government positions and
receive salaries for both if the duties of each are performed. Absent specific
authority, however, military members may not do so because any arrangement by a
military member for rendering services to the federal government in another
position is incompatible with the military member's actual or potential
military duties. The fact that a military member may have leisure hours during
which no official duty is performed does not alter the result.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.29. Commercial Dealings Involving DoD
Personnel.</span></b></p>

<p><span>On or off duty, a DoD
employee or military member shall not knowingly solicit or make solicited sales
to DoD personnel who are junior in rank, grade, or position, or to the family
members of such personnel. In the absence of coercion or intimidation, this
does not prohibit the sale or lease of a DoD employee's or military member s
noncommercial personal or real property or commercial sales solicited and made
in a retail establishment during off-duty employment. This prohibition includes
the solicited sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics,
household supplies, vitamins, and other goods or services. Solicited sales by
the spouse or other household member of a senior-ranking person to a junior
person are not specifically prohibited but may give the appearance that the DoD
employee or military member is using public office for personal gain. If in
doubt, consult an ethics counselor. Several related prohibitions in this area
include:</span></p>

<p><span>6.29.1. Engaging in
off-duty employment or outside activities that detract from readiness or pose a
security risk, as determined by the employee's or member's commander or
supervisor.</span></p>

<p><span>6.29.2. Engaging in
outside employment or activities that conflict with official duties.</span></p>

<p><span>6.29.3. Receiving
honoraria for performing official duties or for speaking, teaching, or writing
that relates to one's official duties.</span></p>

<p><span>6.29.4. Misusing an
official position, such as improper endorsements or improper use of nonpublic
information.</span></p>

<p><span>6.29.5. Certain post-government
service employment. See DoD 5500.07-R, Chapter 9, for specific guidance.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.30. Gifts from Foreign Governments.</span></b></p>

<p><span>AFI 51-901,&nbsp;<i>Gifts
from Foreign Governments,</i>&nbsp;requires all Air Force military and civilian
personnel, and their dependents, to report gifts from foreign governments if
the gift, or combination of gifts, at one presentation exceeds a U.S. retail
value of $375. Gifts in excess of this minimal value may be accepted on behalf
of the Air Force and a request for disposition instructions should be forwarded
to SAF/AA within 60 days of receiving the gift. This requirement includes gifts
that recipients want to keep for official use or display. The U.S. Attorney
General may bring a civil action in any court of the U.S. against any person
who knowingly solicits or accepts a gift from a foreign government that is not
approved by Congress, or who fails to deposit or report such a gift, as
required by AFI 51-901. Failure to report gifts valued in excess of $375 could
result in a penalty not to exceed the retail value of the gift plus
$5,000.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;The limit on gifts from foreign governments is
set by Congress and changes periodically. Be sure to confirm the most current
limit with your ethics counselor when considering foreign gift issues.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.31. Contributions or Presents to Superiors:</span></b></p>

<p><span>6.31.1. On an occasional
basis, including any occasion when gifts are traditionally given or exchanged,
the following may be given to an official supervisor by&nbsp;a subordinate or
other employees&nbsp;receiving less pay:</span></p>

<p><span>6.31.1.1. Items, other
than cash, with an aggregate market value of $10 or less.</span></p>

<p><span>6.31.1.2. Items such as
food and refreshments to be shared in the office among several employees.</span></p>

<p><span>6.31.1.3. Personal
hospitality provided at a residence and items given in connection with personal
hospitality, which is of a type and value customarily provided by the employee
to personal friends.</span></p>

<p><span>6.31.2. A gift
appropriate to the occasion may be given to recognize special, infrequent
occasions of personal significance, such as marriage, illness, or the birth or
adoption of a child. Contributions or presents are also permissible upon
occasions that terminate a subordinate-official supervisor relationship, such
as retirement, separation, or reassignment. Regardless of the number of employees
contributing, the market value of the gift cannot exceed $300. Even though
contributions are voluntary, the maximum contribution one DoD employee may
solicit from another cannot exceed $10.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.32. Federal Government Resources.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Federal government resources,
including personnel, equipment, and property, will be used by DoD employees and
military members for official purposes only. Agencies may, however, permit
employees or military members to make limited personal use of resources other
than personnel, such as a computer, calculators, libraries, etc., if the use:</span></p>

<p><span>6.32.1. Does not
adversely affect the performance of official duties by the employee, military
member, or other DoD personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>6.32.2. Is of reasonable
duration and frequency and is made during the employee's or military member s
personal time, such as after duty hours or during lunch periods.</span></p>

<p><span>6.32.3. Serves a
legitimate public interest, such as supporting local charities or volunteer
services to the community.</span></p>

<p><span>6.32.4. Does not reflect
adversely on the DoD.</span></p>

<p><span>6.32.5. Creates no
significant additional cost to the DoD or government agency.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.33. Communication Systems.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Federal Government
communication systems and equipment including telephones, fax machines,
electronic mail, and Internet systems will be used for official use and
authorized purposes only. Official use includes emergency communications and,
when approved by commanders in the interest of morale and welfare, may include
communications by DoD personnel deployed for extended periods on official DoD
business. Authorized purposes include brief communication while traveling on
government business to notify family members of official transportation or
schedule changes. Also authorized are personal communications from the DoD
employee's or military member's usual workplace that are most reasonably made
while at the workplace, such as checking in with spouse or minor children;
scheduling doctor, auto, or home repair appointments; brief Internet searches;
and emailing directions to visiting relatives, when the agency designee
permits. However, many restrictions do apply. Consult DoD 5500.07-R<i>&nbsp;</i>for
additional guidance; then consult the organizational point of contact.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.34. Gambling, Betting, and Lotteries.</span></b></p>

<p><span>While on federally owned
or leased property or while on duty, a DoD employee or military member will not
participate in any gambling activity except:</span></p>

<p><span>6.34.1. Activities by
organizations composed primarily of DoD personnel or their dependents for the
benefit of welfare funds for their own members or for the benefit of other DoD
personnel or their dependents, subject to local law and DoD 5500.07-R.</span></p>

<p><span>6.34.2. Private wagers
among DoD personnel if based on a personal relationship and transacted entirely
within assigned government living quarters and subject to local laws.</span></p>

<p><span>6.34.3. Lotteries
authorized by any state from licensed vendors.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 6F Political
Activities</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>6.35. Overview.</span></b></p>

<p><span>It is Air Force policy
to encourage Regular Air Force members to carry out their rights and
responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. While on Regular Air Force members are
prohibited from engaging in certain political activities in order to maintain
good order and discipline and to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance
of improper endorsement in political matters. For more guidance,
see&nbsp;DoDD&nbsp;1344.10,&nbsp;<i>Political Activities by Members of the
Armed Forces</i>, and AFI 51-902,&nbsp;<i>Political Activities by Members of
the U.S. Air Force</i>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.36. Rights.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In general, a member on
Regular Air Force may register to vote, vote, and express his or her personal
opinion on political candidates and issues, but not as a representative of the
Armed Forces. Members may make monetary contributions to a political party,
organization or committee that favors a political candidate or slate of
candidates. They may attend partisan and nonpartisan political meetings or
rallies as spectators when not in uniform.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.37. Prohibitions.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A member on Regular Air
Force will not use his or her official authority or influence to interfere with
an election, affect the course or outcome of an election, solicit votes for a
particular candidate or issue, or require or solicit political contributions
from others. A member cannot participate in partisan political management,
campaigns, or conventions. Members who engage in any of the prohibited
activities listed in paragraph 4.1 of AFI 51-902, are subject to prosecution
under Article 92, UCMJ, in addition to any other applicable provision of the
UCMJ or Federal law. A member may not be a candidate for, or hold, civil office
except as outlined in paragraph 6.37.1.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.1.&nbsp;<b>Candidacy for Elected Office.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A member may not
campaign as a nominee or as a candidate for nomination. However, enlisted
members may seek and hold nonpartisan civil office, such as a notary public or
school board member, neighborhood planning commission, or similar local agency,
as long as such office is held in a private capacity and does not interfere
with the performance of military duties. There are also specific exceptions to
the prohibition on holding elected office that permit reservists in certain
elected or appointed civil offices in federal, state, and local government to
remain in office when called to Regular Air Force for no more than 270 days.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.<b>&nbsp;Additional Specific
Prohibitions.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A member may not:</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.1. Allow, or
cause to be published, partisan political articles signed or authorized by the
member for soliciting votes for or against a partisan political party or
candidate.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.2. Serve in any official
capacity or be listed as a sponsor of a partisan political club.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.3. Speak before a
partisan political gathering of any kind for promoting a partisan political
party or candidate.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.4. Conduct a
political opinion survey under the auspices of a partisan political group or
distribute partisan political literature.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.5. Perform
clerical or other duties for a partisan political committee during a campaign
or on Election Day.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.6. March or ride
in a partisan political parade.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.7. Use
contemptuous words against the officeholders described in Title 10, U.S. Code,
Section 888,&nbsp;<i>Contempt Toward Officials</i>&nbsp;(officers only).</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.8. Display a
large political sign, banner, or poster (as distinguished from a bumper
sticker) on a private vehicle.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.9. Display a
political sign, banner or poster on the outside of a residence in government
(including privatized) housing.</span></p>

<p><span>6.37.2.10. For
additional prohibitions refer to AFI 51-902, paragraph 4.1.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.38. Voting.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The DoD Federal Voting
Assistance Program is responsible for administering the Uniformed and Overseas
Citizens Absentee Voting Act. Specifically, the DoD Federal Voting Assistance
Program mission is to inform and educate U.S. citizens worldwide of their right
to vote; foster voting participation; and protect the integrity of and enhance
the electoral process at the Federal, state, and local levels. The Uniformed
and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires that states and territories
allow certain groups of citizens, including military members on Regular Air
Force and their families, to register and vote absentee in elections for
federal offices. In many states, laws exist that allow military members and
their families to vote absentee in state and local elections. The Uniformed and
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires each federal department and
agency with personnel covered by the act to have a voting assistance program.
Critical to the success of this program are the voting assistance officers.
These individuals, military and civilian, are responsible for providing
accurate nonpartisan voting information and assistance to all of the citizens
they are appointed to help. They aid in ensuring citizens understand their
voting rights, to include providing procedures on how to vote absentee.</span></p>

<p><span>6.38.1. The DoD Federal
Voting Assistance Program is responsible for administering the Uniformed and
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act and the Military and Overseas Voter
Empowerment Act. Enacted in 1986, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee
Voting Act protects the right of service members to vote in federal elections
regardless of where they are stationed. This law requires that states and
territories allow members of the U.S. Uniformed Services and merchant marine,
their family members and U.S. citizens residing outside the United States to
register and vote absentee in elections for federal offices.&nbsp;In many
states, laws exist that allow military members and their families to vote
absentee in state and local elections. Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee
Voting Act was expanded significantly in 2009, when Congress passed the
Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act to provide greater protections for
service members, their families and other overseas citizens. Among other provisions,
the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act requires states to transmit
validly-requested absentee ballots to Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee
Voting Act voters no later than 45 days before a federal election, when the
request has been received by that date, except where the state has been granted
an undue hardship waiver approved by the Department of Defense for that
election.</span></p>

<p><span>6.38.2. The DoD Federal
Voting Assistance Program mission is to inform and educate U.S. citizens
worldwide of their right to vote; foster voting participation; and protect the
integrity of and enhance the electoral process at the Federal, state, and local
levels. Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act requires each
federal department and agency with personnel covered by the act to have a
voting assistance program. Critical to the success of this program are the
voting assistance officers. These individuals, military and civilian, are
responsible for providing accurate nonpartisan voting information and
assistance to all of the citizens they are appointed to help. They aid in
ensuring citizens understand their voting rights, to include providing
procedures on how to vote absentee. More information about the Air Force
program can be found in AFI 36-3107,&nbsp;<i>Voting Assistance Program</i>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.39. Dissident and Protest Activities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force commanders
have the inherent authority and responsibility to take action to ensure the
mission is performed and to maintain good order and discipline. This authority
and responsibility includes placing lawful restriction on dissident and protest
activities. Air Force commanders must preserve the service member's right of
expression to the maximum extent possible, consistent with good order,
discipline, and national security. To properly balance these interests,
commanders must exercise calm and prudent judgment and should consult with the
staff judge advocate. For more detail, review AFI 51-903,&nbsp;<i>Dissident and
Protest Activities</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>6.39.1.&nbsp;<b>Possessing or Distributing
Printed Materials.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air
Force members may not distribute or post any printed or written material other
than publications of an official government agency or base-related activity
within any Air Force installation without permission of the installation
commander or that commander's designee. Members who violate this prohibition
are subject to disciplinary action under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><span>6.39.2.&nbsp;<b>Writing for Publications.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force members may
not write for unofficial publications, including blogs and other electronic
social media journalistic forums during duty hours. While unofficial
publication, such as an  underground newspaper,  are not prohibited, they may
not be produced using government or non-appropriated fund property or supplies
on or&nbsp;offduty. Any publication that contains language, the utterance of
which is punishable by the Uniform Code of Military Justice or other federal
laws, may subject a person involved in its printing, publishing, or
distribution to prosecution or other disciplinary action.</span></p>

<p><span>6.39.3.&nbsp;<b>Off-Limits Action.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Action may be initiated
under AFJI 31-213,&nbsp;<i>Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards and
Off-Installation Liaison and Operations,</i>&nbsp;to make certain
establishments off limits. An establishment runs the risk of being off limits
if its activities include counseling service members to refuse to perform their
duties or to desert, or when involved in acts with a significant adverse effect
on health, welfare, or morale of military members.</span></p>

<p><span>6.39.4.&nbsp;<b>Prohibited Activities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Military personnel must
reject participation in organizations that espouse supremacist causes; attempt
to create illegal discrimination based on race, color, gender, religion,
national origin, or ethnic group; advocate the use of force or violence; otherwise
engage in the effort to deprive individuals of their civil rights; or knowingly
wear gang colors, clothes, tattoos, or body markings. Active participation,
such as publicly demonstrating or rallying, fundraising, recruiting and
training members, organizing or leading such organizations, or otherwise
engaging in activities the commander finds to be detrimental to good order,
discipline, or mission accomplishment, is incompatible with military service
and prohibited. Members who violate this prohibition are subject to
disciplinary action under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><span>6.39.5.&nbsp;<b>Demonstrations and Similar
Activities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Demonstrations or other
activities within an Air Force installation that could result in interfering
with or preventing the orderly accomplishment of a mission of the installation
or which present a clear danger to loyalty, discipline, or morale of members of
the Armed Forces are prohibited and are punishable under Article 92 of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice. Air Force members are prohibited from
participating in demonstrations when they are on duty, in a foreign country, in
uniform, involved in activities that constitute a breach of law and order, or
when violence is likely to result.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.40. Public Statements.</span></b></p>

<p><span>When making public
statements, AFI 35-101,&nbsp;<i>Public Affairs Responsibilities and Management,</i>&nbsp;governs
members<i>.</i>&nbsp;Each Air Force member has a personal responsibility for
the success of the Air Force Public Affairs Program. As representatives of the
service in both official and unofficial contact with the public, members have
many opportunities to contribute to positive public opinions toward the Air
Force. Therefore, each person must strive to make contacts show the highest
standards of conduct and reflect the Air Force core values.</span></p>

<p><span>6.40.1.&nbsp;<b>Do.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Specifically, each Air
Force member is responsible for obtaining the necessary review and clearance,
starting with public affairs, before releasing any proposed statement, text, or
imagery to the public. This includes digital products being loaded on an
unrestricted Web site. Members must ensure the information revealed, whether
official or unofficial, is appropriate for release according to classification
requirements in&nbsp;DoDI&nbsp;5200.01,&nbsp;<i>Department of Defense
Information Security Program and Protection of Sensitive Compartmented
Information</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>and AFPD 31-4,&nbsp;<i>Information Security</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>6.40.2.&nbsp;<b>Don t.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force members must
not use their Air Force association, official title, or position to promote,
endorse, or benefit any profit-making agency. This does not prohibit members
from assuming character or modeling roles in commercial advertisement during
their nonduty hours; however, they cannot wear their uniform or allow their Air
Force title or position to be affixed to the advertisement in any manner or
imply Air Force endorsement of the product or service being promoted.
Additionally, they must not make any commitment to provide official Air Force
information to any non-DoD member or agency, including news media, before
obtaining approval through command or public affairs channels.</span></p>

<p><b><span>6.41. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This chapter explained
Air Force standards of conduct. Airmen must learn these standards well enough
to be able to clearly explain them to subordinates, observe these standards,
and always enforce their observation by other members. Used in concert with
information presented in Chapters 5 and 19, this information covered essential
issues vital to good order and discipline and mission effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>ENFORCING STANDARDS AND LEGAL ISSUES Section
7A Overview</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>7.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force commanders at
all levels are required to continuously<i>&nbsp;</i>evaluate force readiness
and organizational economy, efficiency and effectiveness. The inspection system
provides the commander with a credible, independent assessment process to
measure the capabilities of assigned forces. Supervisors at all levels play an
integral part in this process through continual assessment of personnel,
programs and the areas of responsibilities they supervise. Furthermore, when systematic,
programmatic or procedural weaknesses are suspected, or to further ensure
resources are used effectively and efficiently, Airmen at all levels may visit
the Inspector General to report these areas as well as potential fraud, waste
or abuse cases. This chapter provides information on the Air Force Inspection
System, the Inspector General Complaints Program, and individual standards and
punitive actions. All four areas are necessary to enable the Air Force to
fulfill our national security obligations efficiently and effectively.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 7B Air Force
Inspection System</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>7.2. Purpose.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Inspectors General
mission is defined in headquarters Air Force mission directive 1-20,&nbsp;<i>The
Inspector General</i>, and AFPD 90-2,&nbsp;<i>Inspector General   The
Inspection System</i>. The overall purpose of the Air Force inspection system
is to enable and strengthen commanders' effectiveness and efficiency, motivate
and promote military discipline, improve unit performance and management
excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and staffs, as well as
identify issues interfering with effectiveness, efficiency, compliance,
discipline, readiness, performance, surety and management excellence. The
Inspectors General reports on readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline
of Air Force organizations to the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of
Staff of the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.3. Philosophy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Inspection is an
inherent function of command exercised at every level to evaluate readiness,
economy, efficiency and state of discipline. Inspection preparation, if not
directly aligned with mission readiness, is inherently wasteful. Units will be
inspection ready when commander's focus on mission readiness and on building a
culture of disciplined compliance in which every Airmen does their job right
the first time even when no one's looking. The intent of the Inspector General
is to continuously improve the Air Force inspection system so there is an
ever-shrinking difference   both real and perceived   between mission readiness
and inspection readiness. Each major command commander and Wing commander will
appoint an Inspector General who will establish an inspection program
consistent with major command mission requirements to inspect unit
effectiveness, surety and other inspection program elements. Major Command
Inspectors General establish inspection programs consistent with command
mission requirements and in accordance with this instruction to assess unit
readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.4. Inspection Types:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Commander s
Inspection Program.</b>&nbsp;A validated and trusted commander's inspection
program is the cornerstone of the Air Force inspection system. The Wing
Inspector General is responsible to validate and verify self-assessment
programs and independently assess the performance of organizations below the
Wing level. The commander's inspection program should give the Wing Commander,
subordinate commanders and wing Airmen the right information at the right time
to assess risk, identify areas of improvement, determine root cause and
precisely focus limited resources; all aligned with the commander's priorities
and on the commander's timeline. The commander's inspection program also
facilitates requests for targeted assistance from the major command commander
and staff when and where needed. The commander's inspection program produces
two key components: (1) the self-assessment program; and (2) the Wing s
Inspection Program executed under the authority of the Wing Inspector General
to validate and verify commander self-assessments are accurate and timely, and
independently assess effectiveness of subordinate units and programs. These
components provide critical data to leadership about the adequacy of policy,
training, manpower, funds, equipment, and facilities.</span></p>

<p><span>7.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Unit
Effectiveness Inspection.</b>&nbsp;The unit effectiveness inspection integrates
elements of compliance and readiness using specific Inspector General
Inspection elements to assess the effectiveness of a unit. Conducted by Major
Command Inspectors General and the Air Force Inspection Agency on Wings and
Wing-equivalents, the unit effectiveness inspection is a continual evaluation
of performance throughout the inspection period. This is a photo album versus a
snapshot. The unit effectiveness inspection inspects the following four Major
Graded Areas: Managing Resources, Leading People, Improving the Unit, and
Executing the Mission. The unit effectiveness inspection validates and verifies
a wing commander's inspection program for accuracy and adequacy, and provides
an independent assessment of the Wing's resource management, leadership,
process improvement efforts and ability to execute the mission. A unit
effectiveness inspection is a multi-year, continual inspection of the unit s
effectiveness, and is intended to help the wing commander understand the areas
of greatest risk from undetected non-compliance. The next inspection period
begins immediately following the Unit Effectiveness Inspection Capstone event.</span></p>

<p><span>7.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Nuclear
Surety Inspection.&nbsp;</b>Nuclear Surety Inspections are an integral part of
the Air Force Inspection System and are considered a snapshot within a wing s
Unit Effectiveness Inspection cycle. Major Command Inspector General's use
performance and compliance-based inspections to evaluate a unit's ability to
manage nuclear resources while complying with all nuclear surety standards.
Additionally, during a Nuclear Surety Inspection a unit's capability to safely
and reliably receive, store, secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate,
lock/unlock, test, render safe and employ nuclear weapons is evaluated.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.5. Inspection Elements:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Self-Assessment
Program.</b>&nbsp;Led by unit commanders in accordance with Title 10, United
States Code, Section 8583, the self-assessment program provides commanders with
a means for internal assessment of a Wing's overall health and complements
external assessments. The primary purpose of the self-assessment program for
the commander is to accurately identify and report issues to the command chain.
Self-Assessment programs may include a wide variety of internal assessments or
evaluations. At a minimum, Commanders must utilize Management Internal Control
Toolset and applicable self-assessment communicators. Commanders are encouraged
to include additional measures as directed by superior Commanders, functional
directives, or proven lessons and experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Management
Internal Control Toolset.</b>&nbsp;Management Internal Control Toolset is an
Air Force program of record used to facilitate self-assessments and communicate
compliance, risk and program health. Management Internal Control Toolset
provides the supervisor and command chain, from Squadron Commander to Secretary
of the Air Force, tiered visibility into user-selected compliance reports and
program status. Management Internal Control Toolset also allows functional area
managers the ability to virtually monitor unit performance and status.
Additionally, Management Internal Control Toolset can assist Inspectors General
by informing the risk-based sampling strategy and formulating specific
inspection methodology and Inspector General Team composition for the
commander's inspection program and on-site unit effectiveness inspection
events.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.5.3.<b>&nbsp;Self-Assessment
Communicator.</b>&nbsp;A Self-Assessment Communicator is a two-way communication
tool designed to improve compliance with published guidance and communicate
risk and program health up and down the chain of command in near real-time.
Compliance with a self-assessment communicator does not relieve individual
Airmen from complying with all statutory and regulatory requirements in Air
Force instructions and directives at the local, state or federal level. As a
self-assessment tool, Self-Assessment Communicators ask Airmen at the
shop-level to self-report compliance or non-compliance. While the responses are
assumed to be truthful and timely, self-assessment communicators are frequently
verified for accuracy and currency by wing Inspectors General and major command
Inspectors General.</span></p>

<p><span>7.5.4.<b>&nbsp;Inspector
General's Evaluation Management System.</b>&nbsp;The Inspectors General
Evaluation Management System is the official program of record for the Air
Force Inspection System. Inspectors General will use Inspectors General
Evaluation Management System to record the unit's overall rating, identify deficiencies,
track corrective action plans, and post the final inspection report.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.6. Gatekeeper Program.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Gatekeeper program
is used to build schedules, synchronize and align Air Force and non-Air Force
inspection requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 7C Inspector General
Complaints Program</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>7.7. Program Policy and Mission Focus.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force Inspector
General Complaints program is a leadership tool that indicates where command
involvement is needed to correct systematic, programmatic, or procedural
weaknesses. The program also ensures effective and efficient use of resources;
resolves problems affecting the Air Force mission promptly and objectively;
creates an atmosphere of trust in which issues can be objectively and fully
resolved without retaliation or fear of reprisal; and assists commanders in
instilling confidence in Air Force leadership. The primary charge of the
Inspector General is to sustain a credible Air Force Inspector General system
by ensuring the existence of responsive complaint investigations, and fraud,
waste, and abuse programs characterized by objectivity, integrity, and
impartiality. Only the Inspector General may investigate allegations of
reprisal and restriction under the Military Whistleblower's Protection Act. The
Inspector General ensures the concerns of Regular Air Force, Reserve, and Guard
members; civilian employees; family members; retirees; and the best interests
of the Air Force are addressed through objective fact-finding.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.8. Installation Inspector General Program.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The concept of separate,
full-time installation Inspectors General was implemented to remove any
perceived conflict of interest, lack of independence, or apprehension by Air
Force personnel. This came as a result of the previous practice of assigning a
chain of command and Inspector General roles to the same official. The
installation Inspector General is organized as a staff function reporting
directly to the installation commander.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.1.<b>&nbsp;Inspector
General Role.&nbsp;</b>Inspectors General are the  eyes and ears' of the
commander. They execute the commander's inspection program, validating and
verifying unit self-assessments and providing the commander an independent
assessment of unit effectiveness: (1) they inform the commander of potential
areas of concern as reflected by trends; (2) function as the fact finder and
honest broker in the resolution of complaints; (3) educate and train commanders
and members of the base population on their rights and responsibilities in
regard to the Air Force Inspector General system; and (4) help commanders
prevent, detect, and correct fraud, waste and abuse; and mismanagement.
Personal complaints and fraud, waste, and abuse disclosures help commanders
discover and correct problems that affect the productivity and morale of
assigned personnel. Resolving the underlying cause of a complaint may prevent
more severe symptoms or costly consequences, such as reduced performance,
accidents, poor quality work, poor morale, or loss of resources. Even though
allegations may not be substantiated, the evidence or investigation findings
may reveal systemic morale or other problems that impede efficiency and mission
effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.2.<b>&nbsp;Investigations Not Covered and
Complaints Not Appropriate.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The following are not
covered under the Inspector General Complaint Resolution program:</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.2.1. Administrative
inquiries or investigations governed by other policy directives and
instructions. These inquiries and investigations include:</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.2.1.1.
Commander-directed inquiries and investigations.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.2.1.2. Air Force
Office of Special Investigations or security forces investigations.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.2.1.3.
Investigations of civilian employees who have specific appeal rights under law
or labor union agreements.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.2.2. Investigations
under the authority of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) or the&nbsp;<i>Manual
for Courts-Martial</i>, line of duty or report of survey investigations,
quality assurance in the Air Force medical service boards, Air Force mishap or
safety investigations, military equal opportunity treatment or civilian equal employment
opportunity programs, and medical incident investigations.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.2.3. Matters
normally addressed through other established grievance or appeal channels
unless there is evidence these channels mishandled the matter or process. If a
policy directive or instruction provides a specific means of redress or appeal
to a grievance, complainants must exhaust these means before filing an
Inspector General complaint. Complainants must provide some relevant evidence
that the process was mishandled or handled prejudicially before an Inspector
General channel will process a complaint of mishandling. Dissatisfaction or
disagreement with the outcome or findings of an alternative grievance or appeal
process is not a sufficient basis to warrant an Inspector General investigation.&nbsp;<b>Note:<i>&nbsp;</i></b>AFI
90-301,&nbsp;<i>Inspector General Complaints Resolution</i>, Table 3.6, assists
Inspectors General in determining if a complaint belongs in other channels.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.3.<b>&nbsp;Filing an Inspector General
Complaint.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force military
members and civilian employees have a duty to promptly report fraud, waste and
abuse or gross mismanagement; a violation of law, policy, procedures, or
regulations; an injustice; abuse of authority, inappropriate conduct, or
misconduct; and a deficiency or like condition to an appropriate supervisor or
commander, to an Inspector General or other appropriate inspector, or through
an established grievance channel. Complainants should attempt to resolve the
issues at the lowest possible level using command channels before addressing them
to a higher level or the Inspector General. The immediate supervisory command
chain can often resolve complaints more quickly and effectively than a higher
level not familiar with the situation. Use the Inspector General system when
referral to the chain of command is futile, and there is fear of reprisal.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.4.<b>&nbsp;Procedures for Filing a
Complaint.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Table 7.1 outlines the
procedures for filing an Inspector General complaint. Complainants complete an
Air Force Form 102,<i>&nbsp;Inspector General Personal and Fraud, Waste and
Abuse Complaint Registration</i>,<b>&nbsp;</b>briefly outlining the facts and
relevant background information related to the issue or complaint. AFI 90-301<i>&nbsp;</i>outlines
the procedures. Complainants may also file anonymously through an Air Force
fraud, waste, and abuse hotline, the Defense hotline, or directly with an
Inspector General.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.<b>&nbsp;Complainants' Rights.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Complainants have the
right to:</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.1. File an
Inspector General complaint at any level without notifying or following the
chain of command.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.2. File a
complaint with an Inspector General without fear of reprisal.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.3. Request
withdrawal of their complaint in writing; however, Inspectors General may still
look into the allegations at their discretion.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.4. Request the
next higher level Inspector General review their case within 90 days of
receiving a final Inspector General response. Must give specific reasons as to
why the complainant believes the original investigation was not valid or
adequate; simply disagreeing with the findings is not sufficient for an
additional Inspector General review.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.5. Submit
complaints anonymously.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.6. Submit a
complaint on behalf of another individual or even when not the wronged party.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.7. Request
whistleblower protection after making or planning to make a protected
communication.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.7.1. Reprisal occurs
when a responsible management official<i>&nbsp;</i>takes (or threatens to take)
an unfavorable personnel action; or withholds (or threatens to withhold) a
favorable personnel action, to retaliate against a member of the armed forces
who made, or prepared to make, a protected communication. Any lawful
communication, regardless of the subject, to an Inspector General or Congress,
is considered protected. Additionally, this type of communication is protected
when a member who reasonably believes he/she has evidence of a violation of law
or regulation<i>&nbsp;</i>(regardless of whether he/she is the victim),
discloses this to an authorized recipient in the form of a lawful
communication.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.7.2.
Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034,&nbsp;<i>Protected Communications;
Prohibition of Retaliatory Personnel Actions</i>, also states that a military
member may not be restricted<i>&nbsp;</i>or prohibited from making a lawful
communication to the Inspector General or a member of Congress (for example,
making a protected communication). Restriction can result from either private
or public statements that may reasonably discourage Air</span></p>

<p><span>Force members from
contacting the Inspector General or a member of Congress. For example, a first
sergeant who</span></p>

<p><span>directs a member to stay
within his chain of command because the member told his supervisor he was going
to complain to his Congressman about an upcoming deployment has probably
restricted.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.5.7.3. The
Department of Defense Inspector General provides a quarterly report to Congress
detailing the Services' Inspector General allegations of reprisal, and
restricted (if substantiated, amounts to a violation of Federal law). In the
Air Force, most allegations in these areas are against First Sergeants and
senior enlisted personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.6.<b>&nbsp;Complainants' Responsibilities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Complainants must file
within one year of learning of the alleged wrong. Inspector General complaints
not reported within one year may seriously impede the gathering of evidence and
testimony. The Inspector General may dismiss a complaint if, given the nature
of the alleged wrong and the passage of time, there is reasonable probability
that insufficient information can be gathered to make a determination, or no
special Air Force interests exist to justify investigating the matter.
Complainants must cooperate with investigators by providing factual and
relevant information regarding the issues. Complainants must understand that
they are submitting official statements; therefore, they remain subject to
punitive action for knowingly making false statements and submitting other
unlawful communications.</span></p>

<p><span>7.8.7.<b>&nbsp;Confidentiality Policy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
Inspector General makes every effort to protect the identity of complainants
from anyone outside Inspector General channels. Inspectors General may release
the name of a complainant only on an official need-to-know basis.</span></p>

<p><span>Investigating officers
do not divulge a complainant's name to a subject or witness or permit them to
read the complaint without the Inspectors General or appointing authority s
written permission.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 7D Individual
Standards</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>7.9. Enforcing Individual Standards.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Commanders, supervisors,
and other persons in authority can issue administrative counseling,
admonitions, and reprimands. These actions are intended to improve, correct,
and instruct subordinates who depart from standards of performance, conduct,
bearing, and integrity, on or off duty, and whose actions degrade the
individual and unit's mission. Written administrative counseling, admonitions,
and reprimands are subject to the rules of access, protection, and disclosure
outlined in the Privacy Act of 1974. The same rules apply to copies kept by
supervisors and commanders and those filed in an individual's unfavorable
information file or the unit's personnel information file. Raters must consider
making comments on performance reports when the ratee receives any of these
adverse actions. The following paragraphs discuss actions a commander may take
to correct an individual's behavior without resorting to punishment under the
UCMJ.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.10. Administrative Counseling, Admonitions,
and Reprimands.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Administrative
counseling, admonitions, and reprimands are quality force management tools
available to supervisors, superiors, and commanders. These tools are corrective
in nature, not punitive. When properly used, they help maintain established Air
Force standards and enhance mission accomplishment. When a member departs from
standards, there are many factors to consider in determining what action, if
any, is appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.1.&nbsp;<b>AFI 36-2907, Unfavorable
Information File (UIF) Program.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.10.1.1. Chapter 4
contains guidance on administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands.
The decision to issue a letter of counseling, admonition, or reprimand should
be based primarily on two factors.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.1.1.1. First is the
nature of the incident. Administrative counseling, admonitions, and reprimands
may be administered for any departure from Air Force standards. Unlike
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, they are NOT limited to
offenses punishable by the UCMJ. (These disciplinary measures may also be
issued to Reserve members who commit an offense while in civilian (non-Title
10) status.) The seriousness of the departure should be considered before
deciding what type of action is appropriate to take.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.1.1.2. Second is
the previous disciplinary record of the member. Counseling, admonitions, and
reprimands should be used as part of a graduated pattern of discipline in
response to repeated departures from standards. In other words, each time a
service member departs from standards, the response should usually be more
severe.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Standard
of Proof</b>. While no specific standard of proof applies to administrative
action proceedings, commanders should utilize the  preponderance of the
evidence  standard when evaluating the evidence and every element of the
offenses committed. A preponderance of the evidence means simply the greater
weight of credible evidence. Whether such proof is available should be
considered before initiating the administrative action. If such proof is
lacking, administrative action is susceptible to being found to be legally
unsupportable and, as a result, could be set aside. There is no requirement to
prove any allegation beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>

<p><span>7.10.2.&nbsp;<b>Letter of Counseling and Air
Force IMT 174, Record of Individual Counseling.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A letter of counseling
is the lowest level of administrative action. Counseling helps people develop
good judgment, assume responsibility, and face and solve their problems.
Counselors help subordinates develop skills, attitudes, and behaviors
consistent with maintaining the Air Force readiness. First-line supervisors,
first sergeants, and commanders routinely counsel individuals verbally or in
writing, giving advice and reassuring subordinates about specific situations. A
verbal counseling may be recorded on a record of individual counseling.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.3.&nbsp;<b>Letter of Admonishment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>An admonishment is more
severe than a letter of counseling or a record of individual counseling. Use an
admonishment to document an infraction serious enough to warrant a letter of
admonishment. Do not use it when a reprimand is more appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.4.&nbsp;<b>Letter of Reprimand.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A reprimand is more
severe than a letter of counseling or letter of admonishment and indicates a
stronger degree of official censure. Commanders may elect to file a letter of
reprimand in a UIF for enlisted personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.5.&nbsp;<b>Issuing the Letter of
Counseling, Record of Individual Counseling, Letter of Admonishments, or Letter
of Reprimands.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Counseling, admonitions,
and reprimands may be either verbal or written. The counseling, admonition, or
reprimand should be in writing because the corrective action is more meaningful
to the member and the infraction is documented. Letter of counseling, letter of
admonishments and letter of reprimands should be typed on letterhead and must
comply with the requirements listed below. Failure to follow the requirements
for drafting and maintaining these documents could limit the use of the
documents in a subsequent proceeding. Failing to include the second endorsement
noting the consideration of a response, for example, will likely render a
letter of reprimand inadmissible in a later court-martial or discharge
proceeding.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.6. Written letter
of counseling, letter of admonishments and letter of reprimands must state the
following:</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.6.1. What the
member did or failed to do, citing specific incidents and their dates.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.6.2. What
improvement is expected.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.6.3. That further
deviation may result in more severe action.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.6.4. That the
individual has 3 duty days to respond and provide rebuttal matters (45 days for
non-extended Regular Air Force reservists).</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.6.5. That all
supporting documents become part of the record.</span></p>

<p><span>7.10.6.6. That the
person who initiates the letter of counseling, letter of admonishments and
letter of reprimands has three duty days to advise the individual of their
decision regarding any comments submitted by the individual.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.11. UIF</span></b><span>.</span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>The UIF provides
commanders with an official and single means of filing derogatory data
concerning an Air Force member's personal conduct and duty performance. With
some exceptions, the commander has wide discretion as to what should be placed
in a UIF and what should be removed.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.1.&nbsp;<b>Mandatory Documents.&nbsp;</b>(See AFI
36-2907, Table 2.2 for additional guidance relating to mandatory UIFs)<b>&nbsp;</b>The
commander must place</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>the following documents</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>in a UIF:</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.1.1. Suspended or
unsuspended Article 15 punishment of more than 1 month (31 days or more).</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.1.2. Court-martial
conviction.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.1.3. A civilian
conviction where the penalty or actions equivalent to a finding of guilty of an
offense which resulted in confinement of 1 year or more or could have resulted
in a penalty of confinement for more than one year or death.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.1.4. Control roster
actions (see paragraph 7.12).</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.2.&nbsp;<b>Optional Documents.</b>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>The commander may place
the following documents, among others, into a UIF for up to one year:</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.2.1. Article 15
when punishment is not suspended or does not exceed one month.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.2.2. A record of
conviction by a civilian court or an action equivalent to a finding of guilty
for an offense where the maximum confinement penalty authorized for the offense
is one year or less.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.2.3. Written
letters of reprimand, admonition, or counseling.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.2.4. Confirmed
incidents involving discrimination or sexual harassment of personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.3.&nbsp;<b>Initiating and Controlling UIFs.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Commanders at all
levels; vice commanders, staff directors, and directors at major commands,
field operating agencies, and direct reporting units; and the senior Air Force
officer assigned to a joint command have the authority to establish, remove, or
destroy UIFs. Commanders refer optional documents (letters of admonishment,
letters of counseling, and letters of reprimand) to the offending member along
with an Air Force IMT 1058,&nbsp;<i>Unfavorable Information File Action</i>,
before establishing a UIF.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Mandatory items, such as
Articles 15 with punishment exceeding 1 month and court-martial or civilian
court convictions, are not referred via Air Force IMT 1058. The individual has
3 duty days to acknowledge the intended actions and provide pertinent
information before the commander makes the final decision on placing optional
documents in the UIF. The commander advises the individual of his or her final
decision; and, if the commander decides to file the information in a UIF, the
individual's response is also filed.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.4.&nbsp;<b>Accessing
and Reviewing UIFs:</b>&nbsp;7.11.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In the course of their
Air Force duties, the following individuals are authorized access to a member s
UIF: the member, commander, first sergeant, enlisted performance report
reporting and rating officials, force support squadron personnel, Inspector
General, inspection team, legal office personnel, military equal opportunity
personnel, law enforcement personnel and substance abuse counselors authorized
by the commander to review the document in the course of their official Air
Force duties.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.4.2. All UIFs
require periodic review to ensure continued maintenance of documents in the UIF
is proper. The unit commander must review all UIFs within 90 days of assuming
or being appointed to command. UIFs are also reviewed when individuals are
considered for promotion, reenlistment, permanent change of station, permanent change
of assignment, and voluntary or mandatory reclassification or retraining. UIFs
are also reviewed annually, with the assistance of the staff judge advocate.</span></p>

<p><span>7.11.5.&nbsp;<b>Removing UIFs or Documents
within UIFs.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Commanders
keep the UIF and documents for the disposition period unless early removal is
clearly warranted. AFI 36-2907,&nbsp;<i>Unfavorable Information File (UIF)
Program,</i>&nbsp;contains additional guidance on disposition dates.</span></p>

<p><span>Commanders initiate
removal action via Air Force IMT 1058, and the individual acknowledges the
action.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.12. Control Roster.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The control roster is a
rehabilitative tool commanders may use to establish a 6-month observation
period for individuals whose duty performance is substandard or who fail to
meet or maintain Air Force standards of conduct, bearing, and integrity, on or
off duty. A single incident of substandard performance or an isolated breach of
standards, not likely to be repeated, should not ordinarily be a basis for a
control roster action. Commanders should consider prior incidents, acts,
failures, counseling, and rehabilitative efforts.</span></p>

<p><span>7.12.1.<b>&nbsp;Use.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A commander may direct
an enlisted performance report before entering or removing an individual from
the roster, or both. The commander cannot place an individual on the roster as
a substitute for more appropriate administrative, judicial, or nonjudicial
action. Being on the roster does not shield an individual from other actions.
An individual cannot remain on the roster for more than 6 consecutive months.
If a member is not rehabilitated in this time, the commander initiates more
severe action.</span></p>

<p><span>7.12.2.&nbsp;<b>Initiating and Maintaining the
Control Roster.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Commanders place an
individual on the control roster by using Air Force IMT 1058, which puts the
member on notice that his/her performance and behavior must improve or he/she
will face more severe administrative action or punishment. The individual
acknowledge receipt of the action and has 3 duty days to respond and submit a
statement on his or her behalf before the Air Force IMT 1058 is finalized.&nbsp;Placement
on the control roster is a mandatory UIF entry. The 6-month time period begins
the day the Air Force IMT 1058 is finalized and ends at 2400 hours 6 months
later. For example, if placed on the roster 1 January, this action expires at
2400 on 30 June. An individual's time does not stop and start for periods of
temporary duty, ordinary leave, or a change in immediate supervisor. The
commander can remove an enlisted member early from the control roster using Air
Force IMT 1058.</span></p>



<p><b><span>7.13. Administrative Demotion of Airmen.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The group or
equivalent-level commander may demote Master Sergeants and below. Major
command, field operating agency, and direct reporting unit commanders may
demote Senior Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeants.</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.1.&nbsp;<b>Reasons for Demotion.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Common reasons for the
administrative demotion of Airmen include failure to:</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.1.1. Complete
officer transitional training for reasons of academic deficiency,
self-elimination, or misconduct. Trainees will be demoted to the grade they
formerly held.</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.1.2. Maintain or
attain the appropriate grade and skill level.</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.1.3. Fulfill the
responsibilities of a noncommissioned officer (NCO) as prescribed in AFI
36-2618,&nbsp;<i>The Officer and Enlisted Force Structures</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.1.4. Attain or
maintain fitness program standards as prescribed in AFI 36-2905,&nbsp;<i>Fitness
Program</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.1.5. Termination of
student status of members attending temporary duty Air Force schools.</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.2.&nbsp;<b>Demotion Procedure:<i>&nbsp;</i></b>7.13.2.1. The
immediate commander notifies the member in writing of the intention to
recommend demotion, citing the paragraph, the demotion authority if other than
the initiating commander, and the recommended grade. The notification must also
include the specific reasons for the demotion and a complete summary of the
supporting facts. 7.13.2.2. The commander informs the member of their right to
counsel and the right to respond within 3 duty days.</span></p>

<p><span>The commander must also
inform eligible members of their right to apply for retirement in lieu of
demotion. Following the member's response, if the commander elects to continue
the proceedings, the case file is forwarded with a summary of the member s
written and verbal statements to the force support squadron for processing
prior to forwarding to the demotion authority. The member must be notified in
writing of the decision to forward the action to the demotion authority. The
demotion authority obtains a written legal review before making a decision.</span></p>

<p><span>7.13.3.&nbsp;<b>Appeal Policy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen may appeal a
demotion decision. The appellate authority for Airmen in the grades of Airman
through Master Sergeant is the next level commander above the group commander.
The appellate authority for Airmen in the grades of Senior Master Sergeant and
Chief Master Sergeant is the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, unless the major
command, field operating agency, or direct reporting unit commander delegated
demotion authority to a subordinate level. If delegated, the major command,
field operating agency, or direct reporting unit commander then becomes the
appellate authority for demotion appeals of Senior Master Sergeants and Chief
Master Sergeants.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.14. Administrative Separations.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The suitability of
persons to serve in the Air Force is judged on the basis of their conduct and
their ability to meet required standards of duty performance and discipline.
Separating members failing to meet standards of performance, conduct, or
discipline, promotes Air Force readiness and strengthens our standards of
military service. Commanders and supervisors must identify enlisted members who
show likelihood for early separation and make reasonable efforts to help these
members meet Air Force standards. Members who do not show potential for further
service should be discharged. Commanders must consult the servicing staff judge
advocate and military personnel flight before initiating the involuntary
separation of a member.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.1.&nbsp;<b>Service Characterization.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen who do not
qualify for reenlistment receive a discharge without regard to their remaining
Military Service Obligation. The character of the member's service is
honorable. The service of members separating at their expiration of term of
service, or voluntarily or involuntarily separating for the convenience of the
Government, is characterized as honorable. The service of members
administratively discharged under AFI 36-3208,&nbsp;<i>Administrative
Separation of Airmen,</i>&nbsp;may be characterized as honorable, general
(under honorable conditions), or under other than honorable conditions. The
service characterization depends upon the reason for the discharge and the
member's military record in the current enlistment or period of service.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.1.1. Honorable:
Appropriate when the quality of the member's service generally has met Air
Force standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty, or a member s
service is otherwise so meritorious that any other characterization would be
inappropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.1.2. General (under
honorable conditions): Appropriate if a member's service has been honest and
faithful, but significant negative aspects of the member's conduct or
performance outweigh positive aspects of military record.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.1.3. Under Other
Than Honorable Conditions: Appropriate if based on a pattern of behavior or one
or more acts or omissions constituting a significant departure from the conduct
expected of Airmen. This characterization can be given only if the member is
offered an administrative discharge board or if a discharge is unconditionally
requested in lieu of trial by court-martial.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.1.4. A commander
must initiate discharge processing or seek a waiver of the discharge if the
reason for discharge is for fraudulent or erroneous enlistment; civil court
conviction for an offense for which a punitive discharge and confinement for
one year or more would be authorized under the UCMJ; drug abuse; or sexual
assault. A commander must make a discharge or retention recommendation when a
member remains in a poor fitness category for a continuous 12-month period or
receives 4 poor fitness assessments in a 24-month period.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.2.&nbsp;<b>Reasons for Separation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen are entitled to
separate at expiration of term of service unless there is a specific authority
for retention or they consent to retention. Nevertheless, a separation is not
automatic; members remain in the service until separation action is initiated.
Many different reasons for separation exist. The following discussion cannot
cover all of them; its purpose is to briefly identify major reasons for
separation and a concise discussion of each:</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Required Separation:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.14.2.1.1. Airmen who
will continue to serve in another military status must separate; for example,
an Airman may separate to serve with the Air Force Reserve or Air National
Guard. An Airman may also separate to accept an appointment as a commissioned
officer of the Air Force or to accept an appointment as a warrant or
commissioned officer of another branch of service.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.2.1.2. Airmen with
insufficient retainability for permanent change of station must separate.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Voluntary
Separation.&nbsp;</b>Airmen may ask for early separation for the convenience of
the Government if they meet the criteria. Entering an officer training program,
pregnancy, conscientious objection, hardship, and early release to attend
school are some of the reasons for which members may be allowed to separate.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Involuntary
Separation.&nbsp;</b>Physical conditions that interfere with duty performance
or assignment availability, inability to cope with parental responsibilities or
military duty, or insufficient retainability for required retraining are
reasons for involuntary discharge for the convenience of the Government.
Defective enlistment (fraudulent or erroneous) is also a basis for discharge.
Airmen are subject to discharge for cause based on such factors as
unsatisfactory performance, substance abuse, misconduct, or in the interest of
national security.</span></p>

<p><span>7.14.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Discharge
Instead of Trial by Court-Martial.&nbsp;</b>If charges have been preferred
against an Airman and if the UCMJ authorizes punitive discharge as punishment
for the offense, the Airman may request an administrative discharge instead of
trial by court-martial. There is no guarantee, however, that the Airman's request
will be granted.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 7E Punitive
Actions</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>7.15. Military Law, a</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Separate Judicial System.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Effective leadership is
the most desirable means of maintaining standards. Military law provides
commanders the tools, including court-martial and nonjudicial punishment, to
deal with criminal conduct. The purpose of military law is</span></p>

System Pillars.</span></b></p>

<p><span>to promote justice, to assist in maintaining
good order and discipline in the Armed Forces, to promote efficiency and effectiveness
in the military establishment, and to thereby strengthen the national security
of the U.S.</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.1.&nbsp;<b>The U.S. Constitution.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The U.S. Constitution is the primary source of our military law.
The framers of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the authority to make rules
for the military, and Congress and the President have used their combined
authority to create the military justice system currently in place (Figure
7.1). The U.S. Constitution designates the President as Commander in Chief of
the Armed Forces and vests the power to carry out the responsibilities of this
position. Congress has the power to raise an Army and Navy, control the
military budget, and make rules for the government of the Army and Navy. This
separation of power is an important element of our military justice system.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>7.15.2.<b>&nbsp;UCMJ and the Manual for
Courts-Martial:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.15.2.1.<b>&nbsp;UCMJ.&nbsp;</b>In
1950, Congress enacted the UCMJ, and President Harry S. Truman signed it into
law. The UCMJ became effective 31 May 1951.</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.2.2.&nbsp;<b>The
Manual for Courts-Martial.&nbsp;</b>In 1951, President Truman created the
Manual for Courts-Martial by executive order. The Manual for Courts-Martial
sets out rules for evidence, procedure, maximum punishments, and provides
standardized forms. The Manual for Courts-Martial is intended to provide
military law guidance to commanders and judge advocates and is revised
annually. Furthermore, the manual contains a wide range of materials, including
the U.S. Constitution, the UCMJ (including text and discussion of the punitive articles,
as well as sample specifications), rules for courts-martial, and military rules
of evidence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.<b>&nbsp;Legal Rights.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Members of the Armed
Forces retain virtually all the legal rights they held as civilians before
entering the military, including protection against involuntary
self-incrimination and the right to counsel.</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Self-incrimination:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Involuntary
Self-incrimination</b></span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states
that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against him or herself.
Article 31, UCMJ, and military rules of evidence 304 reflect this right and
prohibit involuntary statements from being used against an accused. A statement
is  involuntary  when obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, Article 31,
or through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement. The
UCMJ requires that prior to interrogation or any requests for a statement from
a person suspected of an offense, the person must be first told of the nature
of the accusation, advised that he or she does not have to make any statement
regarding the offense, and that any statement he or she makes may be used as
evidence against him or her in a trial by court-martial. Prior to
interrogation, the suspect is entitled to consult with counsel and to have such
counsel present at the interrogation. If counsel is requested, questioning must
cease until counsel is present.</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Statements.&nbsp;</b>Once
properly advised of his or her rights, a person may waive these rights and
choose to make a statement. Assuming this waiver is made freely, knowingly, and
intelligently, any subsequent statement can be used as evidence in a
court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceedings.</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Right to Counsel:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.2.1.
The UCMJ provides an accused the right to be represented by a military attorney
before summary, special, and general courts-martial; Article 32 preliminary
hearings; and in the Article 15 process free of charge.</span></p>

<p><span>The area defense counsel
program provides Air Force members independent legal representation. Airmen
suspected of an offense or facing adverse administrative actions receive
confidential legal advice from an experienced judge advocate general outside
the local chain of command, avoiding conflicts of interest or command influence.</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.2.2. The area
defense counsel program, established in 1974, made the Air Force the first
service to create a totally independent defense function. Area defense counsel
are assigned to the Air Force Judiciary, which falls under the Air Force Legal
Operations Agency at Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington. Although
located at most major bases, the area defense counsel works for a separate
chain of command and reports only to senior defense attorneys. The area defense
counsel does not report to anyone at base level, including the wing commander
and the base staff judge advocate. This separate chain of command ensures
undivided loyalty to the client.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.2.3. Area defense
counsel work to protect a client's individual interests and ensure the
independent and zealous representation of a client facing military justice
action or other adverse actions, thereby promoting discipline and strengthening
confidence in justice. Most area defense counsel are selected from the local
base legal office, but to ensure further independence, they are not rotated
back to the base legal office when their area defense counsel assignments are
completed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.15.3.2.4. Before
selection as an area defense counsel, a judge advocate will be carefully
screened for the proper level of judgment, advocacy skills, and courtroom
experience. Additionally, other experienced trial advocates (senior defense
counsel) travel to assist in the defense of particularly complex
courts-martial. Area defense counsel are supported by defense paralegals, who
are enlisted personnel.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.16. Military Jurisdiction in Action:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.<b>&nbsp;Apprehension and Pretrial
Restraint:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Apprehension.&nbsp;</b>Apprehension
is the act of taking a person into custody and the equivalent of a civilian
 arrest.  Military law enforcement officers, military criminal investigators
and persons on guard or performing police duties are authorized to apprehend
persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, and arrest and temporarily detain persons
subject to the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act, when there is
probable cause that an offense has been committed and that the person committed
it. Although all commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers on
Regular Air Force may apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, absent
exigent circumstances, the apprehension of civilians should be done by law
enforcement personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.1.1. An
apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person orally or in writing that
he or she is in custody. The simple statement,  You are under apprehension,  is
usually sufficient to provide notice. During apprehension, such force and means
as are reasonably necessary under the circumstances to effect the apprehension
are authorized.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.1.2. NCOs not
otherwise performing law enforcement duties may apprehend commissioned or
warrant officers only on specific orders from a commissioned officer or when
such apprehension prevents disgrace to the service or to prevent the commission
of a serious offense or escape of someone who has committed a serious offense.
The immediate commander of an apprehended person should be promptly
notified.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Pretrial
Restraint.&nbsp;</b>Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a
person's liberty that is imposed before and during the disposition of offenses.
Pretrial restraint may include conditions on liberty, restrictions, arrest, or
confinement. Only an officer's commander can order pretrial restraint of an
officer; this authority cannot be delegated. Any commissioned officer may order
pretrial restraint of any enlisted person. An enlisted person's commander may
also delegate such restraint authority to an NCO.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Conditions
on Liberty.&nbsp;</b>Conditions on liberty are imposed directing a person to do
or refrain from doing specified acts; examples include orders to report
periodically to a specified official, orders to stay away from a certain place
(such as the scene of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with
specified persons (such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). However,
conditions on liberty must not hinder pretrial preparation.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Restrictions
in Lieu of Arrest.&nbsp;</b>Restriction imposes restraint on a person to remain
within specified limits, but is less severe than arrest. The geographic limits
are usually broader (for example, restriction to the limits of the
installation), and the offender will perform full military duties unless
otherwise directed.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Arrest.&nbsp;</b>In
the Armed Forces, the term  arrest  means the limiting of a person's liberty.
Arrest is not imposed as punishment for an offense. The notification of arrest
directs a person to remain within specified limits. Arrest is a moral
restraint; no physical restraint is exercised to prevent a person from breaking
arrest. A person in arrest is not expected to perform full military duties.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Confinement.&nbsp;</b>Confinement
is physical restraint, such as imprisonment in a confinement facility.
Individuals are put in pretrial confinement only when lesser forms of pretrial
restraint are inadequate. When a person is ordered into confinement they have
the right to retain civilian counsel (at their own expense) or to request
military counsel be assigned (at no expense to the accused). They also have the
right to a prompt review of their status.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Use of
Pretrial Restraint.&nbsp;</b>Pretrial restraint may only be ordered if there is
a reasonable belief that the person committed an offense triable by
court-martial and the circumstances require restraint. Factors to consider in
ordering pretrial restraint include whether one can foresee that the person
will not appear at trial or will engage in serious criminal misconduct while
awaiting court-martial. Pretrial restraint should not be more rigorous than the
circumstances require.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.2.&nbsp;<b>Search and Seizure:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.16.2.1. The fourth
amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and
seizures. The authorization to search must be based on probable cause and
particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be
seized.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.2.2. Probable cause
to search exists when there is a reasonable belief that the person, property,
or evidence sought is located in the place or on the person to be searched.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.2.3.  Authorization
to search  is the military equivalent of a civilian search warrant. A search
authorization is an express permission, written or oral, issued by a competent
military authority to search a person or an area for specified property or
evidence or to search for a specific person and to seize such property,
evidence, or person.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.2.4. Commanders, as
well as military judges, installation commanders, and magistrates, are
authorized to direct inspections of persons and property under your command and
to authorize probable cause searches and seizures over anyone subject to
military law or at any place on the installation. However, a commander who
authorizes a search or seizure must be neutral and detached from the case and
facts. Therefore, the command functions of gathering facts and maintaining overall
military discipline must remain separate from the legal decision to grant
search authorization.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.2.5. The
installation commander has discretion to appoint, in writing, up to two
military magistrates who may also authorize search and seizure (including
apprehension) requests. Each magistrate must receive training provided by the
staff judge advocate on search and seizure issues.</span></p>

<p><span>7.16.3.&nbsp;<b>Inspections.</b>&nbsp;An
inspection is of a person, property or premises for the primary purpose of
determining and ensuring the security, military fitness, or good order and
discipline of a unit, organization or installation. Commanders may conduct
inspections of their units. Inspections are not searches. The distinction
between a search and an inspection is that an inspection is not conducted for
the primary purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial or other
disciplinary proceedings and does not focus on a particular suspect or
individual. Contraband seized during an inspection (for example, vehicle entry
checks, and random drug testing) is admissible in court.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.17.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Nonjudicial Punishment Article 15.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Nonjudicial punishment
is authorized under Article 15, UCMJ. Often referred to as an  Article 15, 
nonjudicial punishment provides commanders with an essential and prompt means
of maintaining good order and discipline without the stigma of a court-martial
conviction. An Article 15 may be imposed for minor offenses. Any Air Force
member can be punished by Article 15. Commanders are encouraged to take
nonpunitive disciplinary actions, such as counseling and administrative
reprimand, before resorting to Article 15. However, such measures are not
required before an Article 15 can be offered. An Article 15 should not be
offered unless the commander is prepared to proceed with court-martial charges
because an Article 15 cannot be imposed upon a member who demands trial by
court-martial.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.1.&nbsp;<b>Minor
Offense.&nbsp;</b>Whether an offense is minor depends on several factors and is
a matter left to the imposing commander's discretion. Besides the nature of the
offense, the commander should also consider the offender's age, grade, duty
assignments, record, experience, and the maximum sentence imposable for the
offense if tried by a general court-martial. Ordinarily, a minor offense is an
offense in which the maximum sentence imposable would not include a
dishonorable discharge or confinement for more than 1 year if tried by a
general court-martial.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.2.&nbsp;<b>Punishments Under Article 15.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The type and permissible
extent of punishment are limited by both the imposing commander's grade and the
offender's grade as reflected in Table 7.2. Punishments may include reduction
in grade, forfeiture of pay, restrictions, extra duties, and/or correctional
custody.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.<b>&nbsp;Procedures:&nbsp;</b>7.17.3.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>While
no specific standard of proof is applicable to nonjudicial punishment
proceedings, commanders should recognize that a member is entitled to demand
trial by court-martial, where proof beyond a reasonable doubt by competent
evidence is required for conviction. Commanders should consider whether such
proof is available before initiating action under Article 15. If not,
nonjudicial punishment is usually not warranted. Commanders must confer with
the staff judge advocate, or a designee, before initiating nonjudicial
punishment proceedings and before imposing punishment. The staff judge advocate
advises and helps the commander evaluate the facts and determine what offense
was committed. However, the commander makes the decision to impose punishment
and the degree of punishment imposed. The military justice section of the base
legal office prepares the Air Force IMT 3070,&nbsp;<i>Record of Nonjudicial
Punishment Proceedings</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>After
the commander determines that nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, the staff
judge advocate prepares an Air Force Form 3070A,&nbsp;<i>Record of Nonjudicial
Punishment Proceedings (AB thru SSgt)</i><b>;&nbsp;</b>Air Force Form 3070B,<b>&nbsp;</b><i>Record
of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings (TSgt thru CMSgt)</i>;<b>&nbsp;</b>or Air
Force Form 3070C,<b>&nbsp;</b><i>Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings
(Officer)</i>. The commander notifies the member that he or she is considering
punishment under Article 15 by signing the Air Force Form 3070A/B/C and
providing it to the member. The Air Force Form 3070A/B/C includes a statement
of the alleged offenses, the member's rights, and the maximum punishment
allowable. After receiving the Air Force Form 3070A/B/C, the member has a right
to examine all statements and evidence available to the commander. In practice,
the member or the area defense counsel is provided copies of the evidence used
to support the alleged offenses.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Once
offered nonjudicial punishment, a member must first decide whether to accept.
The member has 3 duty days (72 hours) to make the decision. Before making the
decision, the member may consult with area defense counsel. A member's decision
to accept the Article 15 is not an admission of guilt but is a choice of forum.
The member may present matters orally, in writing, or both and may present
witnesses. The member is not required to present any matters or make any
statement and has the right to remain silent under Article 31(b), UCMJ.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.4. After
carefully considering all matters submitted by the member and consulting with
the staff judge advocate, the commander will indicate one of the following
decisions and annotate the Air Force Form 3070A/B/C accordingly:</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.4.1. The member
did not commit the offenses alleged, or nonjudicial punishment is not appropriate,
and the proceedings are terminated. In light of matters in extenuation and
mitigation, nonjudicial punishment is not appropriate, and the proceedings are
terminated.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.4.2. The member
committed one or more of the offenses alleged. (The commander must line out and
initial any offenses he or she determines were not committed.)</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.4.3. The member
committed one or more lesser-included offenses rather than the offenses listed.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.5. If the
commander finds the member committed an offense, he or she will determine the
appropriate punishment and serve it on the member, notifying the member of the
right to appeal.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.3.6. Members are
entitled to appeal nonjudicial punishment to the next superior authority in the
commander's chain of command. The member may appeal when he or she considers
the punishment to be unjust or disproportionate to the offense. A member may
assert the punishment was unjust because the offense was not committed. Thus,
the guilty finding, the punishment, or both may be appealed. The member has 5
calendar days to submit a written appeal an oral statement is not acceptable.
Punishments are not stayed during the appeal process.</span></p>

<p><span>However, if the
commander and/ or appellate authority fail to take action on an appeal within
five days after submission, and if the member so requests, any unexecuted
punishment involving restraint or extra duties will be delayed until after
appeal. The appellate authority may deny all relief, grant partial relief, or
grant all relief requested by the member. The appellate authority's decision is
final.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.4.&nbsp;<b>Suspension, Remission,
Mitigation, and Set-Aside Actions.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A commander has the
power to suspend, remit, or mitigate punishment of an Article 15.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Suspension.&nbsp;</b>To
suspend punishment is to postpone application of all or part for a specific
probationary period with the understanding that the punishment will be
automatically remitted (cancelled) at the end of this period if the member does
not engage in further misconduct. The probationary period may not exceed 6
months. Suspension may occur when the commander imposes the punishment or
within 4 months of executing the punishment. The Manual for Courts-Martial and
Air Force policy encourage the use of suspended sentences as a corrective tool
for first-time offenders to provide both an observation period and an incentive
for good behavior.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Remission.&nbsp;</b>Remission
is an action whereby any portion of the unexecuted punishment is cancelled,
normally used as a reward for good behavior or when determined the punishment
imposed was too severe for the particular offense.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Mitigation.&nbsp;</b>Mitigation
is a reduction in either the quantity or quality of a punishment. Commanders
may, at any time, mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the
punishment by changing to a less severe form or reduce the quantity. For
example, a reduction in grade can be mitigated to a forfeiture of pay.</span></p>

<p><span>7.17.4.4.&nbsp;<b>Set
Aside.&nbsp;</b>Setting aside is an action whereby the punishment, whether
executed or unexecuted, is set aside and any property, privilege, or rights
affected by the portion of the punishment set aside are restored. Commanders
use this action only when they believe that under all the circumstances of the
case the punishment has resulted in clear injustice.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.18. Types of Courts-Martial:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.18.1.<b>&nbsp;Summary Court-Martial.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A Summary Court-Martial
tries minor offenses. Instead of a military judge, an Regular Air Force
commissioned officer is appointed as the Summary Court-Martial officer. The
accused may have assistance from the area defense counsel. The Summary
Court-Martial considers the evidence, including witness testimony, and then
makes a finding. If the finding is guilty, the Summary Court-Martial considers
any additional evidence before deciding an appropriate sentence. Only enlisted
service members may be tried by Summary Court-Martial and only if they consent
to being tried in that forum. Sentences are limited as set out in Table 7.3,
Line 1, Column F.</span></p>

<p><span>7.18.2.&nbsp;<b>Special Court-Martial.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Any service member may be
tried by a Special Court-Martial. A Special Court-Martial is the
intermediate-level court in the military system. The Special Court-Martial
usually consists of a military judge and a panel (similar to a civilian jury)
of three or more members. Enlisted accused may request at least one-third of
the panel consist of enlisted members. The accused may request trial by
military judge alone. The proceedings include a trial counsel (prosecutor),
defense counsel, the accused, and a court reporter to record the proceedings. A
sentence in a Special Court-Martial may include any punishment authorized by
the Uniform Code of Military Justice except death, dishonorable discharge,
dismissal (in the case of an officer), or confinement in excess of 1 year.</span></p>

<p><span>7.18.3.&nbsp;<b>General Court-Martial.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A General Court-Martial
tries the most serious offenses. Cases cannot be referred for trial by General
Court-Martial without a preliminary hearing under Article 32, Uniform of
Military Justice. The General Court-Martial is composed of a military judge and
at least a five-member panel, and may include at least one-third enlisted
members, if so requested by an enlisted accused. The accused may request trial
by a military judge alone, except in a capital case (when a sentence to death
may be adjudged). The maximum authorized punishment this court-martial may
impose is the maximum allowable under the UCMJ for the offenses charged. For
some offenses, the maximum allowable sentence may include death.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.19. Court-Martial Procedures:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.19.1.&nbsp;<b>Trial.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When a case is referred
to trial, the convening authority, generally the wing or numbered Air Force
commander selects the court-martial panel. Panel members must be senior in
grade to the accused and be the best qualified. Throughout the court-martial
process, commanders and convening authorities are expressly forbidden to
exercise any improper influence on the action of the court.</span></p>

<p><span>7.19.2.&nbsp;<b>Findings and Sentence.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The verdict of a
court-martial is called the  findings.  An accused cannot be found guilty
unless guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A finding of guilty does not
require a unanimous agreement, but requires at least twothirds of the members
to vote for a finding of guilty. Voting is by secret written ballot. In the
event of a not-guilty verdict (acquittal), the trial ends. If there is a
finding of guilty, a pre-sentencing procedure follows immediately to help the
court determine an appropriate sentence. A sentence of death requires a
unanimous vote by a panel of twelve members, while a sentence of confinement in
excess of 10 years requires the concurrence of three-fourths of panel members.</span></p>

<p><span>7.19.3.&nbsp;<b>Post-Trial.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When the court reporter
completes the record of trial, the military judge ensures the record accurately
reflects the proceedings. Before the convening authority approves, disapproves,
or reduces all or part of the findings and sentence, the complete record must
be submitted to the staff judge advocate for review. When applicable, the staff
judge advocate will provide the convening authority a clear and concise written
recommendation. The accused and any victim named in a charge of which the
accused was convicted may provide matters for the convening authority s
consideration in making his or her clemency decision.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.20. Initial Review of Trial Records.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The convening authority
must act on every case. Pursuant to Article 60, UCMJ, the convening authority
has limited authority to disapprove the findings or sentence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.21. Appellate Review:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.21.1.&nbsp;<b>The Judge Advocate General.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Following the
court-martial, the record of the trial is reviewed for legal sufficiency. The
records of trail in each general court-martial is not otherwise reviewed under
Article 66 of the UCMJ shall be examined in the Office of The Judge Advocate
General if there is a finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or
withdraw his or her right to appellate review under Article 61.</span></p>

<p><span>7.21.2.&nbsp;<b>The U.S. Air Force Court of
Criminal Appeals.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force court of
criminal appeals is the first level of formal appellate review. The court may
approve, disapprove, or modify the convening authority's findings and sentence.
The court reviews records of trial that include a death sentence; dismissal of
a commissioned officer; a punitive discharge; or confinement of 1 year or more.</span></p>

<p><span>7.21.3.&nbsp;<b>The U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Armed Forces.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The United States court
of appeals for the Armed Forces is composed of five civilian judges appointed
by the President and is the highest appellate court in the military justice
system. The court reviews all cases in which the death sentence was imposed and
cases previously reviewed by the Air Force court of criminal appeals forwarded
on the judge advocate general's order. The accused may also petition to have
his or her case reviewed.</span></p>

<p><span>7.21.4.&nbsp;<b>The U.S. Supreme Court.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Decisions of the U.S.
court of appeals for the Armed Forces may be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme
Court.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.22. NCO Military Justice Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The military justice
system is one tool used to correct breaches of discipline. NCOs have a general
responsibility to be familiar with the UCMJ and correct marginal or substandard
behavior or duty performance of their subordinates. NCOs must:</span></p>

<p><span>7.22.1. Support their
commander in the application of the military justice system for maintaining
order and discipline.</span></p>

<p><span>7.22.2. Become involved
when breaches of discipline occur in their presence and report all such
violations to the proper authorities.</span></p>

<p><span>7.22.3. Be prepared to
investigate incidents when ordered to do so. This means that NCOs should be
familiar with both the right against self-incrimination and resources available
to assist in conducting the investigation and should not hesitate to seek
advice before acting.</span></p>

<p><span>7.22.4. Be familiar with
the rules in the UCMJ for apprehending, arresting, and confining violators of
the UCMJ.</span></p>

<p><span>7.22.5. Be prepared to
generally counsel Airmen on their legal rights under the UCMJ and refer them to
proper legal authorities for guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>7.22.6. Provide
leadership and counseling to obtain the maximum positive behavior change in the
member receiving Article 15 punishment.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 7F Legal Issues</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>7.23. Evolution of the Military Justice System:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.23.1. The strength of
the military depends on disciplined service members ready to fight and win our
Nation's wars. Military justice strengthens national security by providing
commanders with an efficient and effective means of maintaining good order and
discipline. Furthermore, the military justice system is a separate criminal
justice system that does not look to the civilian courts to dispose of
disciplinary problems. As a separate system, it allows the military to handle
unique military crimes that civilian courts would be unable to handle.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.2. In addition, a
separate system enables the military to address crimes committed by service
members at worldwide locations in times of war or peace. The military needs a
justice system that goes wherever the troops go to provide uniform treatment
regardless of locale or circumstances. No other judicial system in the U.S.
provides such expansive coverage. As our separate military justice system has
evolved, this system has balanced two basic interests: discipline (essential to
warfighting capability) and justice (a fair and impartial system essential to
the morale of those serving their country).</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.3. While military
justice can be traced to the time of the Roman armies, the historical
foundation for the U.S. military law and criminal justice system is the British
Articles of War. In fact, the first codes predated the U.S. Constitution and
Declaration of Independence. These codes were the Articles of War, applicable
to the Army, and the Articles for the Government of the Navy. Through World War
I, these codes went through some amendments and revisions but were
substantially unchanged for more than 100 years. Throughout most of this time,
the U.S. had a very small standing military. Those who entered the military
understood they were going to fall under a different system of justice with
unique procedures and punishments. While some people had bad experiences with
the military justice system during this time, there was no overwhelming demand
for change.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.4. This changed
with World War II when the U.S. had over 16 million men and women serving in
the U.S. Armed Forces. Incredibly, there were about 2 million courts-martial
during hostilities. There were approximately 80,000 general courts-martial
during World War II. An average of more than 60 general courts-martial
convictions occurred per day for the duration of the war.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.5. The soldiers and
sailors of World War II were regular citizens who volunteered or were drafted.
Many of these citizens had some very unpleasant experiences with the military
justice system, which looked quite different than today. The military justice
system did not offer members the protections afforded by the civilian court
system, and many American citizens disapproved of the way criminal laws were
being applied in the military. Following the war, many organizations studied
and made proposals to improve the military criminal legal system, and Congress
conducted hearings on the military justice system.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.6. After
unification of the Armed Services under the Department of Defense in 1947,
Secretary James V. Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defense, decided there
should not be separate criminal law rules for the different branches of
Service. He desired a uniform code that would apply to all services and address
the abuses from World War II. His efforts set the stage for a new uniform
system of discipline. In 1950, Congress enacted the UCMJ; this legislation is
contained in Title10, United States Code, Sections 801 through 946. The UCMJ is
the military's criminal code applicable to all branches of service.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.7. The UCMJ became
effective in 1951 and provided substantial procedural guarantees of an open and
fair process that continues today. The UCMJ required attorneys to represent the
accused and the Government in all general courtsmartial, prohibited improper
command influence, and created the appellate court system. Furthermore, the
UCMJ established Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard Boards of Review as the
first level of appeal in the military justice system and the U.S. Court of
Military Appeals as the second level of appeal. The Court of Military Appeals,
composed of five civilian judges, was perhaps the most revolutionary change
that brought the checks and balances of civilian control of the U.S. Armed
Forces into the military justice system. In October 1994, the Court of Military
Appeals was renamed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to bring the
name more in line with our civilian counterparts.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.8. In addition to
changing courts-martial processes and procedures, the UCMJ provided a complete
set of criminal laws. Moreover, the UCMJ included many crimes punished under
civilian law (for example, murder, rape, drug use, larceny, drunk driving,
etc.), and also punished other conduct that affects good order and discipline.
These unique military crimes include such offenses as desertion, absence
without leave, disrespect toward superiors, failure to obey orders, dereliction
of duty, wrongful disposition of military property, drunk on duty, malingering,
and conduct unbecoming an officer. The UCMJ also included provisions punishing
misbehavior before the enemy, improper use of countersign, misbehavior of a
sentinel, misconduct as a prisoner, aiding the enemy, spying, and espionage.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.9. The UCMJ has
been amended on a number of occasions. For example, the Military Justice Act of
1968 created the position of military judge, authorized trial by military judge
alone, required an attorney to act as defense counsel in all Special
Court-Martials when the authorized punishment included a bad conduct discharge,
prohibited trial by Summary Court-Martial if the accused objected, and changed
service boards of review to courts of review.</span></p>

<p><span>7.23.10. The next
significant change was the Military Justice Act of 1983, which streamlined
pretrial and post-trial procedures. The act also provided for direct appeals to
the U.S. Supreme Court from the Court of Military Appeals in appropriate cases,
without the need to first pursue an appeal through the civilian appellate
courts. The act also established a separate punitive article (112a) for drug
offenses. Today's UCMJ reflects centuries of experience in criminal law and
military justice and guarantees service members rights and privileges similar
to and, in many cases, greater than those enjoyed by civilians.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.24. Constitutional Underpinnings:</span></b></p>

<p><span>Two provisions in the
U.S. Constitution grant powers to the legislative and executive branches
providing the legal foundation for our military justice system.</span></p>

<p><span>7.24.1.<b>&nbsp;Powers Granted to
Congress.&nbsp;</b><i>&nbsp;</i></span></p>

<p><span>The
U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 8, provides that Congress is empowered to
declare war; raise and support armies; provide and maintain a navy; make rules
for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; provide for
calling forth the militia; and organize, arm, and discipline the militias, and
govern such part of them as may be employed in the service of the U.S..
Congress is also responsible for all laws deemed necessary and proper for
carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by the
U.S. Constitution in the U.S.</span></p>

<p><span>Government. Congress has
exercised their responsibilities over military justice by enacting the UCMJ.</span></p>

<p><span>7.24.2.&nbsp;<b>Authority Granted to the
President.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The U.S. Constitution,
Article II, Section 2, provides that the President serves as commander in chief
of the U.S. Armed Forces and of the militia of the states (National Guard) when
called to federal service. By virtue of authority as commander in chief, the
President has the power to issue executive orders to govern the U.S. Armed
Forces as long as these orders do not conflict with any basic constitutional or
statutory provisions. Article 36, UCMJ, specifically authorizes the President
to prescribe the procedures, including rules of evidence, to be followed in
courts-martial. In accordance with Article 36, UCMJ, President Harry S. Truman
established the Manual for CourtsMartial in 1951 to implement the UCMJ. The
Manual for Courts-Martial, like the UCMJ, has undergone a number of revisions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.25. Jurisdiction of Military Courts.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Courts-martial jurisdiction
is concerned with the question of personal jurisdiction (Is the accused a
person subject to the UCMJ?) and subject-matter jurisdiction (Is the conduct
prohibited by the UCMJ?). If the answer is  yes' in both instances, then (and
only then) does a court-martial have jurisdiction to decide the case.</span></p>

<p><span>7.25.1.<b>&nbsp;Personal Jurisdiction:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.25.1.1. Personal
jurisdiction involves status, that is, the accused must possess the legal
status of a service member or a person otherwise subject to the UCMJ before personal
jurisdiction can attach.</span></p>

<p><span>7.25.1.2. Article 2,
UCMJ, includes the following as persons subject to court-martial jurisdiction:
(1) members of a regular component of the Armed Forces; including those
awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms of enlistment; (2) cadets,
aviation cadets, and midshipmen; (3) members of a Reserve component while on
inactive duty training (but, in the case of members of the Army National Guard
and Air National Guard, only when in Federal service); (4) retired members of a
Regular component of the Armed Forces who are entitled to pay; (5) persons in
custody of the Armed Forces serving a sentence imposed by court-martial; (6)
prisoners of war in custody of the Armed Forces; and (7) in time of declared
war or a contingency operation, persons serving with or accompanying an armed
force in the field.</span></p>

<p><span>7.25.1.3. While the UCMJ
previously provided for jurisdiction over civilians serving with or
accompanying an armed force in the field in time of war, the U.S. court of
appeals for the Armed Forces held that the phrase  in time of war  meant a war
formally declared by Congress. The U.S. court of appeals for the Armed Forces
decided this issue in reviewing a case (<i>U.S. v. Averette</i>, 1970) in which
a civilian had been tried during the Vietnam Conflict for crimes committed
within the combat zone. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2007, Congress amended Article 2(a)(10) to provide for UCMJ jurisdiction
over civilians serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field in time
of declared war or a contingency operation.</span></p>

<p><span>7.25.2.<b>&nbsp;Subject-Matter
Jurisdiction:&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.25.2.1. Courts-martial
have the power to try any offense under the code except when prohibited from
doing so by the U.S. Constitution. Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction
when a purely military offense such as desertion, failure to obey orders, or
disrespect toward superiors is involved. However, if the offense violates both
the UCMJ and a civilian code, concurrent jurisdiction may exist. For example,
if an Regular Air Force military member is caught shoplifting at an off-base
merchant, the member can be tried by court-martial for larceny in violation of
Article 121, UCMJ, and tried by a civilian court for a larceny offense
recognized in the local jurisdiction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.25.2.2. The
determination as to whether a military or a civilian authority will try the
member is normally made through consultation or prior agreement between
appropriate military authorities (ordinarily the staff judge advocate) and appropriate
civilian authorities. A member to be tried by both a court-martial and a state
court for the same act is constitutionally permissible and a member who has
been tried by a state court normally will not be tried by court-martial for the
same act. Only the Secretary of the Air Force may approve such prosecutions,
and only in the most unusual cases, when the ends of justice and discipline can
be met in no other way.</span></p>



<p><b><span>7.26. Commander Involvement:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.26.1. Military
commanders are responsible for maintaining law and order in the communities
over which they have authority and for maintaining the discipline of the
fighting force. Reports of crimes may come from law enforcement or criminal
investigative agencies, as well as reports from supervisors or individual
service members. One of the commander's greatest powers in the administration
of military justice is the exercise of discretion to decide how misconduct
committed by a member of his or her command will be resolved. Each commander in
the chain of command has independent, yet overlapping, discretion to dispose of
offenses within the limits of that officer's authority. A commander may dispose
of the case by taking no action, initiating administrative action against the
member, offering the member nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, or
preferring court-martial charges. Ordinarily, the immediate commander
determines how to dispose of an offense; however, a superior commander may
withhold that authority. The staff judge advocate is available to provide
advice, but the commander ultimately decides how to dispose of alleged
misconduct.</span></p>

<p><span>7.26.2. If a commander
believes preferred charges should be disposed by court-martial, the charges are
forwarded to the convening authority. Convening authorities are superior
commanders or officials who possess the authority to convene specific levels of
courts-martial (wing and numbered Air Force commanders in most cases). A
convening authority convenes a court-martial by issuing an order that charges
previously preferred against an accused will be tried by a specified
court-martial. The convening authority must personally make the decision to
refer a case to trial; delegation of this authority is not allowed. Charges may
be referred to one of three types of court-martial: summary, special, or
general.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.27. Roles of the Parties in the Adversarial
System.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In courts-martial, both Government and the
accused have legal counsel. In addition, detailed defense counsel must include
judge advocates, graduates of an accredited law school, and members of the bar
of a federal court or the highest court of a state. Moreover, counsel must have
certification to perform duties by a service's judge advocate general. The
trial counsel prosecutes in the name of the U.S. and presents evidence against
the accused. The defense counsel represents the accused and zealously seeks to
protect the accused's rights.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.1.<b>&nbsp;Trial Counsel:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.27.1.1. Trial counsel
are similar to prosecutors in civilian criminal trials. They represent the
Government, and their objective is justice, not merely securing a conviction.
They zealously present evidence they believe is admissible and seek to persuade
the court that the accused committed the alleged offenses. Trial counsel argues
the inferences most strongly supporting the charges. Highly experienced trial
advocates (senior trial counsel) are available to assist in the prosecution of
particularly complex courts-martial.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.1.2. Trial counsel
also presents evidence and arguments to address defenses raised on behalf of
the accused. Trial counsel may not ethically permit the continuance of the
cause of action against the accused knowing the charges are not supported by
probable cause. Additionally, trial counsel have an affirmative duty to
disclose to the defense any evidence that negates the accused's guilt,
mitigates the degree of guilt, or reasonably tends to reduce the punishment of
the accused.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.1.3. No person who
has acted as accuser (one who prefers charges), preliminary hearing officer,
military judge, or court member in any case may act later as trial counsel or
assistant trial counsel in the same case. No person who has acted for the
prosecution may act later in the same case for the defense, nor may any person
who has acted for the defense act later in the same case for the prosecution.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.2.<b>&nbsp;Defense Counsel Representation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In a trial by
court-martial, the accused is entitled to an area defense counsel free of
charge. The accused may also hire a civilian lawyer at his or her own expense.
An accused may request representation by a particular military lawyer, and this
officer will serve if he or she is reasonably available. Defense counsel will
zealously, within the bounds of the law, guard the interests of the accused.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.3.<b>&nbsp;Military Judge.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A military trial judge
presides over each open session of the court-martial. Military trial judges are
selected from highly qualified, experienced judge advocates. Like defense
counsel, military judges are assigned to the Air Force Legal Operations Agency
and do not report to anyone at base level. No person is eligible to act as
military judge in a case if he or she was the accuser, is a witness for the
prosecution, or has acted as preliminary hearing officer or a counsel in the
same case. The military judge of a court-martial may not consult with the
members of the court except in the presence of the accused, trial counsel, and
defense counsel, nor does he or she vote with the members of the court. In
noncapital cases, an accused may elect to be tried by military judge alone. If
such an election is made, the military judge will make a finding of guilty or
not guilty and, if guilty, determine the sentence.</span></p>



<p><span>7.27.4.<b>&nbsp;Court Members:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.27.4.1. Members
detailed to a court-martial are those persons who, in the opinion of the
convening authority, are best qualified for the duty by reason of their age,
education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.4.2. Court panels
are normally only composed of officers senior to the accused. If the accused is
enlisted and makes a timely request that enlisted members be included on the
court, the panel must consist of at least one-third enlisted personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.4.3. Court members
determine whether the accused has been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
and, if guilty, adjudge (decide) a proper sentence based on the evidence and
according to the instructions of the military judge. No member may use grade or
position to influence another member. Voting is done by secret, written ballot.
7.27.5.&nbsp;<b>Ethical Standards.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Both trial and defense
counsels are bound by the ethical standards detailed in AFI 51-110,&nbsp;<i>Professional
Responsibility Program</i>. These standards cover a variety of matters. For
example, counsel may not:</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.1. Present
testimony known to be perjured or other evidence known to be false.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.2. Intentionally
misrepresent any piece of evidence or matter of law.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.3. Unnecessarily
delay or prolong the proceedings.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.4. Obstruct
communications between prospective witnesses and counsel for the other side.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.5. Use illegal
means or condone the use of illegal means to obtain evidence.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.6. Inject his or
her own personal opinions or beliefs into arguments to the court.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.7. Appeal to
passion or prejudice.</span></p>

<p><span>7.27.5.8. Attempt to
influence court members by currying favor or communicating privately with
them.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.28. Post-trial Matters and Appellate Review:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.28.1.&nbsp;<b>Post-trial Matters.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The convening authority
must act on every case. When taking action on a case, the convening authority
must consider the results of trial, written recommendation of the staff judge
advocate when required, and written matters submitted by the accused and any
victim named in a charge of which the accused was convicted. Convening
authorities may also consider the record of trial, personnel records of the
accused, and other matters they deem appropriate. Pursuant to Article 60, UCMJ,
the convening authority has limited authority to disapprove the findings or
sentence&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.1.1. The convening
authority may, but is not required to, grant clemency on the findings. If the
convening authority so chooses, some clemency on findings may be given, subject
to regulatory and statutory limitations. The convening authority must provide a
written explanation for such action.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.1.2. Regardless of
the offenses charged, the convening authority may not disapprove, commute, or
suspend in whole or in part an adjudged sentence of confinement for more than 6
months or a punitive discharge, unless exceptions apply.</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.2.<b>&nbsp;Appellate
Review.</b>&nbsp;Following the convening authority's action is appellate
review. The type of appellate review depends upon the adjudged and approved
sentence.</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.2.1. The judge
advocate general is the review authority in general court-martial cases where
the sentence does not include death, dismissal, punitive discharge, or
confinement for 1 year or more. The judge advocate general may also elect to
certify (refer) any case reviewed by The Judge Advocate General's office to the
Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is
an independent appellate judicial body authorized by Congress and established
by the judge advocate general pursuant to direction of Title 10, United States
Code, Section 866(a) (1994). The court hears and decides appeals of Air Force
court-martial convictions and appeals during litigation. The Air Force court of
criminal appeals appellate judges are judge advocates appointed by the judge
advocate general.</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.2.2. Unless
appellate review is waived by an appellant, the Air Force court of criminal
appeals automatically reviews all cases involving a sentence that includes
death, dismissal, a punitive discharge, or confinement of 1 year or more.
However, appellate review cannot be waived in death penalty cases. In this
forum, the appellant is provided a military counsel (free of charge) who is an
experienced trial advocate and a full-time appellate counsel. Civilian
appellate counsel may be retained at the appellant's own expense. The
Government is represented by appellate Government counsel.</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.2.3. The Air Force
court of criminal appeals must consist of a panel of at least three military
judges, reviews the case for legal error, and determines if the record of trial
supports both the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority.
The Air Force court of criminal appeals has the power to dismiss the case,
change a finding of guilty to one of not guilty or guilty to a lesser-included
offense, reduce the sentence, or order a rehearing. However, the appeal may not
change a finding of not guilty to one of guilty. The judge advocate general
instructs convening authorities to take action according to the court s
decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.2.4. If the Air
Force court of criminal appeals rules against the appellant, he or she may
request review by the U.S. court of appeals for the Armed Forces. The U.S.
court of appeals for the Armed Forces must review all death penalty cases and
any other case directed by The Judge Advocate General of each service. Review
in other cases is discretionary upon petition of the appellant and upon good
cause shown. Air Force appellate defense counsel are appointed to represent the
appellant before the U.S. court of appeals for the Armed Forces. If an
appellant's case is reviewed and relief is not granted by the U.S. court of
appeals for the Armed Forces, the appellant may petition the Supreme Court of
the U.S. for further review.</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.2.5. The Secretary
of the Air Force automatically reviews cases involving dismissal of an Air
Force officer or cadet. Dismissal is a punishment that punitively separates
officers from the service. The dismissal cannot be executed until the
Secretary, or appointed designee, approves the sentence.</span></p>

<p><span>7.28.2.6. If the
sentence extends to death, the individual cannot be put to death until the
President approves this part of the sentence. The President has clemency powers
over all courts-martial cases and may commute, remit, or suspend any portion of
the sentence. However, the President may not suspend the part of the sentence
that provides for death.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.29. Punitive Articles.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This paragraph focuses
on unique military offenses that do not have a counterpart in civilian law.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.&nbsp;<b>Absence Offenses.</b></span></p>

<p><span>For an armed force to be
effective, they must have sufficient members present to carry out the mission.
One way this can be accomplished is by deterring members from being absent
without authority, whether the absences are permanent or temporary. The
circumstances under which the absence occurs, as well as the intent of the accused,
determines the severity of the offense. Absence offenses include desertion and
being absent without official leave.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Desertion:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.1.1. Article 85,
UCMJ, may occur under the following categories: (1) unauthorized absence with
the intent to remain away permanently; (2) quitting the unit or place of duty
to avoid hazardous duty or shirk important service; or (3) desertion by an
officer before notice of acceptance of resignation. More severe punishment is
authorized if the desertion is terminated by apprehension instead of a
voluntary surrender or if the desertion occurs in wartime. Desertion may be
charged as a capital offense (which authorizes the death penalty) during
wartime.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.1.2. Absence with
the specific intent to remain away permanently is the most commonly charged
type of desertion. The unauthorized absence may be from the accused's place of
duty, unit, or organization. The specific intent to remain away permanently may
exist at the beginning of the absence or may be formed at any time during the
absence. Thus, when a member leaves without permission, intending to return
after a period of time, but later decides never to return, the member has
committed the offense of desertion. However, proving intent is often difficult
and may be shown by a number of factors, including the length of the absence,
use of an alias, disposal of military identification and clothing items,
concealment of military status, distance from duty station, and the assumption
of a permanent-type civilian status or employment. The accused's voluntary
return to military control is not a defense to desertion. The essential issue
is whether the accused, at any time, formed the intent to remain away
permanently.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Absent Without Official Leave:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.2.1. Article 86,
UCMJ, addresses other cases where the member is not at the place where he or
she is required to be at a prescribed time. This includes failure to go to the
appointed place of duty; going from the appointed place of duty; absence from
unit, organization, or other place of duty; abandoning watch or guard; and
absence with intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises.</span></p>

<p><span><br>
.1.2.2. Proving a failure to go to an appointed place of duty requires showing
the accused actually knew he or she was required to be at the appointed place
of duty at the prescribed time. The offense of going from the appointed place
of dutyrequires proof the accused left his or her place of duty without proper
authority, rather than failing to report in the first place. The accused must
have reported for and begun the duty before leaving without proper authority.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.2.3. Absence
from the unit, organization, or other place of duty<i>&nbsp;</i>is a common
absent without official leave charge. The authorized maximum punishment for
this offense varies with the duration of the absence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.2.4.
 Inability to return from leave  is a defense if the accused encountered
unforeseeable circumstances beyond his or her control. For example, if
Technical Sergeant Jane Doe's authorized 10-day period of leave expired on 1
December and she failed to report to her unit until 3 December, she would not
be guilty of absent without official leave if she could establish she was at a
distant city and had purchased an airline ticket on a flight that was cancelled
due to a blizzard. Even though she has a defense, she is not excused from
calling her unit and requesting an extension of leave. Inability would not be a
defense where a military member took space-available transportation to Europe
while on leave and then claimed he or she was unable to return on the date
planned because he or she was unable to get space-available transportation back
when he or she had hoped.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.1.2.5. Other
absences include abandoning watch or guard and absence from the unit,
organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid maneuvers or field
exercises. In addition, Article 87, UCMJ, provides that missing a movement is
an offense that applies when the member, through neglect or design, misses the
movement of a ship, aircraft, or unit.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.2.&nbsp;<b>False Official Statements.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Article
107, UCMJ, covers both the making and signing of false official statements and
official documents. An  official  statement or document is any statement or
document made in the line of duty.  In the line of duty  pertains to a matter
within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department or agency. Furthermore, you must
be able prove that the accused knew the statement or document was false and had
a specific intent to deceive. Examples include falsely identifying oneself to a
base gate guard or falsely listing a person as one's dependent to gain base
privileges.</span></p>

<p><span>However, material
gain is not an element of the offense.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.3.&nbsp;<b>General Article.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The General Article
(Article 134) is designed to address unspecified offenses punishable because of
their effect on the U.S. Armed Forces. Article 134 generally provides for those
offenses not specifically mentioned elsewhere in the punitive articles of the
UCMJ. A military member can be punished under Article 134 for any and all
disorders and neglects that are prejudicial to good order and discipline in the
Armed Forces, for conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces,
and for crimes and offenses not capital.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Disorders
and Neglects Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline.&nbsp;</b>Article 134,
UCMJ, seeks to protect the internal operation of the U.S. Armed Forces. The
issue is the effect of the accused's act on good order and discipline within
the Armed Forces. The effect must be reasonably direct and tangible. Disorders
and neglects prejudicial to good order and discipline include breach of customs
of the service, fraternization, impersonating an officer, disorderly conduct,
gambling with a subordinate, and incapacitating oneself for duty through prior
indulgence in intoxicating liquors.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Conduct
of a Nature To Bring Discredit upon the Armed Forces.&nbsp;</b>The concern here
is the potential effect of the accused's act on the reputation of the U.S.
Armed Forces (how the military is perceived by the civilian sector). The
conduct must tend to bring the Service into disrepute or lower it in public
esteem. Thus, violations of local civil law or foreign law may be punished if
they bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, such as dishonorable failure to pay
debts, indecent exposure, fleeing the scene of an accident, bigamy, adultery,
or pandering.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Crimes
and Offenses Not Capital.&nbsp;</b>Acts or omissions not chargeable under other
articles of the UCMJ, but are crimes or offenses under federal statutes, are
charged under Article 134; for example, counterfeiting. This crime is not
specifically listed in the UCMJ but is still a violation of federal law. Also,
if a military member commits an act in an area over which the military
exercises exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction with the state and no UCMJ
article or federal law prohibits the act only the law of the state prohibits
the act then the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act allows the member to be tried
by a court-martial under Article 134.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.4.&nbsp;<b>Offenses Related to War.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The UCMJ includes a
number of offenses related to war. These offenses include misbehaving before
the enemy, aiding the enemy, compelling surrender, improperly using
countersigns, mishandling captured or abandoned property, committing misconduct
as a prisoner of war, and making disloyal statements. Two especially egregious
offenses related to war are misbehavior before the enemy and misconduct as a
prisoner of war.</span></p>

<p><span>.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Misbehavior
Before the Enemy.&nbsp;</b>Article 99, UCMJ, provides that running away before
the enemy and cowardly conduct are capital offenses punishable by death.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.4.1.1. The
term  enemy  (as used in  running away before the enemy ) includes both
civilian and military organized forces of the enemy in time of war and any
opposing hostile bodies including rebellious mobs or bands of renegades. The
term is not restricted to the enemy Government or their Armed Forces. If the misbehavior
were caused by fear, the offense is charged as  cowardly conduct,  rather than
 running away.  Whether a person is  before the enemy  is not a question of
definite distance, but one of tactical relation.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.4.1.2. The
critical element in the offense of cowardly conduct is fear that results in the
abandonment or refusal to perform one's duty. Fear is a natural apprehension
going into battle, and the mere display of apprehension does not constitute
this offense. Cowardice is misbehavior motivated by fear. Genuine or extreme
illness or other disability at the time of the alleged misbehavior may be a
defense.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Misconduct
as a Prisoner of War.&nbsp;</b>Article 105, UCMJ, recognizes two types of
offenses arising in prisoner of war situations. One offense involves
unauthorized conduct by an accused who secures favorable treatment to the
detriment of other prisoners. The other offense prohibits maltreatment of a
prisoner of war by a person in a position of authority. The purpose of this
article is to protect all persons held as prisoners, whether military or
civilian and regardless of their nationality.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.5.<b>&nbsp;Insubordination:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.29.5.1.
Insubordinate conduct may be expressed in many different ways and toward many
different persons in the military community. Insubordination is judged both by
the means used and the relative relationship in the military hierarchy of the
parties involved.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.5.2. Article
89, UCMJ, prohibits disrespectful acts or language used toward a superior
commissioned officer in his or her capacity as an officer or as a private
individual. Therefore, the superior commissioned officer does not need to be in
the execution of his or her office at the time of the disrespectful behavior.
However, it must be established that the accused knew the person against whom
the acts or words were directed was the accused's superior commissioned
officer. Disrespect may include neglecting the customary salute or showing a
marked disdain, indifference, insolence, impertinence, undue familiarity, or
other rudeness toward the superior officer. Truth is no defense. A superior
commissioned officer is one who is superior in rank or command.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.5.3. Article
91, UCMJ, similarly prohibits insubordinate conduct toward a warrant officer,
NCO, or petty officer. However, unlike Article 89 violations, the insubordinate
conduct must occur while the individual being disrespected is in the execution
of his or her duties. In addition, Article 91 does not require a
superior-subordinate relationship as an element of the prescribed offense and
can only be committed by enlisted members.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.5.4. Another
form of insubordination involves striking or assaulting a superior officer.
Article 90(1), UCMJ, prohibits assaults and batteries against superior
commissioned officers in the execution of their duties. Article 91 prohibits
similar conduct toward warrant officers, NCOs, and petty officers.  In the
execution of his office  includes any act or service the officer is required or
authorized to do by statute, regulation, orders, or customs. An essential
element is the accused's knowledge that the person is a superior officer or
superior warrant officer, NCO, or petty officer. In time of war, striking a
superior commissioned officer can be a capital offense.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.6.<b>&nbsp;Disobedience Offenses:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.29.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Disobeying
a Superior Officer.&nbsp;</b>Article 90(2), UCMJ, prohibits the intentional or
willful disobedience of the lawful orders of a superior officer.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Failure
to Obey Orders or Regulations.&nbsp;</b>Article 92, UCMJ, provides that members
are subject to courtmartial if they: (1) violate or fail to obey any lawful
general order or regulation; (2) having knowledge of a lawful order issued by a
member of the Armed Forces, which is their duty to obey, fail to obey the
order; or (3) are derelict in the performance of their duties.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.6.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Lawful
General Order or Regulation.&nbsp;</b>This term relates to general orders or
regulations that are properly published by the President, the Secretary of
Defense, the Secretary of a military department, an officer having General
Court-Martial jurisdiction, a general officer in command, or a commander
superior to one of the former. (A squadron commander does not have the
authority to issue general orders.) Once issued, a general order or regulation
remains in effect even if a subsequent commander assumes command. Knowledge of
the order is not an element of the offense, and a lack of knowledge is not a
defense. Only those general orders or regulations that are  punitive  are
enforceable under Article 92(1). A punitive order or regulation specifically
states a member may be punished under the UCMJ if violated. Regulations that
only supply general guidelines or advice for conducting military functions are
not  punitive  and cannot be enforced under Article 92(1).</span></p>

<p><span>.6.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Other
Lawful Orders or Regulations.&nbsp;</b>This offense includes violations of
written regulations that are not general regulations. The key requirements are
that the accused had a duty to obey the order and had actual knowledge of the
order. Such knowledge is usually proven through circumstantial evidence. The
accused cannot be convicted of this offense merely because he or she should
have known about the order. Failure to obey a wing-level directive that
prohibits overnight guests in the dormitory is an example.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.6.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Dereliction
of Duty.&nbsp;</b>Dereliction of duty is comprised of three elements: (1) the
accused had certain duties; (2) the accused knew or reasonably should have
known of the duties; and (3) the accused was derelict in performing the duties,
either by willfully failing to carry them out or by carrying them out in a
negligent or culpably inefficient manner.  Willfully  means performing an act
knowingly and purposely while specifically intending the natural and probable
consequences of the act.  Negligently  means an act or omission of a person who
is under a duty to use due care that exhibits a lack of this degree of care
that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar
circumstances.  Culpable inefficiency  means an inefficiency for which there is
no reasonable or just excuse. Merely being inept in the performance of duty
will not support a charge of dereliction of duty, that is, officers or enlisted
members cannot be punished for inadequate performance if they make a good faith
effort but fall short because of a lack of aptitude or ability. Such
performance may be grounds for administrative demotion or administrative
discharge, but is not a crime.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.7.<b>&nbsp;Lawfulness of Orders:</b></span></p>

<p><span>7.29.7.1. A lawful
order must be: (1) reasonably in furtherance of or connected to military needs;
(2) specific as to time and place and definite and certain in describing the
thing or act to be done or omitted; and (3) not otherwise contrary to
established law or regulation.</span></p>

<p><span>7.29.7.2. An order
is in furtherance of, or connected to, military needs when it involves
activities reasonably necessary to accomplish a military mission or to
safeguard or promote the morale, discipline, and usefulness of command. Such an
order may interfere with private rights or personal affairs, provided a valid
military purpose exists. Furthermore, the dictates of a person's conscience,
religion, or personal philosophy cannot justify or excuse disobedience of an
otherwise lawful order. An order requiring the performance of a military duty
or act may be inferred to be lawful and is disobeyed at the peril of the
subordinate. This inference does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as
one that directs the commission of a crime. An accused cannot be punished for disobeying
or failing to obey an unlawful order.</span></p>

<p><b><span>7.30. Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>7.30.1. Air Force
commanders must continuously evaluate force readiness and organizational
efficiency and effectiveness. The inspection system provides the commander with
a credible, independent assessment process to measure the capability of
assigned forces. Inspectors benchmark best practices and exchange lessons
learned and innovative methods.</span></p>

<p><span>7.30.2. Criminal
activity and intelligence operations against the Air Force threaten national
security. When Air Force personnel commit criminal offenses, illegal activity
occurs on an Air Force installation, or Air Force security is breached or
compromised, the Air Force must thoroughly investigate criminal allegations and
intelligence threats and refer them to appropriate authorities for
action.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>7.30.3. The mission
of the U.S. Air Force is to defend the U.S. and protect its interests through
air, space and cyberspace. Many aspects of carrying out this job involve legal
issues. This chapter provided information on the Air Force Inspection System,
the Inspector General Complaints Program, individual standards, and punitive
actions. All four areas are necessary to enable the Air Force to fulfill our
national security obligations efficiently and effectively.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 8A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>8.1.<i>&nbsp;</i>Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military customs and
courtesies are proven traditions that explain what should and should not be
done in many situations. They are acts of respect and courtesy when dealing
with other people, and have evolved as a result of the need for order, as well
as the mutual respect and sense of fraternity that exists among military
personnel. Military customs and courtesies go beyond basic politeness; they
play an extremely important role in building morale, esprit de corps,
discipline, and mission effectiveness. Customs and courtesies ensure proper
respect for the military members and build the foundation for self-discipline.
Customs and courtesies are outlined in four sections: Symbols, Professional
Behavior, Drill and Ceremony, and Honor Guard. Not all-inclusive, this chapter
highlights many of the customs and courtesies that make the Air Force and its

<p><b><span>8.2. The United States (U.S.) Flag.</span></b></p>

<p><i><span>The flag of the U.S. has not been created by rhetorical sentences
in declarations of independence and in bills of rights. It has been created by
the experience of a great people, and nothing is written upon it that has not
been written by their life. It is the embodiment, not of a sentiment, but of a
history.</span></i></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;President
Woodrow Wilson</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Laws of the U.S. Flag.</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Position and Manner of Display.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The following rules will
be observed:</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.1. When carried in
a procession with another flag or flags, the flag of the U.S. should be either
on the marching right; that is, to the flag's own right (to the far right of
all others) (Figure 8.1), or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of
the center line. This also applies when flags are displayed in a stationary
position. Flags carried by Airmen are never at half-staff.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.2. The U.S. flag,
when displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be
on the right, the flag's own right (observer's left), and the staff should be
in front of the staff of the other flag (Figure 8.2).</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3. When the U.S.
flag is displayed from a flagstaff with other flags, the following applies:</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.1. When a number
of flags are grouped and displayed from staffs radiating from a central point,
and no foreign flags are in the display, the U.S. flag will be in the center
and at the highest point of the group as shown in Figure 8.3.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.2. When a number
of flags are displayed from staffs set in a line, all staffs will be of the
same height and same finial. The U.S. flag will be at the right, which is to
the left of an observer facing the display (Figure 8.4). However, if no foreign
national flags are involved in the display, the U.S. flag may be placed at the
center of the line when displayed at a higher level than the other flags in the
display (Figure 8.5).</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.3. When flags of
two or more nations are displayed, they are flown from separate staffs of the
same height. The flags should be of equal size. International usage prescribes
the display of the flag of one nation equal to that of another nation in time
of peace. The flags are displayed in a line, alphabetically, using the English
alphabet, with the U.S. flag at its own right (the observer's left). When in
North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, North Atlantic Treaty
Organization member country flags are displayed in French alphabetical order.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.4. When the U.S.
flag is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or at an angle from the
windowsill, balcony, or front of a building, the union (or blue field) of the
flag should be placed at the peak of the staff (Figure 8.6).</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.5. When displayed
either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost
and to the flag's own right; that is, to the observer's left (Figure 8.7). When
displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the
union to the left of observer in the street (Figure 8.8).</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.6. When the flag
is displayed over the<b>&nbsp;</b>middle of the street, the flag should be
suspended vertically with the union to the north on an east and west street or
to the east on a north and south street.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.7.
When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be
displayed above and behind the speaker (Figure 8.9). When displayed from a
staff in a church or public auditorium, the U.S. flag should hold the position
of superior prominence and in the position of honor at the clergyman's or
speaker's right as he or she faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed
should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the
audience (Figure 8.10).</span></p>

<p><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.8. When the
flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main
entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to
the observer's left upon entering. If the building has more than one main
entrance, the flag should be suspended vertically near the center of the
corridor or lobby with the union to the north when entrances are to the east
and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and south. If there are
entrances in more than two directions, the union should be to the east. This
includes aircraft hangars.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.9. When three
flag staffs are positioned outside a building, there may be two display
options. If the flag staffs are in a straight line, then the flags should be of
the same height with the U.S. flag to its own right. Use the building looking
out to the flags as the point of reference for flag placement when flags are in
line. If the flag is positioned on the center staff, then the center staff must
be higher than the other two staffs.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.10. On a
closed casket, place the flag lengthwise with the union at the head and over
the left shoulder of the deceased (Figure 8.11). When a full-couch casket is
opened, remove the flag, fold to the triangular shape of a cocked hat, and
place in the lid at the head end of the casket and just above the decedent s
left shoulder. When a half-couch casket is opened, fold the flag on the lower
half of the casket in the same relative position as when displayed full length
on a closed casket. Do not lower the flag into the grave, and do not allow the
flag to touch the ground. The interment flag may be given to the next of kin at
the conclusion of the interment.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.11.
Drape the flag left to right when posted and also when used in official
photographs. The blue field is on top with stripes running left to right.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>8.2.4.3.12. When painted or displayed on an
aircraft or vehicle, the union is toward the front and the stripes trail.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.<b>&nbsp;Respect for the U.S. Flag.</b></span></p>

<p><span>No disrespect should
be shown to the U.S. flag; the flag will not be dipped to any person or thing.
Regimental colors, state flags, and organizational or institutional flags are
always dipped as a mark of respect to the U.S. flag. However, the Air Force
flag and organizational flags will be dipped as appropriate. Military members
will render the military salute as appropriate. At no time will a foreign
national flag be dipped.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.1. The flag should never be displayed
with union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme
danger to life or property.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.2. The flag should never touch
anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise. The
flag should never be used as the covering for a statue or monument, although
the flag could form a distinctive feature in a ceremony of the unveiling of a
statue or monument.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.3. The flag should never be carried
flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.4. The flag should never be used as
wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. The flag should never be festooned, drawn
back, up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall free (for example, the flag
should not be used to cover a speaker's podium, drape the front of a platform,
or for other decoration. A proper substitute is bunting of blue, white, and
red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red
below).</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.5. The flag should never be fastened,
displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit the flag to be easily
torn, soiled, or damaged.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.6. The flag should never be used as a
covering for a ceiling.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.7. The flag should never have placed
upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter,
word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.8. The flag should never be used as a
receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.9. The flag should never be used for
advertising purposes or be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs.
Moreover, the flag should not be printed or otherwise impressed on paper
napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.
Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the
flag is flown.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.10. No part of the flag should be
used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to
the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic
organizations. A lapel flag pin, being a replica of the flag, should be worn on
the left lapel near the heart. Patches worn on uniforms depicting the U.S. flag
should be worn on the left shoulder, with the union to the viewer's left.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.11. The flag should not be displayed
on a float in a parade except from a staff.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.12. The flag should not be draped
over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle, railroad train, or boat. When
the flag is displayed on an automobile, the staff should be fixed firmly to the
chassis or clamped to the right fender.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.5.13. No other flag or pennant should
be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right (observer's left) of the
U.S. flag, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea
when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for
the personnel of the Navy.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.&nbsp;<b>Display of the U.S. Flag at Half-staff.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The U.S. flag is

<p><span>8.2.6.1. The following days apply:</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.1.1. On Memorial Day, fly the flag at
half-staff until noon, then raise to the top of the staff.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.1.2. On Peace Officers Memorial Day,
15 May, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.1.3. On Patriot Day, 11 September.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.1.4. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance
Day, 7 December.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.1.5. Each year in honor of the
National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service according to Public Law<span>&nbsp;</span>107-51.
This date is usually the first Sunday in October and is announced annually by
Presidential Proclamation.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.1.6. On the death of individuals in
accordance with AFI 34-1201.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.1.7. When so directed by the
President of the U.S. or the Secretary of Defense.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.2. The responsible military commander
ensures the procedures for flying the flag at half-staff are executed as
follows:</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.2.1. The term  half-staff  means the
position of the flag when the flag is one-half the distance between the top and
bottom of the staff.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.2.2. When flown at half-staff, first
hoist the flag to the peak for an instant and then lower to the half-staff
position. Raise the flag again to the peak position before lowering the flag
for the end of the day.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.3. The flag is flown at half-staff
outside the U.S. on Department of Defense buildings, grounds, and naval vessels
even if another nation's flag is flown full staff next to the U.S. flag.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.4. All flags displayed with the U.S.
flag are flown at half-staff when the U.S. flag is flown at half-staff, with
the exception of foreign national flags, unless the foreign country has granted
permission for their flag to also be at half-staff.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.6.5. The Heads of Department of Defense
components may direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on buildings,
grounds, or naval vessels under their jurisdiction on occasions when they
consider the flag be flown at half-staff proper and appropriate. Within the Air
Force, this authority is delegated to the installation commander. Any time an
installation commander decides to fly the flag at half-staff based on this
local authority for a local death, state the reason on the base marquees to
avoid confusion.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.7.<b>&nbsp;Care and Disposition of U.S. Flags.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Exercise extreme care to ensure proper
handling and cleaning of soiled flags. Professionally mend a torn flag, but
destroy a badly torn or tattered flag. Title 4, U.S. Code, Chapter 1, states:
"The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting
emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by
burning." There may be instances when a flag is retired from service and
preserved because of its historical significance. In this case, the unit must
request disposition instructions from the proper authority, such as the
installation honor guard or protocol office.</span></p>

<p><span>8.2.8.&nbsp;<b>How to Obtain a Flag Flown Over the Capitol.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Constituents may arrange to purchase flags
flown over the Capitol by getting in touch with their Senator or
Representative. A certificate signed by the Architect of the Capitol
accompanies each flag. Ordering procedures are outlined at the following web
site:&nbsp;</span><a href="file://rndap01302/PD/2017%20Handbook/06%20Final%20TOC,%20Final%20Chapters%20&amp;%20Attachments/Chapter%208%20MILITARY%20CUSTOMS,%20COURTESIES,%20AND%20PROTOCOL%20FOR%20SPECIAL%20EVENTS/www.aoc.gov/flags"><span>www.aoc.gov/flags</span></a><a href="file://rndap01302/PD/2017%20Handbook/06%20Final%20TOC,%20Final%20Chapters%20&amp;%20Attachments/Chapter%208%20MILITARY%20CUSTOMS,%20COURTESIES,%20AND%20PROTOCOL%20FOR%20SPECIAL%20EVENTS/www.aoc.gov/flags"><span><span>.</span></span></a></p>

and cloud form. The American bald eagle symbolizes the U.S. air power, and
appears in natural colors. The wreath under the eagle is made up of six
alternate folds of metal (white, representing silver) and light blue. This
repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the
eagle denote the start of a new sky.</span></p>

<p><span>8.3.1.2. The shield, directly below the
eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into two parts by a nebular line
representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with
flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of aerospace.
The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three
natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight
lightning bolts. The background of the top part is light blue representing the
sky. The lower part is white representing metal silver.</span></p>

<p><span>8.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Authorized and Unauthorized Uses of the Seal and
Coat of Arms.<span>&nbsp;</span></b></span></p>

<p><span>Title 18, United States Code, Section
506,&nbsp;<i>Seals of Departments or Agencies</i>, protects the Air Force seal
from unauthorized use. Falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or
altering the seal or knowingly using or possessing with fraudulent intent any
such altered seal is punishable by law. AFMAN 33-326,&nbsp;<i>Preparing
Official Communications,&nbsp;</i>Attachment 2, outlines the authorized users
and uses of the seal or any part thereof. The Coat of Arms is authorized for
unofficial use when approved by the Secretary of the Air Force of Public
Affairs (SAF/PA). This approving authority was delegated to the Air Force
Public Affairs Agency (AFPAA), a Field Operating Agency of SAF/PA.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.4. Official Air Force Symbol:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.4.1. The Air Force Symbol (Figure 8.15) was designated the
official symbol of the U.S. Air Force on 5 May 2004<b>.</b>&nbsp;The Symbol
honors the heritage of our past and represents the promise of our future.
Furthermore, the symbol retains the core elements of our Air Corps heritage the
 Arnold  wings and star with circle and modernizes them to reflect our air and
space force of today and tomorrow.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 8.15. Air Force Symbol</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.4.2. The Symbol has two main parts. In
the upper half, the stylized wings represent the stripes of our strength our
enlisted men and women. The wings are drawn with great angularity to emphasize
our swiftness and power and are divided into six sections which represent our
distinctive capabilities air and space superiority, global attack, rapid global
mobility, precision engagement, information superiority, and agile combat
support.</span></p>

<p><span>8.4.3. In the lower half
are a sphere, a star, and three diamonds. The sphere within the star represents
the globe. Moreover, the symbol reminds us of our obligation to secure our
Nation's freedom with global vigilance, reach, and power. The globe also reminds
us of our challenge as an expeditionary force to respond rapidly to crises and
to provide decisive air and space power worldwide.</span></p>

<p><span>8.4.4. The area
surrounding the sphere takes the shape of a star. The star has many meanings.
The five points represent the components of our one force and family our
Regular Air Force, civilians, Guard, Reserve, and retirees. The star symbolizes
space as the high ground of our nation's air and space force. The rallying
symbol in all our wars, the star also represents our officer corps, central to
our combat leadership.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>8.4.5. The star is
framed with three diamonds that represent our core values integrity first,
service before self, and excellence in all we do. The elements come together to
form one symbol that presents two powerful images at once an eagle, the emblem
of our Nation; and a medal, representing valor in service to our Nation.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 8C Professional
Behavior</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>8.5. Respect for the Flag.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The procedures to use
when showing respect to the flag and the national anthem include:</span></p>

<p><span>8.5.1.
When outdoors, all personnel in uniform, except those in formation must face
the flag and salute during the raising and lowering of the flag. Upon the first
note of the national anthem or  To the Colors,  all personnel in uniform who
are not in formation will stand at attention, face the flag (or the sound of
the music, if the flag is not visible), and salute. Hold the salute until the
last note of the national anthem or  To the Colors' is played.</span></p>

<p><span>8.5.2. All vehicles in
motion will pull to the side of the road and stop. All occupants sit quietly
until the last note of the national anthem or  To the Colors' has played.</span></p>

<p><span>8.5.3. When in civilian
clothes, face the flag (or the sound of the music if the flag is not visible)
and stand at attention with the right hand placed over the heart or render a
salute.</span></p>

<p><span>8.5.4. If indoors during
retreat or reveille, there is no need to stand or salute. However, everyone
must stand during the playing of the national anthem before a showing of a
movie while in the base theater. When listening to a radio or watching
television, no specific action is necessary. Additionally, a folded flag is
considered cased; therefore, a salute is not necessary.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.6. Saluting.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The salute is a
courteous exchange of greetings, with the junior member always saluting the
senior member first. A salute is also rendered to the flag as a sign of
respect. Any Airman, NCO, or officer recognizing a need to salute or a need to
return a salute may do so anywhere at any time. When returning or rendering an
individual salute, the head and eyes are turned toward the flag or person
saluted. Guidance when exchanging salutes includes:</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.<b>&nbsp;Outdoors.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Salutes are exchanged
upon recognition between officers or warrant officers and enlisted members of
the Armed Forces when they are in uniform. Saluting outdoors means salutes are
exchanged when the persons involved are outside of a building. For example, if
a person is on a porch, a covered sidewalk, a bus stop, a covered or open
entryway, or a reviewing stand, the salute will be exchanged with a person on
the sidewalk outside of the structure or with a person approaching or in the
same structure. This applies both on and off military installations. The junior
member should initiate the salute in time to allow the senior officer to return
it. To prescribe an exact distance for all circumstances is not practical;
however, good judgment should dictate when salutes are exchanged. Superiors
carrying articles in both hands need not return the salute, but should nod in
return or verbally acknowledge the salute. If the junior member is carrying
articles in both hands, verbal greetings should be exchanged. Also, use the
same procedures when greeting an officer of a foreign nation. Use these
procedures in:</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Formation.</b>&nbsp;Members
do not salute or return a salute unless given the command to do so. The person
in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the whole formation.</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.2.<b><i>&nbsp;</i>Groups,
But Not in Formation.</b>&nbsp;When a senior officer approaches, the first individual
noticing the officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer
and salute. If the officer addresses an individual or the group, all remain at
attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the conversation, at
which time they salute the officer.</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Public
Gatherings.&nbsp;</b>Salutes between individuals are not required in public
gatherings, such as sporting events, meetings, or when a salute would be
inappropriate or impractical.</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.4.<b>&nbsp;Moving
Military Vehicles.&nbsp;</b>Exchange of salutes between military pedestrians
(including gate sentries) and officers in moving military vehicles is not
mandatory. However, when officer passengers are readily identifiable (for
example, officers in appropriately marked staff vehicles), the salute must be
rendered.</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.5.<b>&nbsp;The
Presence of Civilians.&nbsp;</b>Persons in uniform may salute civilians. The
President of the U.S., as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, is always
accorded the honor of a salute. AFI 34-1201 provides additional guidance. In
addition, if the exchange of salutes is otherwise appropriate, customs
encourage military members in civilian clothes to exchange salutes upon
recognition.</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.6.<b>&nbsp;A Work
Detail.&nbsp;</b>In a work detail, individual workers do not salute. The person
in charge salutes for the entire detail.</span></p>

<p><span>8.6.1.7.&nbsp;<b>Military
Funeral.&nbsp;</b>When at a military funeral in uniform, salute the caisson or
hearse as it passes and the casket as it is carried by your position. You also
salute during the firing of volleys and the playing of  Taps. </span></p>

<p><span>8.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Indoors.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Except for formal
reporting, salutes are not rendered.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.7. Military Etiquette.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Etiquette is defined as
common, everyday courtesy. The military world, like the civilian world,
functions more smoothly and pleasantly when members practice good manners.</span></p>

<p><span>8.7.1. Simple things
like saying  please  and  thank you  help the organization run smoother because
people respond more enthusiastically when asked in a courteous manner to do
something. They also appreciate knowing their efforts are recognized when told
 thank you. </span></p>

<p><span>8.7.2. One of the most valuable habits anyone
can develop is to be on time for appointments. Granted, sometimes a person
cannot avoid being late. When this happens, the best course of action is to
call ahead or to reschedule the appointment. Do not keep others waiting. 8.7.3.
Address civil service employees properly. As a rule, address them appropriately
as  Mr.,   Mrs.,   Miss,  or  Ms.  and their last name, unless requested to do
otherwise. Always address a superior formally. This is especially important in
most foreign countries where using first names on the job is much more limited
than in the U.S.</span></p>

<p><span>8.7.4. Don t gossip<b><i>.</i></b>&nbsp;A
discussion of personal habits, problems, and activities (real or rumored) of
others often results in quarrels and disputes among people who work together.
The morale of any unit may suffer because of feuds that arise from gossip. The
best policy is not to gossip and to discourage others from gossiping.</span></p>

<p><span>8.7.5.
Use proper telephone etiquette<b><i>.</i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>Always be polite and
identify yourself and your organization. When an individual is not available to
take a call, ask:  May I take a message?  or  Is there something I may help you
with?  If taking a message to return a call, write down the individual's name,
organization, telephone number, the message, and then pass this information
along to the intended recipient.</span></p>

<p><span>8.7.6. Do not lean or
sit on desks. Also, do not lean back in a chair or put feet on desks. This type
of conduct doesn t present a professional military image.</span></p>

<p><span>8.7.7. In general, use
common sense, be considerate of other people, and insist your subordinates do
the same.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.8.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Courtesies to Other Services:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.8.1.
The collective efforts of the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard
provide for the defense of the country against aggression. All Services are
part of the military team; therefore, extend the same military courtesies to
members of the other Services. While there is a friendly natural rivalry
between the Services, military courtesies among Services remain the same. Thus,
the members of the other Services are as much comrades-in-arms as are any
Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>8.8.2.
This is equally true of the friendly armed forces of the United Nations. Salute
all commissioned officers and pay the same respect to the national anthems and
flags of other nations as rendered the U.S. national anthem and flag. While not
necessary to learn the identifying insignia of the military grades of all
nations, you should learn the insignia of the most frequently contacted
nations, particularly during an overseas assignment or deployment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.9. Respect and Recognition:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.9.1.<b>&nbsp;Common Acts of Courtesy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Common acts of courtesy
among all Air Force personnel aid in maintaining discipline and promoting the
smooth conduct of affairs in the military establishment. When courtesy falters
within a unit, discipline ceases to function, and accomplishing the mission is
endangered. Many of the Air Force courtesies involve the salute. There are,
however, many other courtesies commonly extended to superiors, subordinates,
and working associates. Some acts of courtesies include:</span></p>

<p><span>8.9.1.1. Giving the
senior person, enlisted or commissioned, the position of honor when walking,
riding, or sitting with him or her at all times. The junior person takes the
position to the senior's left.</span></p>

<p><span>8.9.1.2. When reporting
to an officer indoors, knock once and enter when told to do so. Upon entering,
march to approximately two paces from the officer or desk, halt, salute, and
report in this manner:  Sir (Ma am), Airman Smith reports as ordered,  or  Sir
(Ma am), Airman Smith reports.  When the conversation is completed, execute a
sharp salute and hold until the officer acknowledges the salute, then perform
the appropriate facing movements and depart.</span></p>

<p><span>8.9.1.3. Unless told
otherwise, rise and stand at attention when a senior official enters or departs
a room. If more than one person is present, the person who first sees the
officer calls the group to attention. However, if an officer is already in the
room who is equal to or has a higher rank than the officer entering the room,
do not call the room to attention.</span></p>

<p><span>8.9.1.4. Military
personnel enter automobiles and small boats in reverse order of rank. Juniors
will enter a vehicle first and take their appropriate seat on the senior s
left. The senior officer will be the last to enter the vehicle and the first to
leave.</span></p>

<p><span>8.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Terms of
Address.&nbsp;</b>For the proper terms of address, refer to Figure 8.16.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 8D Drill and
Ceremony</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>8.10. Flag Ceremonies:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.10.1.<b>&nbsp;Reveille.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The signal for the start
of the official duty day is the reveille. Because the time for the start of the
duty day varies between bases, the commander designates the specified time for
reveille. If the commander desires, a reveille ceremony may accompany the
raising of the flag. This ceremony takes place after sunrise near the base
flagstaff. In the unit area, reveille is normally held using the formation of
squadron in line. This formation is used when a reveille ceremony is not held
at the base flagstaff. Procedures for reveille include:</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.1.1. Shortly before
the specified time, Airmen march to a pre-designated position near the base
flagstaff, halt, face toward the flagstaff, and dress. The flag security detail
arrives at the flagstaff at this time and remains at attention.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.1.2. The unit
commander (or senior participant) commands  Parade, REST. </span></p>

<p><span>8.10.1.3. At the
specified time for reveille, the unit commander commands  SOUND REVEILLE.  The
flag detail assumes the position of attention, moves to the flagstaff, and
attaches the flag to the halyards.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.1.4. After reveille
is played, the unit commander commands  Squadron, ATTENTION  and  Present, ARMS 
and then faces the flagstaff and executes present arms. On this signal, the
national anthem or  To the Colors' is sounded. 8.10.1.5. On the first note of
the national anthem or  To the Colors,  the flag security detail begins to
raise the flag briskly. The senior member of the detail holds the flag to keep
the flag from touching the ground.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.1.6. The unit
commander holds the salute until the last note of the national anthem or  To
the Colors' is played. Then he or she executes order arms, faces about, and
commands  Order, ARMS.  The Airmen are then marched back to the dismissal area.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.2.<b>&nbsp;Raising the Flag:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.10.2.1. When
practical, a detail consisting of one NCO and two Airmen hoists the flag. This
detail should carry sidearms if the special equipment of the guard includes
sidearms.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.2.2. The detail
forms in line with the NCO carrying the flag in the center. The detail then
marches to the flagstaff and halts, and the flag is attached to the halyards.
The flag is always raised and lowered from the leeward side of the flagstaff.
The two Airmen attend the halyards, taking a position facing the staff to hoist
the flag without entangling the halyards.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.2.3. The NCO
continues to hold the flag until hoisted clear of his or her grasp, taking
particular care that no portion of the flag touches the ground. When the flag
is clear of the grasp, the NCO comes to attention and executes present arms.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.2.4. On the last
note of the national anthem,  To the Colors,  or after the flag has been
hoisted to the staff head, all members of the detail execute order arms on
command of the senior member. The halyards are then secured to the cleat of the
staff or, if appropriate, the flag is lowered to half-staff and the halyards
are secured. The detail is formed again and then marches to the dismissal area.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.<b>&nbsp;Retreat Ceremony:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.1. The retreat
ceremony<i>&nbsp;</i>serves a twofold purpose: signals the end of the official
duty day and serves as a ceremony for paying respect to the U.S. flag. Because
the time for the end of the duty day varies, the commander designates the time
for the retreat ceremony. The retreat ceremony may take place at the squadron
area, on the base parade ground, or near the base flagstaff. If conducted
within the squadron area, the ceremony usually does not involve a parade. If
conducted at the base parade ground, retreat may be part of the parade
ceremony. For retreat ceremonies conducted at the base flagstaff, the units
participating may be formed in line or massed, depending on the size and number
of units and the space available.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.2. Shortly before
the specified time for retreat, the band and Airmen participating in the
ceremony are positioned facing the flagstaff and dressed. If marching to and
from the flagstaff, the band precedes the Airmen participating in the ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.3. If the band
and Airmen march to the flagstaff, a flag security detail also marches to the
flagstaff and halts, and the senior member gives the command  Parade, REST  to
the security detail.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.4. As soon as the
Airmen are dressed, the commander commands  Parade, REST.  The commander then
faces the flagstaff, assumes the position of the Airmen, and waits for the
specified time for retreat.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.5. At the
specified time, the commander orders the bandleader to sound retreat by
commanding  SOUND RETREAT. </span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.6. The band plays
retreat. If a band is not present, recorded music is played over the base
public address system. During the playing of retreat, junior members of the
flag security detail assume the position of attention and move to the flagstaff
to arrange the halyards for proper lowering of the flag. Once the halyards are
arranged, the junior members of the flag security detail execute parade rest in
unison.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.7. Uniformed
military members not assigned to a formation face the flag (if visible) or the
music and assume the position of parade rest on the first note of retreat. Upon
completion of retreat, they should assume the position of attention and salute
on the first note of the national anthem or  To the Colors. </span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.8. After the band
plays retreat, the commander faces about and commands  Squadron (Group, etc.),
ATTENTION.  8.10.3.9. The commander then commands  Present, ARMS.  As soon as
the Airmen execute present arms, the commander faces to the front and also
assumes present arms. The members of the flag security detail execute present
arms on command of the commander.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.10. The band
plays the national anthem, or the bugler plays  To the Colors.  The junior
members of the flag security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.11. The commander
executes order arms when the last note of the national anthem or  To the
Colors' is played and the flag is securely grasped. The commander faces about,
gives the Airmen  Order, ARMS,  and then faces to the front.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.3.12. The flag
security detail folds the flag as illustrated in Figure 8.17. The senior member
of the detail remains at attention while the flag is folded unless needed to
control the flag.</span></p>



<p><span>8.10.3.13. When the flag
is folded, the flag security detail, with the senior member on the right and
the flag bearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the
commander. (<b>Note:<i>&nbsp;</i></b>In an informal ceremony, the detail
marches three paces from the officer of the day.) The senior member salutes and
reports  Sir (Ma am), the flag is secured.  The commander returns the salute,
and the flag security detail marches away. The Airmen are then marched to their
areas and dismissed.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.4.<b>&nbsp;Lowering the Flag:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.10.4.1. When
practical, the persons lowering the flag should be one NCO and three Airmen for
the all-purpose flag and one NCO and five Airmen for the installation flag.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.4.2. The detail is

from the leeward side. 8.10.4.3. On the first note of the national anthem or
 To the Colors,  the members of the detail not lowering the flag execute
present arms. The lowering of the flag is coordinated with the playing of the music
so the two are completed at the same time. 8.10.4.4. The senior member commands
the detail  Order, ARMs' when the flag is low enough to be received. If at
half-staff, briskly hoist the flag to the staff head while retreat is sounded
and then lower on the first note of the national anthem or  To the Colors. </span></p>

Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all  should be rendered by standing at attention and facing the
flag. When not in uniform, persons should remove any non-religious headdress
with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand being
over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and
render the military salute if outdoors and indoors if in formation and wearing
appropriate headdress. If indoors and without headdress, military members
should stand at attention, remain silent, and face the flag. Military members
in uniform do not recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.</span></p>

<p><span>8.10.6.<b>&nbsp;Flag Folding Ceremony.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Although several flag
folding ceremony options are offered by various national interest groups, these
are not official Air Force ceremonies. According to Title 4, United States
Code, no specific meaning is assigned to the folds of the flag. The Air Force
developed a script that provides a historical perspective on the flag. There
are no ceremonies in the Air Force requiring a script to be read when the flag
is folded. However, when a flag folding ceremony is desired and conducted by
Air Force personnel at any location, on or off an installation, this script is
the only one that may be used. Refer back to Figure 8.17 for the proper method
for folding the U.S. flag and Figure 8.18 for a copy of this script.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 8.18. Flag Folding Ceremony.</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Flag Folding Ceremony</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Air Force Script&nbsp;</span></b><span>For more than 200 years, the American flag has
been the symbol of our Nation's unity, as well as a source of pride and
inspiration for millions of citizens.</span></p>

<p><span>Born on June 14, 1777,
the Second Continental Congress determined that the flag of the U.S. be 13
stripes, alternating between 7 red and 6 white; and that the union be 13 stars,
white in a blue field representing a new constellation. (1)</span></p>

<p><span>Between 1777 and 1960,
the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before you
today. The 13 horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the
stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic
as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and
innocence; and blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice. (1)</span></p>

<p><span>Traditionally, a symbol
of liberty, the American flag has carried the message of freedom, and inspired
Americans, both at home and abroad.</span></p>

<p><span>In 1814, Francis Scott
Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British
shelling of Baltimore's Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star
Spangled Banner. (2)</span></p>

<p><span>In 1892 the flag
inspired Francis Bellamy to write the  Pledge of Allegiance,  our most famous
flag salute and patriotic oath. (2)</span></p>

<p><span>In July 1969 the
American flag was  flown  in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the
surface of the moon. (2)</span></p>

<p><span>Today, our flag flies on
constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin
flash of our aircraft in harm's way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it
flies in the heart of every Airman who serves our great Nation. The sun never
sets on our U.S. Air Force, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish. (2)</span></p>

<p><span>Since 1776, no
generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending
freedom  Today's Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others
won for us for generations to come.</span></p>

<p><span>By displaying the flag
and giving it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag and express our
gratitude to those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom,
at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly
flown the flag in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world. It
is their responsibility our responsibility to continue to protect and preserve
the rights, privileges, and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today. The
U.S. flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the
pride and patriotism we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy as a beacon
of hope to one and all. Long may it wave.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.11. Air Force Ceremonies.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force has many different types of ceremonies that are unique customs of our
military profession. Some of these ceremonies are very formal and elaborate,
while others are quite simple and personal. Award, decoration, promotion,
reenlistment, and retirement ceremonies are a few of the most common within the
Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Award
Ceremony.&nbsp;</span></b><span>An award ceremony
affords an opportunity to recognize a member's accomplishments. The commander
or other official determines whether to present an award at a formal ceremony
or to present it informally. Many units present awards during commander's call.
Because there are no specific guidelines for an award presentation, commanders
and supervisors must ensure the presentation method reflects the significance
of the award.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Decoration
Ceremony:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.11.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Basic Guidelines.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Decoration ceremonies formally recognize service members for
meritorious service, outstanding achievement, or heroism. A formal and
dignified ceremony is necessary to preserve the integrity and value of
decorations. When possible, the commander should personally present the
decoration. Regardless of where the presentation is conducted, the ceremony is
conducted at the earliest possible date after approval of the decoration. All
military participants and attendees should wear the uniform specified by the
host. If in doubt, the Service Dress rather than the Airman Battle Uniform is
recommended. At the commander's discretion, a photographer may take pictures
during the ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Procedures.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Although
decoration ceremonies may differ slightly from one unit to another, they
normally begin by announcing  ATTENTION TO ORDERS.  All members in attendance
stand at attention and face the commander and the recipient. The commander s
assistant reads the citation while the commander and recipient stand at
attention. After the citation is read, the commander and recipient face each
other, and the commander affixes the medal on the individual's uniform. The
commander next extends personal congratulations and a handshake while presenting
the decoration certificate. The recipient salutes the commander, and the
commander returns the salute to conclude the formal part of the ceremony.
Attendees are then invited to personally congratulate the recipient and enjoy
any refreshments provided.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.3.<b>&nbsp;Promotion Ceremony:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.11.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Basic Guidelines.</span></b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Promotions are
significant events in the lives of military people. Commanders and supervisors
are responsible for ensuring their personnel receive proper recognition. Many
of the guidelines for promotion ceremonies are the same as for decoration
ceremonies. Because most promotions are effective the first day of the month,
the promotion ceremony is customarily conducted on the last duty day before the
promotion. Some bases hold a base-wide promotion for all&nbsp;promotees; many
organizations have operating instructions detailing how promotion ceremonies
will be conducted.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Procedures.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The
national anthem, reaffirmation of the Oath of Enlistment, and the Air Force
Song are options that add decorum to the event.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.4.<b>&nbsp;Reenlistment Ceremony:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.11.4.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Basic Guidelines.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Unit commanders will honor all&nbsp;reenlistees&nbsp;through a
dignified reenlistment ceremony. The Airman may request any commissioned
officer to perform the ceremony and may invite guests. The member's immediate
family should be invited. This reinforces the fact that when a member makes a
commitment to the Air Force, the family is also making a commitment. Any
regular, reserve, guard, or retired commissioned officer of the U.S. Armed Forces
may perform the ceremony, which may be conducted in any place that lends
dignity to the event. The U.S. flag must form a backdrop for the
participants.&nbsp;Reenlistees&nbsp;and reenlisting officers must wear an
authorized uniform for the ceremony.&nbsp;<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;The uniform
requirement is optional for retired officers.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>8.11.4.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Procedures.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The
core of the ceremony is the Oath of Enlistment. The oath<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>is
recited by the officer and repeated by the&nbsp;reenlistee.
The&nbsp;reenlistee&nbsp;and the officer administering the oath must be
physically collocated during the ceremony. Once completed, the officer
congratulates the&nbsp;reenlistee&nbsp;and invites the other attendees to do
the same. Refreshments may be served.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.5.<b>&nbsp;Retirement Ceremony:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.11.5.1.<b>&nbsp;Basic
Guidelines.&nbsp;</b>Recognition upon retirement is a longstanding tradition of
military service. Each commander makes sure members leave with a tangible
expression of appreciation for their contributions to the Air Force mission and
with the assurance they will continue to be a part of the Air Force family in
retirement. Anyone involved in planning a retirement should consult AFI
36-3203,&nbsp;<i>Service Retirements,</i>&nbsp;for complete details. The
following paragraphs are extracts from AFI 36-3203:</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.5.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Commanders are responsible for ensuring members have a retirement
ceremony to recognize their contributions. They must offer the retiring member
the courtesy of a formal ceremony in keeping with the customs and traditions of
the Service. If possible, a general officer conducts the ceremony. Ceremonies held
as part of formal military formations, such as retreats and parades, are
further encouraged if conditions permit.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.5.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>During the retirement ceremony, the member receives a certificate
of retirement, a U.S. Flag, the Air Force retired lapel button, Certificate of
Appreciation for Service in the Armed Forces of the U.S., and appropriate
awards, decorations, honors, and letters of appreciation. If possible, avoid
using  dummy  elements that the member cannot keep. Family members and friends
should be invited and encouraged to attend the ceremony. Furthermore, the
member's spouse is customarily presented with a certificate of appreciation for
the support and sacrifices made during the member's career.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.5.1.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Commanders follow formal ceremony procedures unless the member
prefers otherwise. If the member doesn t want a formal ceremony or for any
reason (leave or hospitalization) can t be present for duty on the retirement
date, the commander personally presents all decorations and any awards or honors
to the member at another time. The retirement certificate is not mailed to the
member's retirement address unless there is no other choice.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.5.2.<b>&nbsp;Procedures.&nbsp;</b>AFPAM
34-1202 outlines an approved sequence of events for indoor retirement
ceremonies. Figure 8.19 provides a general guideline that may be used to assist
in planning a retirement ceremony as well as many other ceremonies.</span></p>

<p><span>8.11.5.2.1.
Common ceremonies recognizing an individual, such as a retirement ceremony,
routinely combine official actions that maintain the dignity and respect of
long standing Air Force traditions with a member's desire to personalize the ceremony
for family and invited guests.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.12. Special Ceremonies and Events.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Dining-In,
Dining-Out, and Order of the Sword Induction ceremonies are social events that
have become valued traditions in the military.</span></p>

<p><span>8.12.1.<b>&nbsp;The Dining-In and Dining-Out:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.12.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The only difference between a Dining-In and Dining-Out is that
nonmilitary spouses, friends, and civilians may attend a Dining-Out. The
Dining-In is a formal dinner for military members only. The present Dining-In
format had its beginnings in the Air Corps when General Henry H.  Hap  Arnold
held his famous wingdings. The association of Army Air Corps personnel with the
British and their Dining-In during World War II also encouraged their
popularity in the Air Force. Members now recognize the Dining-In as an occasion
where ceremony, tradition, and good fellowship serve an important purpose.</span></p>

<p><span>8.12.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Specifically, these ceremonies provide an occasion for Air Force
members to meet socially at formal military functions. They also provide an
excellent means of saying farewell to departing members and welcoming new ones,
as well as providing the opportunity to recognize individual and unit
achievements. These are effective in building and maintaining high morale and
esprit de corps. Military members who attend these ceremonies must wear the
mess dress or the semiformal uniform. Civilians wear the dress specified in the
invitations.</span></p>

<p><span>8.12.2.<b>&nbsp;The Order of the Sword Induction
Ceremony.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Induction into the Order
of the Sword is an honor reserved for individuals who have provided outstanding
leadership and support to enlisted members. The induction ceremony occurs at a
formal evening banquet held to honor the inductee as a  Leader among Leaders
and an Airman among Airmen.  The entire event is conducted with the dignity
that reflects its significance as the highest recognition enlisted member can
bestow on anyone. Each command has an Order of the Sword and develops their own
selection and induction procedures.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.13. Drill:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.13.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Introduction
to Drill.</span></b></p>

<p><span>For the purpose of
drill, Air Force organizations are divided into elements, flights, squadrons,
groups, and wings. Drill consists of certain movements by which the flight or
squadron is moved in an orderly manner from one formation to another or from
one place to another. Standards such as the 24-inch step, cadence of 100 to 120
steps per minute, distance, and interval were established to ensure movements
are executed with order and precision. The task of each person is to learn
these movements and execute each part exactly as described. Individuals must
also learn to adapt their own movements to those of the group. Everyone in the
formation must move together on command.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Drill
and Ceremony.</span></b></p>

<p><span>While the term
 ceremony  was defined earlier in this chapter, you should be note that certain
ceremonies use drill. In these events, ceremonies not only honor distinguished
persons and recognize special events, but also demonstrate the proficiency and
training state of the Airmen. Ceremonies are an extension of drill activities.
The precision marching, promptness in responding to commands, and teamwork
developed on the drill field determine the appearance and performance of the
group in ceremonies. The following paragraphs cover only the basic aspects of
drill. For more information, see AFMAN 36-2203,<i>&nbsp;Drill and Ceremonies</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Types
of Commands:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.13.3.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Drill Command.</span></b><span>&nbsp;A
drill command is an oral order that usually has two parts: the preparatory
command and the command of execution. The preparatory command explains what the
movement will be. When calling a unit to attention or halting a unit's march,
the preparatory command includes the unit designation. In the command  Flight,
HALT,  the word  Flight  is the preparatory command and, at the same time,
designates the unit. The command of execution follows the preparatory command.
The command of execution explains when the movement will be carried out. In
 Forward, MARCH,  the command of execution is  MARCH. </span></p>

<p><span>8.13.3.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Supplementary Command.</span></b><span>&nbsp;A supplementary command is given when one unit of the
element must execute a movement different from other units or the same movement
at a different time. Examples include:  CONTINUE THE MARCH  and  STAND FAST. </span></p>

<p><span>8.13.3.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Informational Command.&nbsp;</span></b><span>An informational command has no preparatory command or command of
execution and is not supplementary; this command is used to direct others to
give commands. Examples are:</span></p>

<p><span> PREPARE FOR INSPECTION 
and  DISMISS THE SQUADRON. </span></p>

<p><span>8.13.3.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Mass Commands.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The mass commands<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>help develop confidence, self-reliance,
assertiveness, and enthusiasm by making the individual recall, give, and
execute proper commands. Mass commands are usually confined to simple
movements, with short preparatory commands and commands of execution carried
out simultaneously by all elements of a unit. Each person is required to give
commands in unison with others as if this person alone were giving the commands
to the entire element. The volume of the combined voices encourages every
person to perform the movement with snap and precision.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>General
Rules for Giving Commands.</span></b></p>

<p><span>When giving commands,
the commander is at the position of attention. Good military bearing is
necessary for good leadership. While marching, the commander must be in step
with the formation at all times. The commander faces the Airmen when giving
commands except when the element is part of a larger drill element or when the
commander is relaying commands in a ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Drill
Positions:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.13.5.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Attention.<i>&nbsp;</i></span></b><span>To come to attention, bring the heels together smartly and on
line. Place the heels as near each other as the conformation of the body
permits and ensure the feet are turned out equally to form a 45-degree angle.
Keep the legs straight without stiffening or locking the knees. The body is erect
with hips level, chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders square and even. Arms
hang straight down alongside the body without stiffness and the wrists are
straight with the forearms. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first
joint of the forefinger, along the seams of the trousers or sides of the skirt.
Hands are cupped (but not clenched as a fist) with palms facing the leg. The
head is kept erect and held straight to the front, with the chin drawn slightly
so the axis of the head and neck is vertical; eyes are to the front with the
line of sight parallel to the ground. The weight of the body rests equally on
the heels and balls of both feet. Silence and immobility are required.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.5.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Rest Positions.</span></b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>There are four positions
of rest: parade rest, at ease, rest, and fall out. The commander and members of
the formation must be at the position of attention before going to any of the
rest positions. To resume the position of attention from any of the rests
(except fall out, for which the commander uses the command  FALL IN ), the
command is  Flight, ATTENTION. </span></p>

<p><span>8.13.5.2.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Parade Rest.</span></b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>(The command is  Parade, REST. ) On the command
 REST,  members of the formation raise the left foot from the hip just enough
to clear the ground and move smartly to the left so the heels are 12 inches
apart, as measured from the inside of the heels. Keep the legs straight but not
stiff and the heels on line. As the left foot moves, bring the arms, fully
extended, to the back of the body,&nbsp;uncupping&nbsp;the hands in the process;
extend and join the fingers, pointing them toward the ground. Face the palms
outwards. Place the right hand in the palm of the left, right thumb over the
left to form an  X.  Keep the head and eyes straight ahead and remain silent
and immobile.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.5.2.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>At Ease.</span></b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>On the command  AT EASE,  members of the
formation may relax in a standing position, but they must keep the right foot
in place. Their position in the formation will not change; silence is
maintained.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.5.2.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Rest.</span></b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>On the command  REST,  the same requirements for
at ease apply, but moderate speech is permitted.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.5.2.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Fall Out.&nbsp;</span></b><span>On
the command  FALL OUT,  individuals may relax in a standing position or break
ranks.</span></p>

<p><span>They must remain in the
immediate area; no specific method of dispersal is required. Moderate speech is
permitted.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>The
Flight as the Basic Drill Unit.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The first phase of drill
involves teaching basic movements, facings, and positions either as an
individual or as a member of an element. The second phase of drill merges the
individual with others to form a flight in which base formations and marching
are learned. The flight is composed of at least two, but no more than four,
elements. This formation is the most practical drill group.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Formation of the Flight:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.13.7.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A flight forms in a line formation at the command of  FALL IN 
(Figure 8.20).&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Usually, the flight sergeant forms and
dismisses the flight formation.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.7.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>On this command, each Airman will fall in and establish their
dress, cover, interval, and distance. Once established, each Airman executes an
automatic ready front on an individual basis and remains at the position of
attention.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.7.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The flight commander will then size the flight. Once all members
are properly sized and in column formation (Figure 8.21), the flight commander
brings the flight back to line formation.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.7.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>To align the flight in line formation, the commands are  Dress
Right, DRESs' and  Ready, FRONT. </span></p>

<p><span>8.13.7.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The flight commander verifies the alignment of each rank then
marches to three paces beyond the front rank, faces toward the flight, and
commands  Ready, FRONT.  With as few movements as possible, the flight
commander then takes the normal position in front of the flight by the most
direct route.</span></p>

in line at normal interval. On the command  MARCH,  the fourth rank stands fast
and automatically executes dress right dress. The third rank takes one pace,
the second rank takes two, and the first rank takes three paces forward. The
flight commander aligns the flight, then commands  Ready, FRONT. </span></p>

<p><span>8.13.8.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The inspector and commander proceed to inspect the flight, if
required.</span></p>

<p><span>8.13.8.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>After inspecting the entire flight, the inspector marches off to
the right flank (element leaders) of the flight. The flight commander calls the
flight to attention. The flight commander then commands  Close Ranks, MARCH. 
On the command  MARCH,  the first rank stands fast. The second rank takes one
pace forward and halts at the position of attention. The third and fourth ranks
take two and three paces forward, respectively, and halt at attention.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 8E Honor Guard, Protocol, Distinguished Visitors, and
Military Ceremonies</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>8.14. Base Honor Guard Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.14.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The primary mission of the base honor guard program is to employ,
equip, and train Air Force members to provide professional military funeral
honors for Regular Air Force, retired members, and veterans of the U.S. Air
Force. The Base Honor Guard Program is a mandatory Air Force program and is the
responsibility of the installation commander. Members are usually volunteers
from the installation host and tenant units, with selections generally coming
from the installation's Airman Basic to Technical Sergeant pool. The base honor
guard emphasizes the importance of military customs and courtesies, dress and
appearance, and drill and ceremonies.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>8.14.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The origins of the base honor guard can be traced to May 1948 when
Headquarters Command, U.S. Air Force, directed the creation of an elite
ceremonial unit comparable to those of the other Services. The first base honor
guard was activated within the 1100th Air Police
Squadron,&nbsp;Bolling&nbsp;Field, Washington District of Columbia, and was
responsible for maintaining an Air Force ceremonial capability in the National
Capitol Region. However, other Air Force installations worldwide approached
ceremonial responsibilities and military funeral honors quite differently.</span></p>

<p><span>8.14.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In January of 2000, public law was implemented, providing for all
veterans to receive, at a minimum, a funeral ceremony that includes the folding
of a U.S. flag, presentation of the flag to the veteran's family, and the
playing of  Taps. </span></p>

<p><b><span>8.15.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Protocol
Defined.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Protocol is the set of
rules prescribing good manners in official life and in ceremonies involving
governments and nations and their representatives. Protocol is an
internationally recognized system of courtesy and respect. Protocol for the
military and government agencies is a code of traditional precedence, courtesy,
and etiquette in matters of military, diplomatic, official, and celebratory
ceremonies. Military protocol encompasses the knowledge, accumulation and
application of established service customs. In modern practice, protocol
combines the traditional codes of conduct with contemporary etiquette and
courtesy. The goal is to avoid disputes, insults, embarrassment, and
distractions by following a set of objective and generally accepted criteria.
As times change, so do the manners of the people; protocol must keep pace with
developing official life. Though only a guide, the following sections will help
you avoid protocol pitfalls.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.16.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Distinguished
Visitors (DV):</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.16.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A DV may be defined as any: (1) general or flag officer; (2) government
official with rank equivalent to a brigadier general or higher; (3) foreign
military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary of the Air
Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA); and (4) visitor or group designated
by the commander. Also, persons of lower rank, but in certain positions, may be
given DV status. At base level, for example, colonels, civilian equivalents,
and the Command Chief Master Sergeant may be designated as DV by the commander.
Many distinguished dignitaries, military and civilian, domestic and foreign,
visit Air Force installations for festive occasions and official business.
Reducing the frequency of ceremonial honors rendered official visitors at field
installations is of high importance. In the interest of economy and efficiency,
such ceremonies as parades, honor cordons, motorcades, and other ceremonies
that involve large numbers of Airmen and equipment will be held to an absolute
minimum when officials entitled to such honors visit military installations. In
general, full honors are reserved for statutory appointees and general or flag
officers of the military Services, foreign dignitaries, and occasions when
ceremonies promote international good will. The installation commander
determines which types of honors are rendered. Enlisted personnel are
frequently appointed as project NCOs for ceremonies, officials at social
events, or escorts for visiting DVs.</span></p>

<p><span>8.16.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Project NCOs represent their organization or their base and are
responsible for assisting DVs. A smooth visit requires planning before the
visit. Review AFI 34-1201 and AFPAM 34-1202 for further guidance on
responsibilities and proper procedures.<b>&nbsp;</b>Contact guests beforehand
to find out if they desire special arrangements. The base protocol office may
also need to know guests' transportation needs. Other duties may include
preregistering guests, meeting them upon arrival, and escorting them to their
next destination.</span></p>

<p><span>8.16.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Place a tentative itinerary and welcome package in the guest
quarters. Include such items as a recent base newspaper, unit or base history,
telephone numbers of base facilities, maps of the base and local area, and most
importantly, the visit point of contact information. Also appropriate are
biographies on the installation or host commander and Command Chief Master
Sergeant, host Professional Military Education commandants and program
managers, and Chief</span></p>

<p><span>Master Sergeants and
first sergeants (in the case of a senior enlisted DV, such as the Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force). Include instructions on operating difficult-to-use
appliances or machines, using the telephone system, and computer connection
information in the guest quarters.</span></p>

<p><span>8.16.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Give a thorough&nbsp;prebriefing&nbsp;to the guest speaker at a
special function, such as a Dining-In. Guests may have several commitments
other than the primary project. If so, make sure they have schedules that allow
time for meetings, telephone calls, meals, changes of clothes, coffee breaks,
occasional rest periods, and transportation. Common practice is to leave 2
hours between the end-of-the-day activities and the start of evening functions.</span></p>

<p><span>8.16.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Determine transportation time by physically traveling from place
to place before the schedule is set. Allow extra time for boarding vehicles and
transferring baggage or luggage. For large official parties, be sure to brief
all drivers on the schedule and give explicit directions so they can operate
independently if they become separated. Ensure they  dry run  the routes to
avoid delays due to roadwork, stoplight outages, or road closures. Arrange the
lodging checkout time and bill payment method. Arrange flight meals if the
guests are leaving by military aircraft and desire this service. Smooth visits
can make a lasting positive impression. If you run into difficulty or have
questions, do not hesitate to contact the base protocol office.</span></p>

<p><span>8.16.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>A DV's visit is an important event in the day-to-day life of an
organization. Everyone wants to make a good impression whether the visitor is a
representative of Congress, foreign dignitary, or city mayor. Problems with
these visits are avoided through strict attention to detail from the
preplanning for arrival to luggage handling, dinner arrangements, and departure
plans. Remember, you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.17.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>General
Information.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The enlisted corps has a
variety of programs to recognize individuals for outstanding performance,
achievements, contributions, and promotions to the senior noncommissioned
officer grades. AFI 36-2805,&nbsp;<i>Special Trophies and Awards</i>, provides
information on a variety of programs but is not all-inclusive. Senior
noncommissioned officers should become familiar with the induction of newly
promoted Master Sergeants into the  Top 3.  They should also become familiar
with the Order of the Sword Ceremony (reference AFI 36-2824,&nbsp;<i>Order of
the Sword Programs</i>) and retirement ceremonies.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.18.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Order
of the Sword:</span></b></p>

<p><span>8.18.1.<b>&nbsp;Background:</b></span></p>

<p><span>8.18.1.1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The Order of the Sword is patterned after an
order of chivalry founded during the Middle Ages the Swedish Royal Order of the
Sword. The rank of NCO was established in the early 12th century. In 1522,
Swedish King&nbsp;Gustavus&nbsp;I enjoined the noblemen commissioned by him to
appoint officers to serve him. Those appointed were accountants, builders,
crafts people, teachers, scribes, and others conducting the daily kingdom
affairs. The system worked so well it was incorporated into the Swedish Army as
a way to establish and maintain a cohesive, disciplined, and well-trained
force. This force ensured the protection of lives and property in the kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span>8.18.1.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Ancient NCOs would honor their leader and pledge their loyalty by
ceremoniously presenting him with a sword. The sword a symbol of truth,
justice, and power rightfully used served as a token for all to see and know
that here was a  leader among leaders.  The ceremony became known as The Royal
Order of the Sword. The first recorded use in the U.S. was in the 1860s when
General Robert E. Lee was presented a sword by his command.</span></p>

<p><span>8.18.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>The
Current Ceremony.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Royal Order of the
Sword ceremony was revised, updated, and adopted by Air Force NCOs in 1967. The
Order of the Sword was established by the Air Force enlisted force to recognize
and honor military senior officers, colonel or above, and civilian equivalents,
for conspicuous and significant contributions to the welfare and prestige of
the Air Force enlisted force mission effectiveness as well as the overall
military establishment.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The Order of the Sword is the highest honor and
tribute NCOs can bestow upon an individual.</span></p>

<p><span>8.18.3.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Approved
Swords.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The only approved swords
are at the Air Force level (Air Force Sword) and major command level (Major
Command Sword). The Air Force Sword is reserved for those deserving senior
leaders who serve outside the major command structure. The Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force maintains the Air Force Sword. The Major commands
maintain the Major Command Swords and ensure they are reserved for those
deserving senior leaders who serve or have served within the awarding major
command.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Each major command establishes additional
guidelines not already covered in AFI 36-2824. An Order of the Sword executive
committee is responsible for developing guidelines, nomination procedures,
approval or disapproval of any nominations submitted, and protocol of the
induction ceremony. The committee must also approve the nomination. The Chief
Master Sergeant of the Air Force or major command's Command Chief Master
Sergeant (depending on level of award), is known as the  keeper of the sword, 
and usually chairs the committee.</span></p>

<p><span>8.18.4.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Nomination
and Selection.</span></b></p>

<p><span>NCOs wishing to nominate
a qualified officer or civilian for induction into the Order of the Sword
should contact their Command Chief Master Sergeant and refer to AFI 36-2824 for
processing procedures. (<b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Do not inform the nominee of the
possible induction.) The nomination folder should include a cover memorandum,
biographical sketch, and brief justification. Ensure the nomination is thorough
enough so the committee can carefully weigh the individual's merits. The Chief
Master Sergeant of the Air Force or major command Chief Master Sergeant
(depending on level of award) informs the nominating organization of the
decision and provides appropriate guidance and procedures as necessary.</span></p>

<p><span>8.18.5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Preparation
for the Ceremony.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Once the nomination is
approved, a ceremony committee will form and begin planning the ceremony.
Preparations required for the Order of the Sword ceremony are similar to those
for the Dining-In discussed in this chapter. Host NCOs are responsible for
planning, executing, and paying for the ceremony. This includes the dinner,
awards and presentations to be made to the honoree, ceremonial equipment (such
as individual swords), and printed proclamations.</span></p>

<p><span>8.18.6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Induction
Ceremony.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This evening affair
usually consists of a social period, formal dinner, and induction ceremony. The
required dress is the mess dress or semiformal uniform. The ceremony should be
well rehearsed to reflect formality, dignity, and prestige. Four key
participants have speaking parts and other duties: the Chief Master Sergeant of
the mess,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>first sergeant, duty sergeant, and sergeant at
arms. Major command directives provide specific guidance for NCOs serving in
these positions.</span></p>

<p><span>8.18.7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>Permanent
Recognition in the Order of the Sword.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force maintains the official list of Order of the Sword
recipients. Each sponsoring command maintains a master sword designed for their
ceremonies. This sword is on display at each command's headquarters. A
nameplate commemorating the command's inductions is affixed to its command
master sword.</span></p>

<p><b><span>8.19. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military customs and
courtesies are proven traditions, acts of respect and courtesy, and signs of
the mutual respect and fraternity that exist among military personnel. Military
customs and courtesies play an extremely important role in building morale,
esprit de corps, discipline, and mission effectiveness. This chapter outlines
customs and courtesies, providing an extensive but not all-inclusive outline of
what makes the Air Force and the people special. These ceremonies represent
many customs and traditions of our Air Force heritage. They are very real
aspects of life, and, in the aggregate, form the special culture and lifestyle
uniquely characteristic of the military profession. This guidance is offered to
empower you with the knowledge that can add comfort to your daily social
interactions. Apply using common sense. The guidelines in this chapter can help
avoid protocol pitfalls.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Chapter 9</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>THE NONCOMMISSIONED
OFFICER</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 9A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>9.1. Introduction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.1.1. Noncommissioned
officers (NCO) are the backbone of the Air Force. The organization's success or
failure, strengths or weaknesses can be directly related to the effectiveness
of its NCOs. This chapter begins by discussing the philosophy, purpose, and
structure of the enlisted force. Next, it explores the ranks, roles,
responsibilities and developmental levels for Junior Enlisted Airmen, NCOs and
senior noncommissioned officers. In addition, it briefly describes those
special positions entrusted to senior NCO, such as Air Force Career Field
Manager, first sergeant, Command Chief Master Sergeant, and Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>9.1.2.
Regardless of rank, every enlisted Airman supports the Profession of Arms to
defend the interests of the state, by force and death, when required. This
charge is unique to the military profession, and is a calling that requires
devotion to service and willingness to sacrifice far beyond that required in
other professions. The military as a profession and its core values and
supporting ideas are concepts that epitomize the  NCO.  Finally, the purpose
for including this chapter within AFH 1,&nbsp;<i>Airman</i>&nbsp;is to provide
enlisted Airmen reference material to support their promotion tests.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 9B The Enlisted
Force Structure</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>9.2. Philosophy:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.2.1.
The enlisted force is a diverse corps of functionally and operationally
specialized Airmen in the Profession of Arms. Despite the differences across
functional and operational lines, there is a compelling need for a deliberate
and common approach to force development, career progression, and the
assumption of increased supervisory and leadership responsibilities. To best
leverage our&nbsp;resources&nbsp;we must have a consistent, well-defined set of
expectations, standards, and opportunities for growth for&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>Airmen,
regardless of rank or specialty. The enlisted force structure provides this
consistency and common approach. It defines us as&nbsp;<i>Airmen first</i>,&nbsp;<i>specialists
second</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>9.2.2.
All elements of the enlisted force structure reflect the Air Force core values
(Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do), and are
essential to the profession of arms. The core values are the basis for Air
Force policies, guidance, and overall focus.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.3. Purpose of the Force Structure:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.3.1. The enlisted
force structure provides the framework for a force structure that best meets
mission requirements, while developing institutional and occupational
competencies.</span></p>

<p><span>9.3.2. The enlisted
force structure defines the tiers, ranks, terms of address, roles,
expectations, key positions and approved duty titles for the enlisted force.</span></p>

<p><span>9.3.3. Additionally, the
enlisted force structure provides a framework for supervisors as they set
standards during initial feedback sessions, evaluate progress during mid-term
feedback sessions, and document performance on annual reports.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.4. Air Force Leadership Levels.</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.4.1. The Air Force
operates in a dynamic global context across multiple domains requiring
leadership skills at three distinct levels: tactical expertise, operational
competence, and strategic vision. These levels emphasize a different mix of
qualities and experience. The leadership level at which an Airman operates
determines the institutional competencies (see paragraph 9.20) required to lead
Airmen in mission accomplishment. As shown in Figure 9.1, as Airmen progress
from the tactical expertise to strategic vision leadership levels, emphasis on
the use of institutional competencies shifts from personal to organizational,
with a generally consistent focus on people/team competencies. The nature and
scope of leadership challenges as well as preferred leadership methods differ
based on the level of leadership and duties. In addition, these levels apply
across the entire spectrum of the enlisted force structure (Figure 9.2).</span></p>

<p><span>9.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Tactical Expertise Level.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This
level is predominantly direct and face-to-face and focused on personal
competencies. At the tactical expertise level, Airmen gain a general
understanding of team leadership and an appreciation for organization
leadership. They master their core duty skills, develop experiences in applying
those skills, and begin to acquire the knowledge and experience that will
produce the qualities essential to effective leadership. Airmen at the tactical
expertise level gain the training, education and experience to become the Air
Force's primary technicians and specialists. They learn about themselves as
leaders and how their leadership acumen can affect others through the use of
ethical leadership.</span></p>

<p><span>They assimilate into the
Air Force culture and adopt the Air Force Core Values. Airmen at this level
focus on honing followership abilities, motivating subordinates and influencing
peers to accomplish the mission while developing a warrior ethos. They learn
about themselves and their impact on others in roles as both follower and
leader in addition to developing their communication skills. The primary focus
at the tactical expertise level is accomplishing the missions as effectively
and efficiently as possible using available personnel and resources.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure
9.2. Enlisted Force Development</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>9.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Operational Competence Level.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
full-spectrum of institutional competencies is balanced across the operational
competence leadership level. At this level, Airmen understand the broader Air Force
perspective and the integration of diverse people and capabilities in
operational execution. They transition from specialists to leaders with a
broader enterprise perspective who understand Air Force operational
capabilities. Based on a thorough understanding of themselves as leaders and
followers, Airmen apply an understanding of organizational and team dynamics.
They lead teams by developing and inspiring others, taking care of people, and
taking advantage of diversity. They foster collaborative relationships through
building teams and coalitions, especially within large organizations, and
negotiate with others, often external to the organization. Airmen operating at
this leadership level normally work below the major command or Headquarters Air
Force levels. The majority of enlisted Airmen operate at the tactical expertise
and operational competence levels.</span></p>

<p><span>9.4.4.&nbsp;<b>Strategic Vision Level.</b></span></p>

<p><span>At
this level, Airmen combine highly developed personal and people/team
institutional competencies to apply broad organizational competencies. They
develop a deep understanding of Air Force capabilities and how Airmen achieve
synergistic results and desired effects with their operational capabilities.
They also understand how the Air Force operates within joint, multinational,
and interagency relationships. At the strategic vision level, an Airman employs
military capabilities, applying the operational and strategic arts with a
thorough understanding of unit capabilities, the Air Force at large, and joint
and coalition forces. They have an enterprise perspective with a thorough
understanding of the structure and relationships needed to accomplish strategic
objectives. The strategic vision level focuses on the effects an Airman can
have across a major command, a theater, the Air Force, or even other Services
or the Department of Defense. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
(CMSAF) and few other senior NCOs assigned to higher headquarters operate at
this level.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.5. Enlisted Force Structure Tiers, Ranks and
Roles.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
enlisted force structure is comprised of three distinct and separate tiers,
each correlating to increased levels of education, training, and experience,
which build increasing levels of proficiency. The tiers are Junior Enlisted
Airmen, Noncommissioned Officer, and Senior Noncommissioned Officer, with
multiple ranks in each tier. Each rank includes an official abbreviation and
term of address, as outlined below. Unofficial terms for ranks are not
appropriate terms of address (e.g., Tech, Senior, etc.); however, Airmen senior
or equivalent to the member may use first names and/or call signs. The three
tiers correlate to increased leadership and managerial responsibilities, with
each tier building on the responsibilities of the previous one. Therefore, senior
NCOs are expected to have mastered NCO responsibilities. Likewise, NCOs are
expected to have mastered Junior Enlisted Airmen responsibilities. The primary
goal in each tier is mission accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.1.&nbsp;<b>The Junior Enlisted Airman Tier.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This tier consists of
airman basic, airman, airman first class, and senior airman. Initial enlisted
accessions enter the Air Force in this tier (airman basic, airman, or airman
first class), and focus on adapting to military requirements, being part of the
profession of arms, achieving occupational proficiency, and learning how to be
highly productive members of the Air Force. In this tier, Airmen prepare for
increased responsibilities and ensure they are trained, qualified, and ready to
operate, both at home station and in an expeditionary environment. Junior
Enlisted Airmen are introduced to the institutional competencies and continue
to broaden their technical skills.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Airman
Basic and newly enlisted Airmen.</b>&nbsp;Airmen basics, as well as Airmen who
initially enlist into the Air Force at the airman or airman first class rank,
are primarily adapting to the requirements of the military profession,
acquiring knowledge of military customs, courtesies, and Air Force standards,
as well as striving to attain occupational proficiency. At their first duty
station, they perform basic tasks under close supervision. The written
abbreviation for airman basic is  AB  and the official term of address is
 Airman Basic  or  Airman. </span></p>

<p><span>9.5.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Airman.</b>&nbsp;Airmen
are still learning and adapting to the military profession, and are expected to
understand and conform to military standards, customs, and courtesies. Airmen
begin to show occupational proficiency at basic tasks and still require
significant supervision and support. The written abbreviation is  Amn  and the
official term of address is  Airman. </span></p>

<p><span>9.5.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Airman
First Class.</b>&nbsp;Airmen first class fully comply with Air Force standards
and devote time to increasing their skills in their career fields and the
military profession, while becoming effective team members. After a short time
at their first duty station, they are often skilled on numerous tasks.
Continued supervision is essential to ongoing occupational and professional
growth. Typically, the 5-skill level is earned at this grade. The written
abbreviation is  A1C  and the official term of address is  Airman First Class 
or  Airman. </span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 9.3. CMSAF</span></b></p>



<p><span>9.5.3.4.&nbsp;<b>Chief
Master Sergeant of the Air Force.</b>&nbsp;The CMSAF is the senior enlisted
leader of the Air Force and takes precedence over all enlisted members. The
CMSAF provides leadership to the enlisted force and advises the Chief of Staff
of the Air Force, Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman Joint chief of Staff,
and the Secretary of Defense on enlisted matters. The CMSAF communicates with
the force, serves on boards and committees for numerous organizations affecting
Airmen, testifies before congress, and is the Air Force career field manager
for command chief master sergeants and group superintendents. The CMSAF also
consults with sister service senior enlisted advisors on issues affecting all
enlisted members; engages with foreign military leadership regarding theater
security cooperation and partner nation development efforts; represents the Air
Force to the American public, professional organizations and the media; and
manages the Air Force Order of the Sword Program. The written abbreviation is
 CMSAF  and the official term of address is  Chief Master Sergeant of the Air
Force  or  Chief.  The idea of creating a CMSAF position surfaced as early as
1964 when the Air Force Association's Airman Advisory Council presented the
idea. At that time, Air Force leadership rejected the proposal, fearing that
such a position would undermine the formal chain of command. Purposeful action
did not come until 1966 when Congressman Mendel Rivers introduced a bill that
would mandate each of the Services to appoint a senior NCO. Congressman Rivers
became convinced that the Air Force needed to follow the example of the Marine
Corps (which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in
1957) and the Army (which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the
Army in 1965) and appoint a senior enlisted advisor to the Chief of Staff of
the Air Force. Although the Rivers bill never passed, the Air Force recognized
the tremendous support behind the proposal. On 24 October 1966, Chief of Staff
of the Air Force General John P. McConnell announced the newly created position
of CMSAF. In April 1967, Chief Paul W. Airey became the first to wear the
unique insignia with the wreath around the star. Over the next decade, support
for the office grew among senior leaders and within the enlisted force. Today,
the CMSAF wears the chevron depicted in Figure 9.3. To date,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>17 individuals have previously served in this office. The present
CMSAF,&nbsp;Kaleth&nbsp;O. Wright, took office in February 2017.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.1.&nbsp;<b>CMSAF Paul Wesley Airey:&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="162" height="246" src="afh1_files/image211.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.1.1. Paul Wesley
Airey enlisted in the Army Air Forces as a radio operator on 16 November 1942.
By the height of World War II, he was serving as an aerial gunner aboard B-24
bombers. While in Europe, Airey and his crew were shot down over Vienna,
Austria, captured, and held prisoner by the Germans from July 1944 to May 1945.
During the Korean conflict, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for creating a
means of constructing equipment from salvaged parts, improving corrosion
control of sensitive radio and radar components. Following the war, Airey took
the job of first sergeant, a position he later said was one of the most
important in the Air Force. He subsequently served as first sergeant for six
squadrons at four bases over the next 12 years before being appointed to the
highest NCO position.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.1.2. Upon
assuming his new responsibilities, CMSAF Airey began tackling the problem of
personnel retention, an issue he identified as one of the greatest challenges
he faced. The first-term reenlistment rate was the lowest it had been in 12
years, but Airey did not attribute the great decline to the unpopularity of the
war in Vietnam. He felt it was the consequence of  poor pay, numerous remote
assignments, good civilian employment opportunities, and an inequitable
promotion system.  He became an advisor to a committee to investigate and
recommend a more equitable system. His efforts helped produce the Weighted
Airman Promotion System which was adopted in 1970, eliminating local enlisted
promotion boards and equalizing promotion opportunities across career fields.
In retirement, Airey continued to be an enlisted advocate and spoke to Airmen
around the force. CMSAF Airey died in 2009.</span></p>



<p><span>9.5.3.4.2.&nbsp;<b>CMSAF Donald L. Harlow:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="159" height="246" src="afh1_files/image212.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.2.1. Born in
Waterville, Maine, Donald L. Harlow was the youngest of nine children. At age
22, after working a variety of jobs to help support his mother and pay his
tuition at a private preparatory school, he was drafted into the Army Air
Corps. Serving as an armament and gunnery instructor, he taught cadets to
fieldstrip and reassemble their weapons and to synchronize firing guns through
aircraft propellers. He transferred to the personnel career field in 1945 and
advanced to the grade of Staff Sergeant before his February 1946 discharge from
active duty. During the Korean War, Harlow was recalled to active duty, holding
various positions in the personnel career field. At 16 years of service, he was
promoted to Chief Master Sergeant and was the personnel Sergeant Major for
Headquarters United States European Command and the Sergeant Major for the
Executive Services Division, Office of the Vice Chief of Staff.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.2.2. As the
second to take the reins, CMSAF Harlow continued to cut a path through the
misunderstanding, confusion, and mistrust that surrounded the CMSAF Ever
vigilant, he campaigned for and refined the newly established Weighted Airman
Promotion System, garnered continued flight&nbsp;pay&nbsp;for NCOs attending
in-residence PME and worked toward equal per diem for enlisted and officers.
During Vietnam, he directed his attention to where he felt it was most needed:
young Airmen and their issues, including racial tension, assignment concerns,
and promotion problems. Known for his no-nonsense approach and keen ability to
listen, Harlow advised the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on matters of true
concern to the enlisted force. While many of his recommendations did not result
in policy changes during his tenure, he planted the seeds for future change.
After retiring, Chief Harlow was a strong lobbyist for enlisted equality. CMSAF
Harlow died in 1997.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.3.&nbsp;<b>CMSAF Richard D.&nbsp;Kisling:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="161" height="246" src="afh1_files/image213.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.3.1. Richard
D.&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;and his 10 siblings were raised on a farm in Iowa during
the Great Depression and the dust bowl years. The patriotism he developed
during his childhood was called on when he was drafted into the Army's combat
infantry in 1945 during the effort to reconstitute the number of soldiers
driving through France. After training and deployment
times,&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;arrived in France a month before the war in Europe
ended. His unit assumed responsibility for negotiating the repatriation of displaced
Soviets. From there,&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;separated from the service for civilian
life. After a few months spent missing the camaraderie, he reenlisted for a
brief stint in the Army. In 1947, he joined the Army Air Forces, serving first
as a clerk and later a personnel specialist. Upon his promotion to Senior
Master Sergeant in September 1958, he was among the first group of Air Force
enlisted members to wear the super grades of Senior Master Sergeant and Chief
Master Sergeant.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.3.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Once
assigned to the Pentagon, CMSAF&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;found the enlisted force
struggling through the development of a new Air Force. After talking with
several base officials, it was determined that the Air Force needed to develop
their NCOs like they did their officers. So&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;placed concerns
for NCO professional development in the forefront of discussion at the
Pentagon. His persistence paid off when the first senior NCO academy was
approved by Congress in 1972. The Academy officially opened its doors in
January 1973; however, before the Academy opened its doors, the original plan
was to restrict its attendance to first sergeants. In the
end,&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;won the battle of making professional development
available to all senior NCOs. His concern for such enlisted issues as housing,
pay, promotions, education and training, and assignments earned him the respect
of his peers and the nickname,  the GI's man in Washington. 
CMSAF&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;died in 1985.</span></p>

<p><span><br>
9.5.3.4.4&nbsp;<b>CMSAF Thomas N. Barnes:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="162" height="246" src="afh1_files/image214.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.4.1. Thomas N. Barnes grew up in
the war-related industries town of Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1949, he joined
the newly created United States Air Force as an aircraft maintainer
specializing in hydraulics. His first duty station found him at the leading
edge of United States Air Force integration efforts, as one of the first
African-Americans to join the unit. Barnes' unit was flying Korean War support
missions. Unbeknownst to others in his squadron, a crew pal taught him the art
of flight engineering and let him fly resupply and medical evacuation missions.
By his tour's end, Barnes had gained flight engineer certification, accumulated
750 flight hours over enemy territory and earned the Air Medal. He was the
first CMSAF with direct Vietnam experience and the first African-American to
serve in the highest enlisted post of a military service. The Chief of Staff of
the Air Force consecutively extended him in 1975 and in 1976.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.4.2. CMSAF Barnes' notable
contribution came in the area that inspired his greatest passion and ranked
among his largest challenges: working to ensure equality among the ranks and
races. He took great pride in the part he played in bringing about the Air
Force Social Actions Program in 1969. He labored to eliminate barriers for
women and convince the Air Force to use them in nontraditional roles. He
understood the value of continuing to educate Airmen and believed no one should
advance in rank without PME, working to establish the service's firm commitment
to enlisted PME. Recognized throughout the force for his ability to communicate
with anyone, Barnes made listening to Airmen a priority. At the beginning of
his tenure, the question most asked of Barnes was,  What programs will you
implement for the blacks?   The answer was  None ,  Barnes recalls.  I told
them I work for all blue suiters.  After his retirement, Barnes remained
actively engaged in Air Force issues. CMSAF Barnes died in 2003.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.5.<b>&nbsp;CMSAF Robert D.&nbsp;<span>Gaylor</span>:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="161" height="245" src="afh1_files/image215.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.5.1. Growing up in Indiana, Robert
D.&nbsp;<span>Gaylor</span>&nbsp;wanted to travel and learn a
skill. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1948, a transition time for America and
the military. As he arrived at basic training, President Truman issued
Executive Order 9981,&nbsp;<i>Establishing the President's Committee on
Equality of Treatment and Opportunity&nbsp;<span>In</span>&nbsp;the
Armed Forces</i>, calling for equality of opportunity in the United States
military.&nbsp;<span>Gaylor</span>&nbsp;had had no experience with
segregation or integration and he would witness the long journey to full
integration. His first duty was as a military policeman and he excelled
throughout his career, advancing to the rank of Master Sergeant with only 7
years and 7 months of service. Serving as an instructor at basic training and
the NCO Academy convinced him that special duties help prepare NCOs for greater
leadership roles. In 1976, as a member of the Air Force</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Manpower and Personnel Center,&nbsp;<span>Gaylor</span>&nbsp;traveled extensively, giving 275 leadership
talks annually. 9.5.3.4.5.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>CMSAF&nbsp;<span>Gaylor s</span>&nbsp;goal
as the senior enlisted man was to feel the&nbsp;<span>pulse&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>of</span></span><span>&nbsp;the enlisted force and serve as a
conduit of information. He addressed low morale and the weak military public
image head on. He educated the force on the hazards of substance abuse and
continued to raise confidence and shift attitudes within the force. He is
credited with securing a policy that allowed Senior Airman to transport their
families at government expense during permanent change of station moves, a
solid step toward improving quality of life. He educated the force in order to
eliminate the stereotypes and prejudices working against equal opportunities
for minorities and women. Finally,&nbsp;<span>Gaylor</span>&nbsp;promoted
leadership. He traveled extensively, talking to Airmen about taking pride in
their military careers. He believes one of the most important roles a former
CMSAF can play is that of a link between the United States Air Force of the
past and today's service.&nbsp;<span>Gaylor</span>&nbsp;continues
to meet and serve Airmen, conducting more than 40 Air Force base visits each
year.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.6&nbsp;<b>CMSAF
James M. McCoy:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="161" height="245" src="afh1_files/image216.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.6.1. James M. McCoy was raised in
the&nbsp;<span>midwest</span>, attending high school in Atchison,
Kansas, and college at St. Benedicts College in Atchison and St. Ambrose
College in Davenport, Iowa. He seriously considered a vocation in the
priesthood, but in 1951, during the height of the Korean War, he enlisted in
the United States Air Force as a radar operator. When the war ended, the Air
Force had too many operators and needed military training instructors. McCoy
volunteered and, with only 6 years of active duty experience, found himself in
charge of five groups of training instructors. He continued working within the
PME system, serving as NCO preparatory school commandant and as an NCO academy
instructor before returning to the personnel training field in 1973. A year
later he was selected as one of the United States Air Force's 12 Outstanding
Airmen of the Year. He then became Strategic Air Command's first senior
enlisted advisor. While there, McCoy was a member of the Air Force Management
Improvement Group, chaired by CMSAF Barnes, which formed to discuss management
issues and propose solutions. As a result, enlisted PME expanded into five
phases.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.6.2. With the public still
questioning the military involvement in Vietnam, the Air Force was experiencing
the lowest recruiting year ever; retention rates were also dropping when CMSAF
McCoy took office. His first challenge was to improve those numbers. In late
1979, along with former CMSAF&nbsp;<span>Kisling</span>, he
testified before Congress that people were not reenlisting in the Air Force
because they could not make ends meet on enlisted pay. McCoy worked with
recruiters to get the right people in the Air Force and sought to improve the
PME system from basic training to the NCO and senior NCO level. During his tour
as CMSAF, the Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program was instituted to
provide incentive and an alternate promotion option for enlisted members. In
addition to visiting Airmen, he placed great value on being involved with the
Pentagon staff. He expanded the list of boards and conferences where he
believed the CMSAF should have a role. In retirement, McCoy remains at the
forefront of Air Force issues, having served in leadership positions with Air
Force professional organizations and speaking to Airmen throughout the force.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.7.&nbsp;<b>CMSAF
Arthur L. "Bud" Andrews:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="162" height="246" src="afh1_files/image217.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.7.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>In January 1953,
out of a sense of patriotism and a desire to grow and develop, Arthur
"Bud" L. Andrews enlisted in the Air Force. During basic training,
his training instructor asked for volunteers to serve as APs. Thinking AP meant
 air police,  Andrews raised his hand. As it turned out, the training
instructor wanted area policemen. He spent the next 3 months picking up
cigarette butts outside the barracks. He eventually had an opportunity to enter
the military police force, where he served most of the next 14 years. In 1959,
while working as an investigator, Andrews was credited with solving a murder
committed by an Airman Second Class. By 1970, Andrews had served tours in
Morocco, Thailand, and Vietnam; became a first sergeant; and was promoted to
the rank of Senior Master Sergeant. During his career he spent a decade as a
first sergeant.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.7.2. Upon assuming his new
position, CMSAF Andrews' top priority could be described as getting back to
basics. He believed the most vexing problems (such as terms of pay, benefits,
recruitment, and retention) had been addressed and were evolving to meet
Airmen's needs. While he continued to advise the Chief of Staff of the Air
Force on quality-of-life improvements, he began to focus on cultural change. He
felt it was time for Airmen to  think&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<i>me,
me, me</i>.  He wanted people to focus on  how we re supposed to dress, act,
and react toward subordinates and superiors, and how we re supposed to do our
jobs.  He challenged NCOs to  take care of their people and to accomplish the
mission.  He further suggested that NCOs look at themselves if they were
dissatisfied with their jobs. He dispelled the days of  leadership by stress 
and applauded PME for creating a smarter force. Andrews believed the CMSAF
needed to know the issues firsthand, which kept him traveling extensively
around the Air Force. CMSAF Andrews died in 1996.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.8&nbsp;<b>CMSAF
Sam E. Parish:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="160" height="246" src="afh1_files/image218.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.8.1. Sam E. Parish was raised and
educated in north Florida. In 1955, at age 17, he joined the Air Force as a
ground weather equipment operator. His first assignment at Wiesbaden Air Base,
Germany, brought him into an experimental program to cross train as a weather
observer. That experiment led to a career. In 1960, he became the youngest 7-skill
level in his career field and continued to excel. While the chief observer for
the 7th Weather Squadron in Heidelberg, Germany, he was quickly promoted to
Senior Master Sergeant, and at age 31, Parish made Chief Master Sergeant. He
was a member of the first senior NCO academy class, and was selected as the Air
Weather Service Senior Enlisted Advisor in 1973. He returned to Germany in 1976
as the Consolidated Base Personnel Office Personnel Sergeant Major, and in 1977
became the senior enlisted advisor for the United States Air Forces in Europe,
where he established the United States Air Forces in Europe First Sergeant of
the Year program. Parish later served as the 40th Air Division and</span><sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup><span>Strategic Air Command senior enlisted advisor.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.8.2. CMSAF Parish tackled a range
of enlisted personnel issues during his tenure. One such issue was the
fixed-phase point for promotion to Senior Airman, which would promote qualified
Airmen to Senior Airman at a set point in their initial enlistment, allowing them
a chance to be selected for Staff Sergeant during their first enlistment. He
also obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force approval to allow flight line
personnel to wear a functional badge on their uniform, which led to United
States Air Force members in all specialties being able to wear functional
badges identifying their career fields. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the
Air Force approval to establish the John&nbsp;<span>Levitow</span>&nbsp;Award
for each level of PME and to implement the First Sergeant of the Year Program
Air Force-wide. He was known as a straight shooter who did not waste time
trying to figure out what people wanted to hear. Instead, he told them what
they needed to hear. To Parish, the CMSAF is the most important job in the Air
Force from an enlisted program perspective. In retirement, he continues to
support Airmen by attending service functions and visiting bases throughout the
Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.9.&nbsp;<b>CMSAF
James C. Binnicker:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="162" height="246" src="afh1_files/image219.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.9.1. James C. Binnicker, raised in
Aiken, South Carolina, joined the Civil Air Patrol in high school with
aspirations of becoming a pilot. Cadet of the Year honors earned him a
scholarship to attend flight school and the right to represent his state as a
foreign exchange cadet in Great Britain. But, in 1957, doctors detected a high
frequency hearing loss, disqualifying him from the program. To stay close to
his passion, he joined the Air Force in the personal equipment, later called
life support, career field. By 1964, Binnicker cross trained into air
operations, planning flights for missions to Vietnam. While serving in Vietnam
from 1968 to 1969, he served as NCOIC of operations for the 22d Tactical Air
Support Squadron, and later as a Vietnamese-speaking linguist at the Republic
of Vietnam Armed Forces Language School in Saigon. While in Vietnam, he set his
sights on becoming the CMSAF and, as such, being an advocate for enlisted
Airmen. He also served as a first sergeant and base Sergeant Major at Seymour
Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. In 1977, on the recommendation of CMSAF
Thomas Barnes, he became the sole enlisted member of the newly established
President's Commission on Military Compensation. In addition, he spent over 7
years as the senior enlisted advisor for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 12th
Air Force, Pacific Air Forces, and Tactical Air Command.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.9.2. CMSAF Binnicker's first order
of business was tackling the Airman performance report, a system of ratings
from 1 to 9. In an effort to more accurately differentiate between Airmen, the
enlisted performance report was created, along with a system to provide and
document performance feedback. Next, Binnicker set his sights on admitting
Master Sergeants to the senior NCO academy. He believed giving Airmen all the
responsibility they could handle would result in attracting and retaining
higher quality people in the Air Force. He also worked to give minorities and
women more responsibilities throughout the Air Force. The Chief of Staff,
United States Air Force recognized Binnicker as a staunch advocate and
spokesman for enlisted issues. His commitment to Airmen did not change
following his retirement in 1994. He stayed abreast of issues affecting the
enlisted force and visited PME classes to talk with students worldwide. In
addition, he served as president and chief executive officer for the Air Force
Enlisted Village until his death in March 2015.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.10.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Gary
R.&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;played minor league baseball before enlisting in the Air
Force as an aircraft mechanic. During his first assignment as a B-52 crew chief
at Castle Air Force Base, California, he went to work one day with a pack of
cigarettes and $2, and did not return home for 30 days because the Cuban
Missile Crisis sent the base into lockdown. Ten years later,&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;worked
aircraft maintenance in Thailand,&nbsp;reconfiguring&nbsp; B-52s to carry
conventional bombs in what became known as  iron belly  modifications. In 1973,
he returned to the states and spent the next 8 1/2 years as a military training
instructor, and later, chief of the military training division. During an
assignment to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam,&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;broke his
back, was hospitalized for 147 days, and returned to duty as the first
sergeant. Future assignments had&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;taking part in the first
ability to survive and operate exercise in a chemical environment and serving
as a senior enlisted advisor.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.10.2.
CMSAF&nbsp;Pfingston s&nbsp;focus during his tenure was the Air Force drawdown
and budget. Holding the highest enlisted position during Desert Storm, he
worked to restore basic allowance for subsistence to the troops living in field
conditions and increasing the Servicemember's Group Life Insurance, but the
toughest challenge he faced was the Air Force downsizing. To avoid involuntary
separations,&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;worked to implement the Voluntary Separation
Incentive and Special Separation Bonus Programs. His idea to provide career
paths and milestones in line with the officer career model, led to the career
field education and training plan, three-level and seven-level technical
schools for all career fields, and mandatory in-residence PME schools. He also
found himself involved with issues such as homosexuals serving in the military,
Air Force specialty codes opening up to women, assignment policies including
the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus, and even the
introduction of the new senior NCO stripes.&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;remained active
in what he called the  communication chain  of former CMSAFs advocating for the
enlisted force after his retirement. CMSAF&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;died in 2007.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.11.&nbsp;<b>CMSAF David J.&nbsp;Campanale:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="161" height="271" src="afh1_files/image221.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.11.1. Worcester,
Massachusetts, native David J.&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;said he had the world by the
throat after high school. A promising athlete, when a baseball career fell
through, his mother encouraged him to join the Air Force in
1970.&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;completed aircraft maintenance technical school
despite poor study habits and breaking his collarbone playing football. He
credits his supervisors at his first base with turning his attitude
around.&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;sought challenges, volunteering for several tours
to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in support of B-52 Arc Light missions in
Southeast Asia. He later volunteered to transfer to aerial repair. As he rose
through the ranks,&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;earned the distinguished graduate award
at both the NCO academy and senior NCO academy and was stripes for exceptional
performer-promoted to Master Sergeant. He later served as a senior enlisted
advisor, a role called  richly rewarding. </span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.11.2. The year
CMSAF&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;began his tour, the military launched the new TRICARE
health program. The change introduced many questions and a great deal of
anxiety. He led the charge to alleviate those feelings through education. Also,
when Congress threatened to change the retirement system to  High One 
effectively reducing retirement pay,&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;quickly responded.
With senior leader support,&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;stood before Congress in the
successful fight against the proposed change. Another important recruitment and
retention milestone was adoption of the one-plus-one dormitory standard, which
gave each Airman his or her own room. Not a proponent of long speeches, while
visiting bases he encouraged questions rather than delivering a speech, which created
meaningful dialogue. He believes anyone can become CMSAF and offers those who
want to follow in his footsteps this piece of advice: Be honest and keep your
promise.&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;continues to actively mentor Airmen serving today.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.12.&nbsp;<b>CMSAF Eric W.&nbsp;Benken:</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="161" height="246" src="afh1_files/image222.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.12.1. Raised in
Cincinnati, Ohio, after graduating high school Eric W.&nbsp;Benken&nbsp;moved
to Houston, Texas, to join his parents. Struggling to find a good paying job
out of the area, he joined the Air Force as an administrative specialist. Although
first assigned to Ellington Air Force Base, Texas (less than 25 miles from
Houston), he would get his chance to travel 9 months later, on orders to
Ching&nbsp;Chuan&nbsp;Kang Air Base, Taiwan. During his tour, he deployed to
South Vietnam, where he spent his 20th birthday. As the United States Air
Forces Europe senior enlisted advisor, he facilitated the highly
successful&nbsp;beddown&nbsp;of forces during the Bosnia Operation Joint
Endeavor. He led numerous quality-of-life initiatives, including eliminating/remodeling
a third of the United States Air Forces Europe zero-privacy dormitories, making
way for the newly developed one-plus-one dormitories. During his
assignment,&nbsp;Benken&nbsp;crafted the NCO Professional Development Seminar,
an effort to fill the career education void between Airman Leadership School
and the NCO academy.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.12.2. During his
tenure as CMSAF, he focused heavily on fundamental discipline, getting back to
basics, and changing the culture of the Air Force to meet new expeditionary
requirements. He championed Warrior Week at basic training and ensured funding
for a simulated deployed location at&nbsp;Lackland&nbsp;Air Force Base, Texas.
He instituted changes in the First Sergeant Academy curriculum, focusing on
deployment responsibilities. He believed changing the title  senior enlisted
advisor  to  Command Chief Master Sergeant  and adding the star to the chevron
were critical to the success of these positions, in garrison and on the
battlefield. CMSAF&nbsp;Benken&nbsp;engaged Congress and special interest groups
on numerous fronts, ultimately defeating attempts to alter basic military
training gender-integrated training, and reversing the diminished retirement
system of 1986. Other significant challenges included ensuring TRICARE met
health care needs, and modernizing the force with a limited budget. He believed
Air Force leaders should focus on the future and take steps to prepare the
force for the next century.&nbsp;Benken&nbsp;served as the first co-chair of
the Air Force Retiree Council, currently serves on the board of directors for
the Airmen Memorial Foundation and the Mission Readiness Organization Executive
Advisory Council, and continues to speak at a variety of Air Force functions.</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.13.1.
Jim Finch entered the Air Force from East Hampton, New York, expecting to do
only a 4-year hitch. He planned to learn a trade and see what the world had to
offer and move on. Finch spent the early part of his career in the  bomb dumps 
as a missile maintenance crew chief before becoming a PME instructor. After 4
years of teaching, Finch moved to the Leadership and Management Development
Center at Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama. While there, he helped develop a
correspondence version of the NCO preparatory course, and taught new PME
instructors. He was subsequently selected as the Air Force NCO PME functional
manager at the Air Force Military Personnel Center. While there, he was
involved in restructuring the PME program from four to three levels and
implementing procedures to create Airman Leadership School and allow Master
Sergeants to attend the senior NCO academy. Finch later served as an NCO
Academy commandant, the 11th Air Force senior enlisted advisor, and Air Combat
Command, Command Chief Master Sergeant. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.13.2.
When CMSAF Finch took the reins, the Air Force was moving from&nbsp;</span><sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup><sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup><span>a cold war to an
expeditionary mindset. He implemented CMSAF&nbsp;Benken s&nbsp;basic training
Warrior Week vision to help new recruits understand that the expeditionary Air
Force was not a temporary concept. He credits the program's success to the men
and women at&nbsp;Lackland&nbsp;candidates and gave commanders more selection
flexibility. Known as a man of vision, he spent 3 years focusing on enlisted
members' concerns, and implementing programs to improve future preparedness.
Finch recognized that the armed forces had to change to meet changing threats
to national security. He believed future-focused leaders were paramount to
success and made significant contributions to ensure the force developed that
kind of leader. Finch maintains his vision for Airmen by serving on boards of
Air&nbsp;Forceassociated&nbsp;organizations, visiting Air Force members
worldwide, and supporting current CMSAF agendas.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.14.1. Gerald R.
Murray, a native of Boiling Springs, North Carolina, grew up on his
grandfather's farm. Graduating high school in 1974, he briefly attended
college, married his school sweetheart, and worked in textile mills and
construction before entering the Air Force as an F-4 aircraft crew chief in 1977.
Murray's performance and capabilities were quickly recognized by his promotion
to Senior Airman below the zone, and selection as an F-16 aircraft maintenance
instructor. He continued to excel as the senior F-16 crew chief on "Victor
Alert" at&nbsp;Incirlik&nbsp;Air Base, Turkey, and later as an A-10
squadron production superintendent. Deployed in support of Operations Desert
Shield and Desert Storm, he played a key role as the combat turn director at
the most forward operation location in theater, garnering the Bronze Star, and
later the Air Force General Lew Allen Trophy. After standing up a new A-10
squadron at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, Murray's performance and leadership
were recognized again when he was pulled from the flight line to serve as the
347th Wing Senior Enlisted Advisor and Command Chief Master Sergeant. He later
served as the command Chief Master Sergeant at 5th Air Force, United States
Forces Japan, and Pacific Air Forces Command.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.14.2. An
evolving expeditionary air force and a changed world after the 11 September
2001 terrorist attacks were catalysts for change during Murray's tenure. Murray
refocused basic military training and PME toward expeditionary combat
principles and took a leading role in developing a new physical fitness program
to improve Air Force-wide capabilities and readiness. Additionally, Murray led
efforts to balance the enlisted force structure by increasing high-year tenure
for four enlisted grades, bringing back the career job reservation and NCO
retraining programs, and redistributing senior NCO promotions in critical and
unbalanced Air Force specialty codes. Understanding the need to maintain strong
leadership, he initiated a deliberate approach to NCO professional development;
led changes to the management of Chief Master Sergeants, including alignment
under the Air Force Senior Leaders Management Office, and added a Chief Master
Sergeant's leadership course to the enlisted PME continuum. In retirement,
Murray remains active in shaping Airmen development, serving with Air Force
professional organizations and continuing to speak throughout the force.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.15.1. Rodney J.
McKinley grew up in Mt.&nbsp;Orab, Ohio, and originally entered the Air Force
in 1974 as a medical technician. He separated from the Air Force in 1977 to
pursue his education. He returned to active duty in 1982 as an aircraft
maintenance specialist and served in various aircraft maintenance positions at
Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina, and Clark Air Base, Philippines.
In 1991, he became a first sergeant, a position he held for the next 10 years,
with assignments at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South
Carolina;&nbsp;Ghedi&nbsp;Air Base, Italy; Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma; and
Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Chief McKinley then served as a command Chief
Master Sergeant at Ramstein Air Base, Germany; Langley Air Force Base,
Virginia; and 11th Air Force at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. In February
2003, during the early days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, he deployed as Command
Chief Master Sergeant to the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia.
Before being selected as the 15th CMSAF, he was the Pacific Air Forces Command
Chief Master Sergeant at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.15.2. During his
tenure, CMSAF McKinley was an advocate for winning the Global War on Terrorism,
developing and taking care of Airmen, and modernizing aging air, space, and
cyberspace assets. CMSAF McKinley focused on properly organizing, training, and
equipping Airmen during a time when many were being tasked outside their core
competencies. His efforts to improve the enlisted evaluation system resulted in
the first major changes to feedback and performance report forms since 1990.
CMSAF McKinley also advocated for an educated enlisted corps and strongly
encouraged Airmen to pursue their Community College of the Air Force degree
earlier in their careers. A strong advocate for the  American Airman  spirit,
he opened the door for creation of the Airman's Creed, which codified core Air
Force beliefs and articulated the warrior ethos. His vision led to the creation
of the Enlisted Heroes Walk on the parade field at&nbsp;Lackland&nbsp;Air Force
Base, Texas, and the return of the enlisted collar brass and Good Conduct
Medal. CMSAF McKinley also pursued improvements in Airman health and fitness,
wounded warrior care, child care, spousal employment opportunities, and
accompanied and unaccompanied housing.</span></p>

MacDill Air Force Base, Florida;&nbsp;Osan&nbsp;Air Base, Republic of
Korea;&nbsp;Kunsan&nbsp;Air Base, Korea; Andersen Air Force Base, Guam; and Keesler
Air Force Base, Mississippi. He returned to the site of his original technical
training  Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri as an instructor and instructor
supervisor. As a Senior Master Sergeant, he transferred into personnel as the
military personnel flight superintendent, Keesler Air Force Base, in 1999. From
there, Chief Roy served as a Command Chief Master Sergeant at wing, numbered
Air Force, and unified combatant command levels. These assignments included
Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; Charleston Air Force Base South Carolina;
Langley Air Force Base, Virginia; and 5th Air Force and United States Forces
Japan, at Yokota Air Base, Japan. In October 2004, he deployed as the 386th Air
Expeditionary Wing, Southwest Asia Command Chief Master Sergeant. He then
served as the United States Pacific Command senior enlisted leader at Camp H.M.
Smith, Hawaii.</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.16.2. Chief
Roy's key focus areas included ensuring Airmen were ready for joint and
coalition operations; deliberately developing Airmen through education,
training and experience; and building a culture of resiliency within Airmen and
their families. He worked to expand and solidify training and engagement in
joint and coalition environments, which helped enhance the employability of
Airmen in the increasingly joint and coalition warfighting environment. He also
stressed the importance of updating and expanding distance-learning
opportunities, and developed and promoted the Enlisted PME-Next construct,
designed to close the gap in PME following Airman Leadership School.</span></p>

assignments to Travis Air Force Base, California; MacDill Air Force Base,
Florida; 18th Air Force at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, and Air Education
and Training Command at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.5.3.4.17.2.
Immediately upon assuming the position, Chief Cody committed to the continued
evolution of the enlisted force. He identified various policies and processes,
and with the support of the Air Force Chief of Staff and Enlisted Board of
Directors moved each of them forward to ensure the enlisted force was prepared
for future challenges. He focused on the deliberate development of Airmen,
evolving enlisted PME to a blended learning model, and establishing
Developmental Special Duties, which ensured top Airmen were in leadership
positions that best leveraged their proven performance across the force. He
heightened the conversation surrounding work/life balance and the importance of
finding a reasonable and sustainable demand signal for Airmen, and strengthened
care and support programs for Wounded Warriors, including Airmen with invisible
wounds such as TBI and/or PTSD. Additionally, Chief Cody moved the Enlisted
Evaluation System and Weighted Airman Promotion System forward to ensure they
served today's Air Force, and Airmen. He led the biggest changes to both systems
since their inception in 1970, ensuring job performance was the greatest factor
towards promotion.</span></p>

other junior enlisted airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.4. Begin to learn
and demonstrate the institutional and occupational competencies outlined in Air
Force Doctrine Document 1-1,&nbsp;<i>Leadership and Force Development</i>;
AFMAN 36-2647, Table A2.2; and the appropriate Career Field Education and
Training Plan. These competencies are gained through a combination of education
(e.g., PME and academic programs), training (e.g., basic military training and
career development courses, and experience (e.g., primary and special duty and
professional organization participation).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.5. Meet all
pre-deployment and mission requirements and maintain the highest level of
technical readiness. Attain and maintain a skill level commensurate with rank,
as well as a high degree of proficiency in duties outlined in the Career Field
Education and Training Plan.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.6. Increase personal
resilience by understanding and mastering the social, physical, mental and
spiritual domains of comprehensive airmen fitness, and encouraging others to do
the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.6.1. Be mentally
ready to accomplish the mission. Issues that can affect and detract from mental
readiness are quality of life, financial problems, sexual harassment or
assault, discrimination, stress, marital problems and substance abuse. These
issues can prevent Airmen from focusing on the mission, diminish motivation,
erode a positive attitude and reduce work quality. Be aware of warning signs
and seek appropriate assistance through the chain of command, chaplain, medical
community and helping agencies, and help others do the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.6.1.1. Be alert for
signs of depression or suicide. If depressed or suicidal, seek immediate
assistance. Practice and teach the DoD Ask, Care and Escort concept for suicide
prevention. Ask -  Are you thinking about harming yourself or others?  Care

aerobic conditioning, muscular fitness training and healthy eating.</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.6.3. Be socially
ready to accomplish the mission. Build relationships and networks that promote
well-being and optimal performance. Teamwork, communication, connectedness and
social support are key components of social readiness.</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.6.4. Be spiritually
ready to accomplish the mission. Spiritual readiness is the proactive practice
of establishing a sense of purpose or personal priorities to develop the skills
needed in times of stress, hardship and tragedy. Spiritual readiness may or may
not include religious activities.</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.7. Be a
knowledgeable Airman. Stay informed on issues affecting the Air Force using Air
Force media sources (e.g., af.mil and my.af.mil). Ensure no discredit to the
Air Force or compromise of operational security when using personal and
government information systems, including social media.</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.8. Contribute to a
culture and climate of dignity and respect by supporting and enforcing
a&nbsp;zero tolerance&nbsp;policy for sexual harassment, sexual assault, and
discrimination. Know and understand the wingman concept. Airmen take care of
fellow Airmen. A good wingman shares a bond with other Airmen and intervenes to
maintain an environment free of any behaviors that hinder an Airman's ability
to maximize their potential and contribution. Positively support one another,
both on- and off-duty.</span></p>

<p><span>9.6.9. Demonstrate
effective followership by enthusiastically supporting, explaining and promoting
leaders' decisions. Develop innovative ways to improve processes and provide
suggestions up the chain of command that will directly contribute to unit and
mission success. Promote a culture of innovation and continuous process

<p><span>9.6.10. Continue to
pursue personal and professional development through education and involvement.
Promote camaraderie, embrace esprit de corps and act as an Air Force ambassador
(e.g., join professional organizations and/or participate in organization and
community events).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.7. NCO
Responsibilities</span></b><span>. In addition to all
junior enlisted Airmen responsibilities, NCOs must:</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.1. Lead and develop
subordinates and exercise effective followership in mission accomplishment.
NCOs have the authority to issue lawful orders to complete assigned tasks in
accordance with Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.2. Increase
knowledge and understanding of, and mentor junior enlisted airmen on the
institutional and occupational competencies required to accomplish the mission.
These competencies are gained through a combination of education (e.g.,
academic programs and PME), training (e.g., on-the-job training), and
experience (e.g., mentoring and/or participating in professional
organizations).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.3. Increase personal
and&nbsp;subordinates&nbsp;resilience by championing the social, physical,
mental and spiritual domains of comprehensive airman fitness and encouraging
others to do the same.</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.3.1. Champion social
readiness. Develop and lead team-building or networking activities in the unit
and encourage subordinates to participate in outside social engagements.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.3.2. Champion
physical readiness. Lead the way by promoting, supporting, and participating in
unit physical training activities and the Air Force fitness program.
Incorporate physical training into the teams' duty schedules as the mission
allows.</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.3.3. Champion mental
readiness. Be actively aware of issues in subordinates that can impact mental
readiness and mission effectiveness. Address issues negatively impacting mental
readiness, and take positive steps to resolve them in a responsible
manner.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.3.4.
Champion spiritual readiness to help accomplish the mission. Allow for and
encourage subordinates to develop spiritual skills needed in times of stress,
hardship and tragedy. This may or may not include religious activities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.4. Demonstrate and
facilitate a climate of effective followership by willingly owning, explaining
and promoting leaders' decisions. Develop innovative ways to improve processes,
reduce costs and improve efficiency and provide suggestions up the chain of
command that will directly contribute to unit and mission success.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.5. If senior in
grade, accept responsibility for assuming the role of leader. Responsibility
and accountability increase commensurate with grade. Within enlisted grades,
NCOs take rank and precedence over all junior enlisted Airmen and other NCOs
according to rank. Within the same grade, use: date of rank, total active
federal military service date, pay date, and date of birth, in this order, to
determine seniority.&nbsp;<b>NOTE<i>:&nbsp;</i></b>In some circumstances NCOs
who are lower in rank may be placed in charge of other NCOs of the same grade
(i.e., a Technical Sergeant, with a date of rank of 1 Apr 08, is placed in
charge of a fellow Technical Sergeant, with a date of rank of 1 Apr 07). When placed
in charge by commanders, these NCOs have the authority to issue lawful orders
appropriate for mission accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.6. Take an active
leadership and supervisory role by investing in subordinates. Stay
professionally engaged with subordinates on a daily basis both on and
off-duty.&nbsp; Understand a subordinate's environment by visiting living
spaces and installation support facilities (e.g., dining facilities, chapel
centers, recreation centers, dormitories, and enlisted clubs) to be familiar with
off-duty opportunities and living conditions. Mentorship is a critical
component of leadership; NCOs must use professional and personal experiences to
positively mentor others.</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.7. Train and develop
subordinates to ensure they are technically ready to accomplish the mission,
and guide and instruct them to ensure they are prepared to accept increased
levels of authority and responsibility.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.8. Remain keenly
aware of individual and group dynamics affecting readiness and safety. Identify
those exhibiting high-risk behaviors, intervene, and deter further unsafe
practices.</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.9. Appropriately
recognize and reward individuals whose military conduct and duty performance
clearly exceed established standards. Ensure subordinates are held accountable
when they do not meet established standards.</span></p>

<p><span>9.7.10. Provide feedback
and counseling to subordinates on performance, career opportunities,
promotions, benefits, and entitlements. Feedback and counseling are required

<p><b><span>9.12. Airmanship.</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.12.1. Airmanship
Defined. The Army has soldiers. The Navy has sailors. The Marine Corps has marines.
The Air Force has Airmen. From the Airman Basic to the Four-Star General, we in
the Air Force are all Airmen. As Airmen, we are part of a professional
subculture and we demonstrate various disciplines in defense of our Nation
through something we call Airmanship.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Airmanship is the
mindset, evident in our behaviors, that causes us to proudly exhibit the
highest levels of professional service to our country.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span><img border="0" width="273" height="210" src="afh1_files/image229.png" ></span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 9.4. Airmanship</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.12.1.2. What exactly
is this mindset? The dictionary defines mindset as&nbsp;<i> a mental
disposition or attitude that predetermines one's responses and interpretations
of situations</i>.  In the case of Airmanship, that mental disposition or
attitude (mindset) is what we think and how we feel about membership in the
profession of arms, and that mindset is reflected in our behavior. A genuine
belief in the&nbsp;<b>oath of enlistment</b>, an embracement of Air Force&nbsp;<b>core
values</b>&nbsp;as your own, commitment to the&nbsp;<b>profession of arms</b>&nbsp;and
an unstoppable determination known as&nbsp;<b>warrior ethos</b>&nbsp;are the hallmarks
of that mindset. Such a mindset produces pride, selfless service, and care for
our country. This mindset is what we aspire to create and sustain in order to
perpetuate behaviors necessary for mission accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span>9.12.1.3. Our behavior
is a direct result of our mindset (belief, commitment, embracement, and
willingness), and demonstrates our personal commitment to membership in the
profession of arms. Adherence to and enforcement of standards, the willingness
to fulfill all responsibilities, impeccable wear of the uniform, readiness to
perform mission objectives, and perpetuation of the Air Force culture provide a
clear picture of what we expect Airman behavior to look like. (See Figure 9.4).</span></p>

<p><span>9.12.2.&nbsp;<b>Airmen s
Week (Airmanship 100).&nbsp;</b>Airmen's Week is the first phase in CSAF s
larger  Culture of Excellence  initiative; Airmen's week is the first
touch-point in career-long continuum of professionalism development. Airmen s
Week is a stand-alone course that commences immediately following Basic Military
Training (BMT) but before Airmen start technical training. Every Airman
(including Guard &amp; Reserve) graduating from BMT has attended Airmen's week,
which began on 23 Mar 2015.</span></p>

<p><span>9.12.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Mission
and Goals.&nbsp;</b>Airmen's Week equips Airmen to transition from a solid BMT
foundation to the personalization of integrity, service, and excellence. It
enables them to apply our core values to real-world situations and demonstrate
the dignity, respect, and pride that all Airmen should have in themselves and
others. Airmen's Week challenges these Airmen to examine their personal values
and decision-making framework to embrace the Airmen's Creed.&nbsp; The goal is
a more professional, resilient Airman, inspired by our heritage, committed to
the Air Force core values, and motivated to deliver Airpower for America.</span></p>

<p><span>9.12.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Curriculum.&nbsp;</b>Airmen s
Week is a 31-hour course with a curriculum designed to utilize  affective
learning  methods which require Airmen to not only respond to/engage with
material presented, but also demand they make a value judgment on it. This
highly-interactive environment is focused on the application of AF Core Values,
ethical&nbsp;decisionmaking, and  Airmanship .</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.13. We Are All Recruiters (WEAR) and</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Recruiters Assistance Programs (RAP):</b></span></p>

<p><span>9.13.1. The We Are All Recruiters
(WEAR) Program may grant individuals permissive temporary duty status if they
participate in an event that directly enhances the recruiting mission. All
Airmen, regardless of their Air Force specialty, are recruiters. A WEAR event
is an event where the interaction of Air Force personnel educates and increases
public awareness of the Air Force and could potentially provide numerous leads
for recruiters. Approval for WEAR is limited to those events where Airmen are
directly speaking to potential applicants or influencers about Air Force
opportunities. Applicants are defined as individuals within the 17- to
39-year-old range; and influencers are defined as parents, community leaders,
teachers, counselors, coaches, etc. WEAR events are approved on an individual
basis. For those events where multiple Airmen are attending, each attendee must
submit a package for approval. WEAR requests must be first approved by the
individual's commander in accordance with AFI 36-3003,&nbsp;<i>Military Leave
Program.</i>&nbsp;Requests are then routed through Air Force Recruiting
Squadron Public Affairs to the Air Force Recruiting Squadron commander. The Air
Force Recruiting Squadron commander is the approval authority for all WEAR
packages. Members may receive up to 14 days permissive TDY to attend a WEAR
event. For more information, see AFI 36-3003, or visit&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.rs.af.mil/"><span>www.recruiting.af.mil</span></a><a href="http://www.rs.af.mil/"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>and

<p><span>9.13.2.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The Recruiter Assistance Program (RAP) is an active-duty leave
program, run by the Air Force Recruiting Service, where an Airman directly
supports an Air Force recruiter. The Air Forces grants up to 12 days of
nonchargeable leave, including one weekend, in accordance with AFI
36-3003,&nbsp;<i>Military Leave Program</i>. RAP is open to Airmen of all ranks
interested in participating and having a positive impact on recruiting. RAP is
beneficial to the Air Force and to participants because Airmen can be a major
influence in bringing the Air Force story to their hometown or place of
previous residence by helping recruiters make contacts and develop leads. RAP
duties may include participation in question-and-answer sessions, making
presentations, or providing testimonials of their Air Force experiences to high

<p><b><span>9.14. United States Air Force Enlisted
Professional Military Education.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force enlisted PME
compliments training, experience, and other educational programs to provide
enlisted leaders a continuum of learning via progressive courses concentrated
on developing leadership, Airmanship and military professionalism. Enlisted PME
courses provide professional education to enlisted Airmen at specific and
critical career points, and thus play a vital role in preparing them for
increased supervision, leadership, and management challenges. More
specifically, enlisted PME develops Air Force institutional competencies
and&nbsp;subcompetencies&nbsp;vital to the knowledge and skills required for
critical thinking, sound decision making and strategic thinking to provide the
Air Force with agile combat support. More than 67,000 enlisted Airmen complete
enlisted PME courses each year. For more information about Air Force enlisted
PME programs and policies, see AFI 36-2301,&nbsp;<i>Developmental Education</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Mission
and Vision.</b></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>The academic affairs mission is to educate
enlisted Airmen to accomplish the Air Force mission. The academic affairs
vision is educational excellence for Airmen developing enlisted airpower
leaders for America.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Curriculum.&nbsp;</b>Enlisted
PME academic affairs provides comprehensive programs (curricula, evaluation,
analysis, instructor development) for each level of enlisted PME. These
programs consist of thorough and rigorous academic courses that use performance
evaluations and objective examinations to determine how well students achieve
instructional objectives. For the NCO Intermediate Leadership Experience<b>&nbsp;</b>and
senior NCO Advanced Leadership Experience, the principle instructional methods
include experiential activities, problem-centered leadership laboratories,
personal reflection, guided discussion, case study analysis, and writing
assignments.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Academic
Credit.&nbsp;</b>Airmen receive academic credit for completing enlisted PME
courses through the Community College of the Air Force, which is accredited
through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Enlisted PME schools
provide the Community College of the Air Force with class graduate data, and
the Community College of the Air Force automatically updates individual records
and transcripts with academic credits.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.<b>&nbsp;Enlisted PME Resident Courses:</b></span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Airman
Leadership School.&nbsp;</b>The Airman Leadership School is the first level of
enlisted PME that enlisted Airmen complete as they progress through their Air
Force careers. On 1 October 1991, Air University established a standardized
Airman Leadership School program that replaced the NCO Preparatory Course and
the NCO Leadership School. Airman Leadership Schools operate at almost every
installation across the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Mission.&nbsp;</b>The
Airman Leadership School mission is to prepare Senior Airmen to be
professional, warfighting Airmen able to supervise and lead Air Force teams to
support the employment of air, space, and cyberspace power.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Curriculum.&nbsp;</b>Airman
Leadership School is a 192-hour course with a curriculum designed to develop a
mindset and associated skills to meet four core graduate attributes: (1)
Expeditionary Airman, (2) Supervisor of Airmen, (3) Professional Airman, and
(4) Supervisory Communicator. Currently, Airman Leadership School graduates
earn 9 semester hours of college credit with Community College of the Air
Force.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.2.<b>&nbsp;NCO
Academy.&nbsp;</b>In 1955, Leadership Schools were established across the Air
Force to provide noncommissioned officers leadership and management training
required to assume day-to-day mission execution responsibilities. The stand-up
of these Leadership Schools (which later became NCO Academies) coincided with
the release of the first Enlisted Force Structure which established the
leadership roles and responsibilities of enlisted Airmen at each grade.<b>&nbsp;</b>In
November 1993, operational control of stateside NCO Academies transferred from
the various major commands to Air Education and Training Command. Air Education
and Training Command assigned all stateside NCO Academies to the College for
enlisted PME (now the Barnes Center for Enlisted Education). In addition to the
five Barnes Center-operated academies located at&nbsp;Lackland, Sheppard,
Tyndall, Keesler and Peterson Air Force Bases; the Air National Guard operates
one NCO academy at McGhee-Tyson Air Force Base; Pacific Air Force Command
operates three at Hickam,&nbsp;Kadena&nbsp;and Elmendorf Air Force Bases; and
United States Air Forces in Europe operates one at&nbsp;Kapaun&nbsp;Air
Station.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Mission.&nbsp;</b>The
NCO academy mission is to prepare junior enlisted leaders to be adaptable for
current and future leadership and management challenges in order to operate
[think/act] critically in complex and ambiguous environments. NCOs must
successfully complete the NCO academy Distance Learning Course and meet
attendance requirements published in AFI 36-2301,&nbsp;<i>Developmental
Education</i>&nbsp;in order to attend the Intermediate Leadership Experience.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Curriculum.&nbsp;</b>The
NCO academy program encompasses the NCO academy Intermediate Leadership
Experience (ILE). ILE represents comprehensive junior NCO institutional
competency development and further develops the knowledge gained from the
distance learning course. The ILE is 198-hour course that includes guided
discussion classroom methodology, experiential exercises, case study analysis,
and immersive leadership development laboratories designed to improve an NCOs
competence, confidence and will to exercise assigned leadership
responsibilities.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.3.<b>&nbsp;Air
Force Senior NCO Academy.&nbsp;</b>The Air Force established the Air Force
Senior NCO academy in 1972 to enhance development of senior NCOs through PME.
In January 1973, the Air Force Senior NCO Academy conducted their first class
of 120 senior NCOs at Maxwell Air Force Base-Gunter Annex Alabama. Presently,
the Air Force Senior NCO academy trains up to 2,250 Air Force senior NCOs,
(Senior Master Sergeants, Senior Master Sergeant selects, and selected Master
Sergeants), Navy and Coast Guard chief petty officers, Marine Gunnery Sergeants
and above, and international senior NCOs annually. Senior NCOs successfully
complete the senior NCO distance learning course and meet attendance
requirements published in AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education in order to
attend the Air Force Senior NCO Academy Advanced Leadership Experience.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Mission.&nbsp;</b>The
Air Force Senior NCO academy mission is to develop joint and coalition senior
enlisted leaders to influence mission success in dynamic service
environments.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Curriculum.&nbsp;</b>The
Air Force Senior NCO Academy program encompasses the Senior NCO academy
Advanced Leadership Experience (ALE). ALE represents comprehensive
institutional competency development and further develops the knowledge gained
from the current Senior NCO distance learning course. The Air Force Senior NCO
Academy delivers the 200-hour ALE honing senior enlisted leader skills with
education that helps prepare them to be adaptable, critically thinking, and
strategically relevant in their operating environment. Successful students are
able to apply their understanding of concepts covered in the prerequisite
distance learning course as well as additional concepts instructed during the
ALE. ALE prepares senior NCOs for increased leadership responsibility in the
joint, combined, and interagency operating and strategic environment.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Chief
Master Sergeant Leadership Course.&nbsp;</b>The Chief Master Leadership Course
(CLC), located on Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, Alabama, is the capstone and
pinnacle level of enlisted professional military education. The CLC was first
launched in 2004 as an 8-day resident course taught at the Air Force Senior NCO
Academy. The course was suspended in 2011 and re-established in 2013 as a
33-week facilitated distance learning course which started on 16 November 2013
and ended 12 September 2014. Currently, the CLC provides new Chief Master
Sergeants with foundational, strategic-level leadership competencies invaluable
to fly, fight, and win in the employment of air, space, and cyberspace. The CLC
conducts seven classes per year, educating 750 total force Chief Master
Sergeants annually. The CLC is designed for students selected for promotion to
Chief Master Sergeant. The expected learning outcomes for the course are to
provide Chief Master Sergeants a broad perspective of the Air Force mission as
it relates to national security established by our nation's senior leaders to
all levels of Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Mission.&nbsp;</b>The
CLC mission is to provide Chief Master Sergeants the education to bridge
operational-tostrategic&nbsp;perspectives of the Air Force. The CLC vision is
to develop Chief Master Sergeants into strategic level leaders and to inspire
them to effectively lead, manage and mentor today's Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>9.14.2.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Curriculum.</b>&nbsp;The
course consists of five modules: Educational Theories, National Security,
Strategic Leadership, Synchronized Engagement, and Integrated Development. The
CLC is a 20-day residence course, preceded by a 15-day, self-paced,
non-facilitated, distance learning lesson. The CLC demands extensive
self-study, critical creative thinking, communication, and interpersonal
skills.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 9D Military
Ethics</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>9.16. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military ethics is about
each Airman doing what is right and just for our country, Air Force, and unit.
Our Air Force, driven towards excellence by competence and character, is built
upon thousands of good Americans that have volunteered to defend our country.
These Airman realize truth and integrity are more than buzz words; those words
are the focal point of our moral compass. As General John D. Ryan, the 16th Air
Force Chief of Staff, said "any order to compromise integrity is not a
lawful order." Airmen must have the courage to be the type of people we
ought to be. Ethical Airmen are not focused on personal successes or virtues.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.1. As an Airman
serving proudly in the Profession of Arms, you definitely know the difference
between right and wrong. The Air Force provides guiding rules and standards
through an ethical code. An ethical code guides us in our daily decision
making. Our ethical code is prescribed throughout our Air Force Core Values,
Oath of Enlistment, Oath of Office, Air Force Instructions, and the Uniform
Code of Military Justice. You ll be faced with decisions. Some decisions you
will have to make. Other decisions you will help your wingmen make. These
decisions might be related to your mission, your personal life, or the interest
of your peers. The choice you make can be successful when you re utilizing
sound ethical principles.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.1.1. Sound ethical
principles are rooted in our Air Force Core Values. Our core values of
Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence&nbsp;In&nbsp;All We Do
clearly define our identity. Every Airman learns to cherish our core values
when they enter our profession. They begin by reading the core values, then
understanding the core values, and finally living the core values. Expanding
upon our core values lead us to virtues we must practice and demonstrate in our
lives.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.1.2. Integrity
First is a character trait and the willingness to do what is right even when no
one is looking.&nbsp; Integrity is your moral compass and inner voice of
self-control. The virtues of honesty, courage, and accountability stem from
Integrity First. Honesty means our words must be unquestionable so we preserve
the trust that unites us through common goal and purpose. Courage is about
doing the right thing despite fear and empowers us to make ourselves better. Accountability
instills our responsibility while maintaining transparency and ownership for
our actions.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.1.3. Service Before
Self tells us professional duties take precedence over personal desires. The
virtues of duty, loyalty, and respect blossom from Service Before Self. Duty is
our obligation to perform what is required for the mission; sometimes having to
make sacrifices in ways that no other profession has or will. Loyalty is our
internal commitment to the success and preservation of something bigger than
ourselves, ordered as country, Air Force, and unit. Respect requires us to
treat each other with dignity and value them as individuals, knowing all Airmen
possess fundamental worth as human beings.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.1.4.
Excellence&nbsp;In&nbsp;All We Do directs us to develop a sustained passion for
the continuous improvement and innovation that propels the Air Force, as well
as ourselves, beyond the capabilities of our adversaries. The virtues of
mission, discipline, and teamwork are the cornerstone of Excellence&nbsp;In&nbsp;All
We Do. Mission encompasses operations, product, and resource excellence; must
accomplish our duties correctly while practicing fiscal responsibility.
Discipline is an individual commitment to uphold the highest standards of personal
and professional conduct, which we demonstrate with attitude, work ethic, and
continuous improvement. Required is teamwork at every level to complete the
mission and we must recognize the interdependency of each Airmen's contribution
toward the mission and strive for organizational excellence.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.1.5. An ethical
dilemma is a situation where one is forced to choose between at least two
alternatives. Three general causes of ethical dilemmas are uncertainty,
competing values, and potential harm. Uncertainty is the result of not having
all the facts pertaining to the situation, having no experience dealing with
the situation, or not having a clearly established policy, procedure, or rule
for deciding how to choose. Competing values occur when our personal values conflict
with those of our institution, subordinates, peers, or supervisors; however,
the mark of a true professional is maintaining high professional standards
despite conflicting values. Potential harm relates to the intentional and
unintentional consequences caused by your actions; you should always think
through second and third order consequences of your actions. When facing an
ethical dilemma, Dr. James H. Toner provides us the framework of ethical
principles for decision making.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.2. According to Dr.
James H. Toner, former Professor of International Relations and Military
Ethics, Air War College, military ethics is rooted in the three&nbsp;Os:&nbsp;<i>owing,</i>&nbsp;<i>ordering</i>,
and&nbsp;<i>oughting</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.2.1. Military
ethics cannot properly exist without the concept of owing. If we, as Airmen,
know who and why we owe, we are able to recognize the obligation,
responsibility, and duty which give rise to moral thinking and ethical
reasoning. Airmen must understand they owe a debt of gratitude to our country,
family, service, chain of command, and comrades. Additionally, from the
pioneers of aviation to the selfless sacrifice of battlefield Airmen, we owe to
those who came before us and those we serve with today to strive for
 excellence in all we do .&nbsp; Furthermore, this is a reflection of the core
value  service before self  as identified in the Airman's Creed:&nbsp;<i>I am
faithful to a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and a legacy of valor</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.2.2. The second O
is for ordering, or what Dr. Toner calls moral structuring and ethical priorities.
In other words, are you putting your priorities in the right order? Many
illegal activities or easily prevented mistakes are the result of a leader s
failure to order<i>&nbsp;</i>wisely and well. As defenders of freedom and
justice, we take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, and
to obey the President and the officers appointed over us, in that order. As
Airmen, our highest priority is to serve our country. We can never sacrifice
the good of our nation for the good of our service, our superiors, or
ourselves. According to Dr. Toner, the proper ordering of our priorities should
be country, Air Force, and then unit. Dr. Toner explains that to understand
this concept, look at the service tape on your uniform and notice the United
States always comes before Air Force. We pronounce the same when we recite our
Airman's Creed:&nbsp;<i>I am an American Airman, I am a warrior, I have
answered my nation's call.</i></span></p>

<p><span>9.16.2.3. The final
O,&nbsp;oughting, is the understanding of what Airmen ought to do every day.
What Airmen do may not be what they ought to do and this may sound simple, but
military hierarchies insist upon obedience to orders and total discipline.
Ethics, however, objects to this, insisting upon conditional and contextual
obedience to orders, which ought to be obeyed, if lawful. The&nbsp;<i>Manual
for Courts-Martial</i>, Rule 916, states  It is a defense to any offense that
the accused was acting pursuant to orders unless the accused knew the orders to
be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known
the orders to be unlawful.  Our core values help guide us in the direction of
what we ought to do.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.3. To support our
concept of ordering, we are introduced to the three Ps:&nbsp;<i>principle</i>,&nbsp;<i>purpose</i>,
and&nbsp;<i>people</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.3.1. Our principle, which is truth telling
and honorable service, is always first. Truth telling goes hand in hand with
our core value of  integrity first , which is the foundation of trust. Trust
unites us as Airmen and permits you to grow a strong wingman bond. Honorable
service is detailed in the Code of Conduct, which in and of itself is an
ethical guide. Just ask Captain Scott F. O Grady, who was shot down behind
enemy lines.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.3.2.
Our purpose as Airmen, clearly defined as mission accomplishment and duty, is
why our service exists.&nbsp; From hot air balloons to wooden propellers to
turbofan engines, Airmen have risen to the challenge at hand. We are the
Tuskegee Airmen that never let an escorted bomber get shot down. We are the
liberators of the oppressed as evidenced in Operation Desert Storm. We are the
future of advanced warfare which we proudly proclaim in the Airman's Creed:<i>&nbsp;I
am an American,&nbsp;My&nbsp;mission is to fly, fight, and win.</i></span></p>

<p><span>9.16.3.3.
Our people make all of this possible. Just look to the walls of the Enlisted
Heritage Research Institute to see this is true. Staff Sergeant William
H.&nbsp;Pitsenbarger&nbsp;gave his life aiding and defending a unit of soldiers
pinned down by an enemy assault. Sergeant John L.&nbsp;Levitow&nbsp;disregarded
his own wounds and saved the lives of his entire crew. Senior Airman Jason D.
Cunningham gave his life so that others may live. Airman First Class Elizabeth
N. Jacobson made the ultimate sacrifice while guarding a convoy of American
service men and women. These heroic Airmen personified this passage from the
Airman's Creed:&nbsp;<i>I am an American Airman, guardian of freedom and
justice, my nation's sword and shield, its sentry and avenger, I defend my
country with my life.</i></span></p>

<p><span>9.16.4. To assist our
decision making, we incorporate the three&nbsp;Rs:&nbsp;<i>rules</i>,<i>&nbsp;results</i>,
and&nbsp;<i>realities</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.4.1.
First, obey the rules because the rules are the accepted moral norms. However,
we can t create rules for every possible situation. When facing an ethical
dilemma and asking yourself  What ought I do?  reflect on the core values to
idealize the person we want to be and the example we want to set.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.4.2.
Additionally, results are the goals of country, Air Force, and unit and our
responsibility as Airmen is to accomplish the mission. However, in the climate
of decentralized execution, our responsibility is to figure out how to
accomplish the mission. Do not make decisions based on self-interests.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.4.3.
Finally, realities are inputs that effect our decision-making. We must use our
self-awareness to realize who we are and what we do; because, what we do is who
we are and who we are is what we do. If your moral compass needs calibration,
your decision will not direct you on the right path. When your moral compass is
well maintained, you will guide your country, Air Force, and unit upon a
righteous path.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.5. To put the
three&nbsp;Os&nbsp;into action, we utilize the three Ds:&nbsp;<i>discern</i>,&nbsp;<i>declare</i>,
and&nbsp;<i>do</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.5.1. We must
discern, or recognize, the correct path to lead our Airmen on. Attentive
wingmen utilize critical thinking to discern. Remember to properly&nbsp;<i>order</i>&nbsp;your
thinking.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.5.2. We must
declare the correct path as we have discerned the correct path. Effective
leaders educate and promote the growth of their team. Your inclusion of team
members will enhance the change process.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.5.3.
Then we must do what we have discerned and declared. Spirited warriors
accomplish the mission. We speak these truths when reciting the Airman s
Creed:&nbsp;<i>I am an American Airman, wingman, leader, warrior, I will never
leave an Airman behind, I will never falter, and I will not fail.</i></span></p>

<p><span>9.16.6.
As Airmen, we owe those who wore the uniform before us. We are free today
because others sacrificed their time, effort, and lives to make our country
what our country is, and we must continue the fight to ensure our country stays
strong and secure. We must also order<i>&nbsp;</i>our priorities so we are able
to overcome any temptation to stray from our military norms and values.
Finally, we should always do what we ought<i>&nbsp;</i>to do.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.6.1.
When contemplating what to do, considering your possible courses of action is
important. By listing your possible decisions that could correct the situation,
you can quality check your ideas to take the most moral path. Put each of your
courses of action to the test. Dr. Robert M. Hicks, former Deputy Director of
the Civil Air Patrol, Chaplain Services, identified three tests we can use to
check the morality of our actions.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.6.2.
The network test consists of asking yourself,  How would this decision look
when aired on the news?  If your actions were broadcast on the evening news,
would you be proud of your actions or ashamed of your actions?&nbsp; Would your
actions discredit yourself or those we owe? If you find the answer to be the
latter, then your decision doesn t pass the network test.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.6.3.
The United States of America test focuses on asking yourself,  Is this decision
good for America? Is this decision good for the United States Air Force? Is
this decision good for my unit? Is this decision good for me?  If you take this
course of action, are you properly ordering your priorities? Would your actions
promote the virtues of Service Before Self (duty, loyalty, and respect)? If you
can t answer this with a resounding yes, this might not be the best decision.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.6.4.
The divine test deals with asking yourself,  Would I feel good about the
decision when I give account for my life?  When telling the story of your proud
and honorable service to our country, would you include conversation about this
decision? Would you feel guilt or loss of trust from this action? If you can t
answer this with a positive input, the course of action fails the divine test.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.6.5.
Utilizing the information provided to you should provide you with a clear path
of understanding on how to make ethical decisions. What is important to keep
your focus on are two main areas of honorable service: your commitment to the
Profession of Arms and your ability to make ethical choices. You can build your
own ethical knowledge while fostering that of your peers. Remind yourself and
your peers of the reason you do what you do, as found in the Oath of Enlistment
or Oath of Office. Declare the importance of adhering to established ethical
codes, relying on them when faced with a choice between right and wrong. Use
Dr. Toner's model and Dr. Hicks' three tests when making ethical choices.</span></p>

<p><span>9.16.7. Military ethics
is not about others, but is about&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;knowing what is true and
doing what is right; about being the man or woman who leads the kind of
life&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;can be proud of.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 9E Enlisted
Force Development</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>9.17. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Enlisted
Force Development is a life-cycle approach to developing innovative Airmen
prepared to accomplish the Air Force mission and lead in a rapidly evolving
global environment while attempting to meet both personal and professional
needs. Deliberate development is essential throughout an Airman's career and
satisfied through education on institutional competencies, training on
functional competencies, a varied array of experiential opportunities, and
force developmental tools. When developing Airmen, what is essential is to
ensure they take full advantage of the abundant opportunities and resources
that exist both functionally and institutionally. What is imperative from an
enterprise perspective, is to look at how Airmen progress through their career
fields and then into operational and strategic leadership positions.</span></p>

<p><span>9.17.1.
Functionally, the Air Force develops technical experts through career field
progression and succession planning. From the earliest stages of their careers,
Airmen and their supervisors must comprehend the progression path for technical
and professional development. In the majority of career fields, the progression
roadmap and developmental pyramid provide sufficient direction to produce
Airmen qualified for their current duties and for future responsibilities.
Incumbent upon Career Field Managers is to routinely review their progression
strategy to ensure their career field's technical requirements are being
satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span>9.17.2.
Institutionally, we strive to develop experienced leaders. As Airmen
demonstrate expertise and potential, they should be encouraged to take on more
responsibility and increased leadership roles. Developmental opportunities such
as deployments, joint assignments and headquarters staff assignments offer a
unique perspective on how the Air Force functions. Furthermore, special duty
assignments provide skills and insight beneficial to an Airman's future
capabilities.</span></p>

<p><span>9.17.3.
Additionally, educational opportunities exist throughout an Airman's career
which contribute to individual overall development. Enlisted Professional
Military Education, developmental education, civilian education and
other&nbsp;selfimprovement&nbsp;programs such as the United States Air Force
Library Digital Media Program and Air Force Credentialing Opportunities On-Line
enhance the knowledge and capabilities of Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>9.17.4.
Effective career progression and Airman Development are dependent upon frank
conversations between supervisors and subordinates regarding career field and
institutional requirements, personal qualifications and goals, and available
developmental opportunities. Routine counseling and performance feedback
sessions should include these discussions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.18. Enlisted Force Development Oversight:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.18.1.<b>&nbsp;The Enlisted Force Development
Panel.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
Enlisted Force Development Panel is responsible for guiding enlisted force
development initiatives. The Enlisted Force Development Panel is charged to
review, evaluate, and make recommendations to senior Air Force leaders
regarding concerns, programs and initiatives relating to the education,
training and experiences impacting enlisted Airman Development. The Enlisted
Force Development Panel is hosted by the Chief, Enlisted Force Development and
co-chaired by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force and the Director,
Force Development (Air Force/A1D). Panel members include Command Chief Master
Sergeants from the combatant command and major command level as well as from
the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard. Additionally, there
are Career Field Managers and representatives from Air Education Training
Command, Air University, Second Air Force, Basic Military Training, Air Force
Personnel Center and Headquarters Air Force. A former Chief Master Sergeant of
the Air Force attends as a strategic advisor.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.19. Enlisted Force Development Tools.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In
2010, the Enlisted Force Development Panel recommended initiating Enlisted
Development Teams to enable the enlisted force to deliberately develop senior
enlisted leaders. According to Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force James A.
Roy, "The purpose of deliberate development is to grow our senior
noncommissioned officers and grow the next generation of senior enlisted
leaders to meet the highly technical and very complex leadership challenges the
Department of Defense and the United States Air Force face in the future."</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>In 2011, pilot Enlisted Development Teams were established in
eight career fields, focusing on specialties associated with the nuclear
enterprise. In 2012, Air Force/A1 and the Vice Chief of Staff approved Enlisted
Development Teams for all Air Force specialty codes, with execution across the
enlisted force expected to be complete by 2017. Enlisted Development Teams are
designed to leverage the development of qualified Airmen with the leadership
capacity and acculturation necessary to support current and projected mission
requirements. Career Field Managers use Enlisted Development Teams to perform
progression and succession planning to place Airmen in key leadership and
developmental positions based on defined education, training, experience and
performance requirements. Placing  the right people in the right place at the
right time  is imperative.</span></p>

<p><span>9.19.1.<b>&nbsp;MyVECTOR.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Formerly
known as the Career Path Tool,&nbsp;MyVECTOR&nbsp;is a Total Force, force
development, experience tracking, enterprise solution that supports the
Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Air Force development
priorities.&nbsp;MyVECTOR&nbsp;is a web-based career planning and force
development tool which allows individuals greater transparency into their
development and career management. In addition to being the enterprise
information technology tool used to support Career Field Managers and
development teams,&nbsp;MyVECTOR&nbsp;also offers robust mentoring
capabilities. The reconfigured online platform has a modern look and feel, with
the new configuration supporting not only the traditional by-name request
method of requesting a mentor, but also providing
a&nbsp;mentormatching&nbsp;capability based on weighted characteristics
identified by the Airman searching for a mentor.&nbsp;MyVECTOR&nbsp;also has a
real-time Mentoring Plan, discussion forums, a bullet tracker to document
accomplishments, and the ability to dialogue on-line with your mentor. A
resource page is also available to assist both parties with mentoring questions
and relationships.</span></p>

<p><span>9.19.2.<b>&nbsp;Enlisted Career Path Pyramid.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Enlisted Career Pyramid (Figure 9.5) is a
display of training, education, and experience which enlisted Airmen will
encounter throughout their career. This career path pyramid provides Airmen
with an understanding of current and future opportunities for continuing
development.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.20. Institutional Competencies.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Institutional
competencies prepare Airmen to operate successfully across the widest array of
Air Force tasks and requirements. These competencies provide a common language
and a set of priorities for consistency across the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>The
Air&nbsp;Force's institutional competencies are key to ensuring the ability of
Airmen to operate successfully in a constantly changing operational
environment. They are broadly applicable and span all occupations, functions,
and organizational levels. These competencies place the institutional
responsibilities into a context of how the individual should be developed and
form the framework for force development in the Air Force. The institutional
competency list consists of 8 competencies and 25 sub-competencies. They are
grouped into three categories: personal, people/team, and organizational.
9.20.1.<b>&nbsp;Personal Competencies.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Personal
competencies (Figure 9.6) are those institutional competencies leaders need in
face-to-face and interpersonal relationships that directly influence human
behavior and values. These are foundational institutional competencies learned
at the tactical level that will continue to play a critical role as leaders
move to the operational competence and strategic vision levels. Personal
competencies are essential for individual contribution, for building cohesive
units and for empowering immediate subordinates. Each competency below is
followed by the relevant&nbsp;subcompetencies&nbsp;with definitions.</span></p>

<p><span>9.20.3.&nbsp;<b>Organizational Competencies.</b></span></p>

<p><span>These
competencies (Figure 9.8) represent those applicable at all levels of the Air
Force but are most in demand at the strategic level. Strategic leaders apply
organizational competencies to establish structure and articulate strategic
vision. Effective organizational competency skills include technical competence
on force structure and integration; on unified, joint, multinational, and
interagency operations; on resource allocation; and on management of complex
systems. In addition, they apply to conceptual competence in creating policy
and vision and interpersonal skills emphasizing consensus building and
influencing peers and other policy makers, both internal and external to the
organization. This level is the nexus of warfighting leadership skills for the
Air Force. Also, this level is achieved through having learned the lessons from
the other types of institutional competencies (i.e., personal and people/team).

<p><b><i><span>Section 9F The
Profession of Arms: An Airman's Perspective</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>9.21. America's Guardians:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.21.1.
Since the Nation's birth, our military has had the constitutional duty to
ensure national survival, defend lives and property, and promote vital interest
at home and abroad. To provide for the common defense, all of America s
military services strive for excellence in how they organize, train, and equip
their forces to fight and win the Nation's wars. All are vital, interdependent
components of a mighty joint team, united by a tradition of honor, valor, and
devotion.</span></p>

<p><span>9.21.2.
The Air Force exists to fly, fight, and win to achieve strategic, operational,
and tactical objectives unhindered by time, distance, or geography. The Air
Force's mission is to  deliver sovereign options for the defense of the United
States of America and global interests<b> </b>to fly and fight in Air, Space,
and Cyberspace.  Thereby, jointly with our brothers and sisters in
arms Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen we underwrite the strategy
of defending the homeland and assuring allies, while dissuading, deterring, and
defeating enemies.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.22. Professionalism or Profession of Arms.</span></b></p>

<p><span>No profession asks more
of their members than the Profession of Arms. We are warriors, we have answered
our Nation's call; no one puts more on the line to defend freedom than the men
and women of the United States Armed Forces.</span></p>

<p><i><span>As members of the joint team, we Airmen are part of a unique
profession that is founded on the premise of service before self. We are not
engaged in just another job; we are practitioners of the profession of arms. We
are entrusted with the security of our Nation, the protection of our citizens,
and the preservation of its way of life. In this capacity, we serve as
guardians of America's future. By its very nature, this responsibility requires
us to place the needs of our service and our country before personal concerns.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span>Our military profession is sharply distinguished from others by
what General Sir John Hackett has termed the  unlimited liability clause.  Upon
entering the Air Force, we accept a sacred trust from the American people.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span>We swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United
States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We take this obligation
freely without any reservations. We thereby commit our lives in defense of
America and her citizens should that become necessary.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span>No other profession readily expects its members to lay down their
lives for their friends, families, or freedoms. But our profession readily
expects its members to willingly risk their lives in performing their
professional duties. By voluntarily serving in the military profession, we accept
unique responsibilities.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p><i><span>Inherent in all this is the individual's willingness to
subordinate personal interests for the good of one's unit, one's Service, and
one's Nation. We can ill afford individuals who become  sunshine soldiers' or
get focused on careerism. Instead, we need professionals who strive to be the
best at their current job and who realize they attain individual advancement
through the success of their unit or work center.</span></i></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>General Ronald R.&nbsp;Fogleman</span></p>

<p><span>Former Air Force Chief of Staff</span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><b><span>9.23. The Airman's Perspective:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.23.1.
Throughout our history, the Air Force has always had a perspective or mindset
different than the surface components of national military power, and this is
based on a long history of lessons learned in peace and war. Specifically,
airpower in application is fundamentally different from other forms of military
power. Second, inherent flexibility allows the force to be applied
independently or in concert with other forms of military power. Third, can be
most effective if applied for the right reasons and in the right concentrations
at the right time and place to achieve effects on the battlefield. Therefore,
since Air Force forces are employed differently, in different mediums, at
different speeds and closure rates and over greater distances. These forces
must be applied by those who truly appreciate the breadth and scope in the
application of that power. Finally, Airman should have fluent knowledge of
these aspects of Air Force capabilities.</span></p>

<p><span>9.23.2.
Airmen are essential to the Air Force institution and the successful execution
of their mission. To understand and actively advocate the Airman's perspective
on the use of airpower to achieve objectives as directed by proper authority is
important. All Airmen share the same goal to accomplish their organization s
mission. In order to defend the United States and global interests, Airmen
should be prepared to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace. Using the
Airman's perspective gives Airmen a distinctive advantage when performing this
mission of the Air Force. Airmen bring not only knowledge, skills, and
abilities that allow them to accomplish this mission, but a manner of
approaching mission accomplishment unique to those educated, trained, and
experienced in bringing&nbsp;airmindedness&nbsp;to all actions they perform. An
Airman brings a perspective to performing the Service's mission that compounds
his or her effectiveness in a manner best suited to support a commander.</span></p>

<p><span>9.23.3.
Upon entering the Air Force, members take an oath signifying their personal
commitment to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and a
commitment and willingness to serve their country for the duration of their Air
Force career. The oath is a solemn promise to do one's duty and meet one's responsibilities.
The oath espouses the responsibility to lead others in the exercise of one s
duty.</span></p>

<p><span>9.23.4.
Building warrior leaders who have the competencies and skills to understand the
complexity of expeditionary operations and the successful execution of airpower
capabilities in unilateral, joint, or coalition operations is a responsibility
shared by the Air Force and individual Airmen. Also, Airmen must be able to use
scarce resources effectively to deliver required air, space, and cyberspace
effects. The development of this warrior ethos is an individual and
organizational responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span>9.23.5.
When Air Force forces are employed in various operational environments, they
offer basic characteristics that, when exploited, are fundamental to the
successful conduct of war and peace. These characteristics, when molded into
viable force capabilities and executed by knowledge-enabled Airmen, enhance the
overall ability of the joint team to achieve success when called upon.
Therefore, each Airman should understand and be able to articulate the full
potential and application of Air Force capabilities required to support the Air
Force mission and meet United States national security objectives.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.24. The Warrior Ethos:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.24.1.
The central focus of the profession of arms is warfighting. As Airmen, we have
a special responsibility to ensure the most lethal Air Force the world has ever
seen flies and fights the right way. Airmen have inherited an Air Force forged
through the ingenuity, courage, and strength of Airmen who preceded them. An
Airman's duty is to continue to provide the Nation and the next generation of
Airmen an equally dominant Air Force. Doing so requires Airmen to fully
understand the profession of arms they have chosen, the commitment they made by
taking an oath of office, and the acceptance to live according to the Air
Force's core values. This is the warrior ethos and a mindset designed to build
the confidence and commitment necessary to shape professional Airmen able to
work as a team to accomplish the mission. This mindset is shaped by an
expeditionary service during combat, humanitarian response, disaster relief
operations, and by the lessons learned from those operations. The warrior ethos
is also developed and sustained over the course of a career through a continuum
of learning and associated development experiences, including a wide variety of
assignments, focused training and education, exhibiting pride in the Air Force
uniform, physical conditioning, and understanding Air Force symbols, history, and
culture.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>9.24.2. Airmen share a
history of service, honor, and sacrifice. From the earliest days of airpower to
the heights of space,</span></p>

<p><span>Airmen
have built an extraordinary heritage that forms the foundation for the
Service's boundless horizon. Even though we are technology focused, we value
quality over quantity. We embrace change and through transformation and
innovation ensure a viable Air Force for the future. Airmen firmly grounded in
the core values and ingrained with the warrior ethos react to combat stresses,
operational deployment pressures, and daily home station demands with valor,
courage, and sacrifice. We all have these characteristics, which surface often
during times of great difficulty or unforeseen circumstances. While many acts
of valor, courage or sacrifice go unseen, others helped shape the finest
traditions of the Air Force. They should be recognized not only as part of
United States Air Force history, but also to illustrate that any Airman may be
called upon to perform above and beyond in the profession of arms.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.25. Valor.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Valor
is the ability to face danger or hardship in a determined and resolute manner
and is commonly known as bravery, fearlessness, fortitude, gallantry, heart,
nerve, and many other terms. Valor is the willingness to step outside of one s
comfort zone to deal with an unexpected situation. Such situations can happen
almost anywhere. Valor exists in places other than on the battlefield; an
Airman can exhibit valor when presented with unusual circumstances in the daily
routine of life. When acting with valor, one expresses the qualities of a hero
or heroine.</span></p>

<p><i><span>In the summer of 2005, Senior Airman&nbsp;Shea&nbsp;Dodson wanted
to do more than his assigned administrative duties inside of Baghdad's Green
Zone. The call was out for volunteers to provide security for ongoing convoys,
so Airman Dodson raised his hand. After some intense just-in-time training, he
was performing security detail for his first convoy. On this mission, Airman
Dodson put that training to good use. When a suspected vehicle-borne suicide
bomber raced toward the convoy, he fired .50 caliber rounds into the engine
block no fewer than four times, disabling the vehicle. During the same mission,
his unit became mired in traffic near a high-rise development. He noticed
movement above and saw an Iraqi armed with an AK-47 creeping toward the edge of
a balcony overlooking the convoy. Airman Dodson immediately engaged with
indirect warning fire from his M-16, hitting the wall next to the suspected
insurgent's head. The armed Iraqi dove for cover and never returned. When the
convoy arrived at its final destination, a children's school, he continued with
a complete security sweep of the perimeter houses to ensure it was clear.
Airman Dodson remained on armed watch as his team handed out school supplies to
the kids in the open courtyard. By 2 PM that same day, Airman Dodson was back
at his desk, keeping track of critical data for the commanding general of the
Multinational Security Transition Command Iraq. It was all in a day's work for
this dedicated Airman.</span></i></p>

Force</span></p>

<p><i><span>As I prepare for this mission, I am a bit homesick  Mother and
Dad, you are very close to me, and I long so to talk to you. America has asked
much of our generation, but I m glad to give her all I have because she has
given me so much.</span></i></p>

<p><span>Sergeant Arnold Rahe,
U.S. Army Air Forces,&nbsp;WWII&nbsp; Killed&nbsp;in France; from a letter to
his parents</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.26. Courage.</span></b></p>

<p align="right"><span>Courage is about the
ability to face fear, danger, or adversity. Three types of courage are critical
in the profession of arms:</span></p>

<p><span>personal,
physical, and moral. Personal courage is about doing what's right even at risk
to one's career. Physical courage is the ability to overcome fears of bodily
harm to get the job done, or willingness to risk yourself for someone else s
sake in battle or the course of everyday life. Finally, moral courage is the
ability to stand by the core values when moral courage may not be the popular
thing to do. Integrity breeds courage when and where the behavior is most
needed. More often than not, courage is manifested as an act of bravery on the
battlefield as Airmen face the challenges present in combat.</span></p>

<p><i><span>While on a special mission in Southwest Asia in 2005, Technical
Sergeant Corey&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;was loading cargo on his aircraft when he saw
a Romanian C-130 experience a hard landing. Unbeknownst to the Romanian crew,
the aircraft brakes caused a fire, causing Sergeant&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;to spring
into action. He instructed a fellow loadmaster to inform his aircraft commander
of the situation and to ensure that someone contacted the control tower of the
fire while he and a crew chief grabbed fire extinguishers and ran toward the
burning aircraft. The Romanian C-130 fire intensified as it spread to the
aircraft's fuselage and ruptured the hydraulic brake line. Despite the danger
to himself, Sergeant&nbsp;Clewleygot within a few feet of the flames and
attempted to suppress the fire. His sense of urgency tripled when he realized
the C130 crew was still inside the aircraft and was unable to get out of the
burning aircraft. He saw a member of the crew mouthing  please, please  and
pointing to the troop exit door. Sergeant&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;refocused his attention
to that area and began suppressing the fire, enabling the crew to safely exit
the aircraft. He continued to keep the fire under control until the fire
department arrived. Sergeant&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;credits the team effort that
kept the incident from becoming a deadly event and never considered the risk to
his own life as he worked to save a crew and aircraft that was not part of his
responsibility, his service, or even his Nation. He noted that saving the lives
of the people on board was more important than who owned the aircraft.</span></i></p>

<p><span>Quotations from the Air
Force Memorial in Washington, District of Columbia</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.27. Sacrifice:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.27.1.
Sacrifice involves a willingness to give your life, time, or comfort to meet
others' needs. Personal sacrifice occurs on many levels, but is commonly
evident in the heroic actions of Airmen in combat. Day-to-day deployed garrison
activities also present opportunities to put others' needs before individual
wants.</span></p>

<p><i><span>Everyday people can confront their fears, pains and uncertainties
with courage or cower to the daily decisions facing them. Just being here
(at&nbsp;Manas&nbsp;Air Base), you have overcome many challenges with your
courage that helped prepare you to contribute to your Nation in tangible ways.
You faced basic training, skills training, and deployment to&nbsp;a location
worlds&nbsp;away from your normal life. All have taken courage and prepared you
for the impact you are making your decisions, your actions, your sacrifices of
the luxuries of home, friends, and family do make a difference. Every day, the
Airmen of&nbsp;Manas, from Airman Basic to Colonel, make decisions that have an
impact on the Global War on Terrorism! Without the contributions of the
individual soldier who pays the price to secure freedom for the many, the
mission does not get done. Simply put because Airmen have courage because
Airmen make sacrifices because Airmen are not intimidated by challenges because
YOU have the courage to live a life of sacrifice for the ideals of a nation,
the mission is accomplished day in and day out.</span></i></p>

Exemplifying the Air Force core values, Senior Airman Jason Cunningham, an Air
Force&nbsp;pararescueman&nbsp; performed&nbsp;actions during Operation Enduring
Freedom that earned him the thanks of a grateful Nation, at the cost of his
life. The Air Force Cross is awarded to United States and Foreign military
personnel and civilians who have displayed extraordinary heroism in one of the
following situations: while engaged in action against a United States enemy,
while engaged in military operations involving conflict with a foreign force,
or while serving with a Friendly nation engaged in armed conflict against a
force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The Air Force
Cross is awarded when the heroic actions fall just short of warranting the
Congressional Medal of Honor. Only 24 Airmen have been awarded the Air Force
Cross, the service's highest award, and only two, including Cunningham have
received the award since the end of the Vietnam War. Below is the citation for
Senior Airman Jason Cunningham's Air Force Cross.</span></p>

  <p align="center"><span>(POSTHUMOUS) TO</span></p>
  <p align="center"><span>JASON D. CUNNINGHAM</span></p>
  <p><span>The President of the
  United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, U.S.C.,
  awards the Air Force Cross to Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham for
  extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force
  while serving as a&nbsp;pararescueman&nbsp;near the village
  of&nbsp;Marzak&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Paktia&nbsp;Province of Afghanistan on 4
  March 2002. On that proud day, Airman Cunningham was the primary Air Force
  Combat Search and Rescue medic assigned to a Quick Reaction Force tasked to
  recover two American servicemen evading capture in austere terrain occupied
  by massed Al Qaida and Taliban forces. Shortly before landing, his MH-47E
  helicopter received accurate rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire,
  severely disabling the aircraft and causing it to crash land. The assault
  force formed a hasty defense and immediately suffered three fatalities and
  five critical casualties. Despite effective enemy fire, and at great risk to
  his own life, Airman Cunningham remained in the burning fuselage of the
  aircraft in order to treat the wounded. As he moved his patients to a more
  secure location, mortar rounds began to impact within fifty feet of his
  position. Disregarding this extreme danger, he continued the movement and
  exposed himself to enemy fire on seven separate occasions. When the second
  casualty collection point was also compromised, in a display of uncommon
  valor and gallantry, Airman Cunningham braved an intense small arms and
  rocket-propelled grenade attack while repositioning the critically wounded to
  a third collection point. Even after he was mortally wounded and quickly
  deteriorating, he continued to direct patient movement and transferred care
  to another medic. In the end, his distinct efforts led to the successful delivery
  of ten gravely wounded Americans to life-saving medical treatment. Through
  his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, aggressiveness in the face of
  the enemy, and in the dedication of his service to his country, Senior Airman
  Cunningham reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States
  Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.28. Profession of Arms Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.28.1.
We must remember that above all else, we are Airmen first. We, more than anyone
else, understand the price that is paid for freedom. Airmen, more than anyone
else, understand the sacrifices that come from willingly serving our country.
Finally, Airmen more than anyone else, understand the meaning of belonging to
the Profession of Arms.</span></p>

<p><span>9.28.2.
We must learn from history. Our shared touchstone of warrior virtues and
single, unifying purpose remain unchanged: fly, fight, and win. We must remain
true to the legacy of valor and devotion, so boldly written with contrails and
smoke across the skies from Ploesti and Schweinfurt, through MiG Alley and downtown
Hanoi, to Kandahar and Baghdad. This legacy defines our role in the American
way of war to risk the lives of Airmen to kick down the opponent's door so
thousands need not die.</span></p>

<p><span>9.29.1. One of the
telltale signs of a military professional is preparation. When the time comes
to use their skills, military professionals are ready because they took
advantage of opportunities to gain experience. Every military member will have
opportunities to serve. Those opportunities may be mundane, exciting, or
inconvenient, but each will provide a chance to gain experience and improve
readiness levels.</span></p>

<p><span>9.29.2.
Often, opportunities to serve do not look particularly exciting or rewarding,
but they hold the seeds of greatness. Doing such tasks builds the experience
level needed to sharpen judgment and discernment. Military members should be
open to a variety of experiences in order to grow in all areas of life
(physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual). Military professionals cannot be
disconnected from the world and must remember that the cost of choosing one
path may be the opportunity to take another.</span></p>

<p><span>9.29.3.
The military professional who stands ready to make critical decisions and is
able to perform under pressure is usually the one who took advantage of unique
opportunities that arose. From past experiences, professionals build the
confidence, judgment, courage, and integrity they need to act professionally.
Will they always feel ready? Probably not, but most will likely say they wish
they had more experience upon which to base their decisions or improve their
performance. Most experience is gained by accepting opportunities as they come,
even when conditions are not perfect.</span></p>

<p><span>9.29.4.
Certainly, no one can do everything. Members must select wisely to prevent
overloading and burnout. They can round out their perspective vicariously by
sharing others' experiences through reading. Charles, Archduke of Austria,
pointed to this thought when he said,  A great captain can be formed only by
long experience and intense study; neither is his own experience enough for
whose life is sufficiently fruitful of events to render his knowledge
universal? </span></p>

<p><b><span>9.30. Chief of Staff, United States Air Force
Professional Reading Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.30.1.
In 1996, General&nbsp;Fogleman&nbsp;created the Chief of Staff, United States
Air Force Professional Reading Program to develop a common frame of reference
among Air Force members officers, enlisted, and civilians to help each become
better, more effective advocates of air and space power. Each Chief of Staff,
United States Air Force since then has enhanced and continued the Chief of
Staff, United States Air Force's Professional Reading Program. In 2012, General
Norton A. Schwartz revised the list by adding books; films; technology,
entertainment, design briefings; and online resources.</span></p>

<p><span>9.30.2.
This program can help launch a career-long reading habit or be used to
supplement previous readings. Listed materials cover various topics, although
the majority detail air and space power from its genesis to recent times. These
sources provide great examples of leadership to illustrate qualities Airmen
should emulate. The list includes insight into Air Force history, analyze
ongoing conflicts and their relevancy to the future, furnish organizational and
leadership success stories, and provide lessons learned from recent conflicts.
The more you study, the better you will understand the background behind the
Air Force's core competencies and the better equipped you will be to form and
express your own opinions.</span></p>

<p><span>9.30.3.
The Headquarters Air Force Historian (HQ USAF/HO) is responsible for day-to-day
management of the reading list. The reading list is particularly relevant as
civilian men and women take on more responsibility in these times of global
terrorism and international conflict. Most of the books were chosen because of
their readability. Their selection does not reflect Chief of Staff, United
States Air Force or United States Air Force endorsement of the authors' views
or interpretations. Access the updated reading list and a brief summary of new
selections at</span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.af.mil/library/csafreading/index.asp"><span>http://www.af.mil/library/csafreading/index.asp</span></a><a href="http://www.af.mil/library/csafreading/index.asp"><span>.</span></a><span>&nbsp;Air University will supply each Air Force
library with multiple copies of each new book on the list.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.31. Core Values:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.31.1.
Core values are at the heart and soul of the military profession:&nbsp;<i>integrity
first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.&nbsp;</i>Such values
are closely intertwined since integrity provides the bedrock for our military
endeavors, and is fortified by service to country. This in turn fuels the drive
for excellence. In light of the demands placed upon our people to support
United States security interests around the globe, the concept of  service
before self  needs further discussion. As members of the joint team, Airmen are
part of a unique profession founded on the premise of service before self.
Airmen are not engaged in just another job: they are practitioners of the
profession of arms. They are entrusted with the security of the Nation, the
protection of their citizens, and the preservation of their way of life. In
this capacity, they serve as guardians of America's future, and this
responsibility requires Airmen to place the needs of service and country before
personal concerns.</span></p>

<p><span>9.31.2.
The military profession is sharply distinguished from others by what General
Sir John Hackett has termed the  unlimited liability clause.  Upon entering the
Air Force, Airmen accept a sacred trust from the American people. They swear to
support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
foreign and domestic. They take this obligation freely without any reservations
and thereby commit their lives in defense of America and their citizens.</span></p>

<p><span>9.31.3. No other
profession expects their members to lay down their lives for their friends,
families, or freedoms. By voluntarily serving in the military profession,
Airmen accept unique responsibilities. In today's world, service to country
requires not only a high degree of skill, but also a willingness to make
personal sacrifices. Airmen work long hours to provide the most combat
capability possible for the taxpayer dollar. Military professional's duties
require them to go temporary duty or permanent change of station to harsh
locations to meet national security needs; are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week; and when called, deploy to the far corners of the globe without
complaint.</span></p>

<p><span>9.31.4.
Inherent in all of this is individual willingness to subordinate personal
interests for the good of the unit, Service, and Nation. Airmen can ill afford
 sunshine soldiers,  or those who focus on careerism. Instead, the military
needs professionals who strive to be the best at their current job, and who
realize they attain individual advancement through the success of their unit or
work center. Careerism can be most damaging in the case of leaders. If
subordinates perceive leaders are consumed with career concerns, they will be
unwilling to forgo personal goals for the good of the unit and the Air Force.
This situation is only aggravated by attempts to serve  through a position  or
to do a quick  touch and go  in a key job simply to fill out a resume.
Ultimately, the mission will suffer with potentially devastating consequences.</span></p>

<p><span>9.31.5.
So, what is the payoff for placing service before self? The paycheck or the
benefits is not what keeps the professionals going. Professionals remain with
the Air Force because of the intangibles: the satisfaction gained from doing
something significant with their lives, the pride in being part of a unique
organization that lives by high standards, and the sense of accomplishment
gained from defending the Nation and their democratic way of life.</span></p>

<p><b><span>9.32. Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>9.32.1.
This chapter discusses the philosophy, purpose, and structure of the enlisted
force and examines the NCO in terms of rank and precedence, legal authority,
and general and specific responsibilities.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;briefly described is
the special positions of trust senior NCOs may hold, such as Air Force career
filed manager, first sergeant, Command Chief Master Sergeant, and Chief Master
Sergeant of the Air Force, and concludes with a discussion of the profession of
arms.</span></p>

<p><span>9.32.2.
The word  professional  should inspire all enlisted members to aspire to the
ideal of service and expertise. Professional status comes to people at
different times in their lives and careers. Furthermore, professionalism is
achieved through continuous study, practice, and experience. Overall, the
military seems to fit strongly into the professional category, but at what
point can an individual claim professional military status? Professional status
is expressed by attitudes and commitments, and by internalizing military
values. Studying and understanding these factors are vital to the senior NCO
and the future of the United States Air Force. Every senior NCO has an
obligation to the United States, to the Air Force, and to his or her supervisor
and subordinates to be the very best professional possible.</span></p>

<p><span>9.32.3.
Future military members must educate themselves through study, experience, and
by observing others. They must learn to accept responsibility for their actions
and those of their subordinates, and to take appropriate action, never hiding
behind excuses. Their focus must be on devoted service to the Nation, not on
pay, working conditions, or their next assignment. Only then will they move
toward achieving the ideal of professionalism.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>LEADERSHIP&nbsp;</span></b><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 10A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>As
the old adage  a born leader  implies, those who lead were intended to,
or&nbsp;<i>supposed</i>&nbsp;to, lead since the day they were born; but how
could that be true? Is leadership a characteristic shared only by those gifted
enough to lead or is it simply defined by a person's position and authority?
After all, given the authority anyone can command, but what sort of influence
does one who merely commands and directs have on those who follow? In all
actuality, leadership is an ability we all can develop and a leader s
effectiveness is often determined by the actions of those who choose to follow.
Leadership is a delicate mix of art and science requiring people-oriented
attributes, interpersonal communication, and an undeniable character that
motivates, or wills, others to follow. This chapter examines the art and
science of leadership and includes information to assist Airmen in
understanding what leadership is, how it pertains to the Air Force mission, and
why it is important to the institution of airpower. This chapter continues with
a brief explanation of the differences, and interrelationships between
leadership and management, offers an opportunity to assess one's leadership
qualities, and advice on how to become a more effective leader. Furthermore, it
explains the concept of vision, empowerment, and provides information
pertaining to leadership flexibility and followership. Lastly, we will explore
ways to effectively manage change and mentor followers.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 10B Leadership</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.2. The Art and Science of Leadership.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Merriam-Webster s
dictionary defines the word&nbsp;<i>lead</i>&nbsp;as  to guide on a way
especially by going in advance  or  to direct on a course or in a direction.  A
leader is considered a person  who directs a military force or unit  and/or
 who has commanding authority or influence.  With this in mind, we can explain
the act of leading in the Air Force as  the art and science of accomplishing
the Air Force mission by motivating, influencing, and directing Airmen.  This
highlights two central elements: (1) the mission; objective, or task to be
accomplished; and (2) the Airmen who will accomplish it. All aspects of
leadership should support the Air Force mission and its Airmen. Successful
leaders recognize that people are the most valuable resource and, without them;
the organization fails. Therefore, the Air Force relies on its members to
develop as leaders for today, and tomorrow. The extent of a person s
development is dependent on his or her status within the organization (whether
as an officer, enlisted, or civilian), and the level of responsibility he or
she has. Most enlisted members function at the tactical level where their
technical skills are combined with their direct influence on subordinate
members in daily operations and at war.</span></p>

<p><i><span> Good leaders are people who have a passion to succeed .To become
successful leaders, we must first learn that no matter how good the technology
or how shiny the equipment, people-to-people relations get things done in our
organizations. People are the assets that determine our success or failure. If
you are to be a good leader, you have to cultivate your skills in the arena of
personal relations. </span></i></p>

<p><span>General
Ronald R. Fogleman Former Air Force Chief of Staff</span></p>

<p><span>10.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Set the Example.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Effective
leadership takes more than simply  talking the talk.  Leadership is modeling,
or setting the example for others in word and action. For many, this is
considered the toughest part of leading. However, in order to be successful,
leaders must evaluate themselves and work on their shortcomings. Effective
leaders&nbsp;<i>lead</i>&nbsp;rather than drive people. They make fair and firm
decisions that are in the best interest of good order, discipline, and
successful accomplishment of the mission. A leader's responsibilities go
further than just being responsible for accomplishing the mission. Effective
leaders are not only expected to accomplish the mission, but to do so with a
minimal cost in resources, such as people, materiel, and money. While no one
expects the leader to be perfect, a leader cannot demand the best from others
if he or she cannot perform as expected.</span></p>

<p><span>10.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Motivate Intrinsically.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Intrinsic
motivation is encouraging others to act, not because they have to; but because
they want to. The Air Force continuously adapts in new and innovative ways to
conduct daily operations, and requires leaders who can initiate and sustain
change. To motivate intrinsically, consider ways to get others to embrace
ideas, strategies, and initiatives.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>10.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Involvement.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
leader's success is reflected in the efficiency, productivity, morale, and
enthusiasm demonstrated by the followers and a leader's involvement is
essential to maximizing worker performance and the mission. Leaders become a positive
influence when they are actively involved in their Airmen's careers. Although
service members are obligated to  obey the orders of the President of the U.S.
and the orders of the officers appointed over [them],  they respond more
positively and with extra effort to those who genuinely care about them. In
today's environment of technology and specialization, most leaders tend to find
this environment allows them to neglect the need of knowing their subordinate
members of the organization, and show sincere concern in their problems, career
development, and welfare.</span></p>

<p><span>10.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Learning from Failure.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Leadership
is all about risks and rewards and effective leaders realize that failure is
possibly one of the greatest learning tools an organization has for achieving
success. With every risk there is the potential for failure; however, these are
the moments which shed light on the faults that exist within an organization,
its processes, and procedures. Effective leaders realize that learning from
failure empowers change and inspires efforts to improve. Therefore, leaders
never fear failure, they embrace it.</span></p>

<p><span>10.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Transparency.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Direction,
decisions, and actions are rarely challenged if the leader's intentions are
transparent. Transparency is accomplished by integrating regular communication,
shared decision-making, mutual consensus, and healthy debate. Airmen should
know the reason decisions were made and how that decision will impact them and
the organization. Transparent leaders should not micromanage, give credit where
credit is due, and take accountability when things fail.</span></p>

<p><span>10.2.6.&nbsp;<b>Flexibility.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Top-down,
authoritative organizations is a classic example of rigid and stubborn
leadership and usually results in resentment and animosity, especially during
times of change. Leaders who are flexible listen to other points of view, bend
when necessary, and are not afraid to change course if things are not going
well.</span></p>

<p><span>10.2.7.&nbsp;<b>Resilience.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Leaders
at every level within an organization constantly face challenges, changes, and
criticisms. There will always be times of uncertainty, deviation, turmoil, and
at times, conflict. Therefore, resilient leaders must possess a combination of
compassion and thick skin.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>10.2.8.<b>&nbsp;Accountability.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Good
things come to those who are accountable, and leaders play an important part in
ensuring accountability in the workplace. Promoting accountability in the
workplace includes establishing clear roles and responsibilities, cultivating a
sense of pride and ownership among the members and teams within the
organization, providing regular feedback to subordinates, and leading with
integrity and by positive example are all responsibilities of a leader.
Accountability does not focus on the discipline and punishment associated with
being unaccountable; but rather, concentrates on creating, and sustaining, a
continuously learning and always improving organization.</span></p>

<p><i><span> Give people opportunities to take pride in their work and
personal growth. People want to do well at their job; you have to help them do
that. </span></i></p>

<p><b><span>10.3. Leadership Self-Evaluation.</span></b></p>

<p><span>To
successfully accomplish the responsibilities of a position, one must first
understand what is expected of them. The following is a list of questions that
offer a perspective as to what is expected of a leader and assist aspiring
leaders develop particular skills. Only the most honest responses to these
questions will reveal one's definite strengths and potential weaknesses.
Positively and proactively responding to the results will provide direction
upon which to concentrate efforts to improve.</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Do I
have the courage to make tough decisions and stand by them?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Am I
flexible when dealing with changing situations?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Can
I remain enthusiastic and cheerful when I am confronted with seemingly
impossible tasks?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>Am I
willing to do my best with what seems to be inadequate means?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.5.<b>&nbsp;</b>Can
I inspire people to achieve outstanding results?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.6.<b>&nbsp;</b>Am I

productive?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.7.<b>&nbsp;</b>Am I

<p><span>10.3.8.<b>&nbsp;</b>Does
my manner invite communication?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.9.<b>&nbsp;</b>Do I
really listen? Can I withhold judgment until I have all the facts?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.10.<b>&nbsp;</b>Am
I willing to accept my Airmen's failures as my own, yet immediately recognize
their successes as theirs?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.11.<b>&nbsp;</b>Am
I able to do many things at one time? Can I manage a complex job?</span></p>

<p><span>10.3.12.<b>&nbsp;</b>Can
I carry out orders as well as give them?</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.4. Advice to Leaders.</span></b></p>

<p><span>There
are no secrets or  magic formulas' to successful leadership. Rather, leadership
is an individual and personal choice and everyone develops their own unique
leadership style. Although the best advice is to just be yourself, all
ambitious leaders can always benefit from the wise words of others. In 1976,
while he was Commander in Chief, Pacific Air Forces, General Louis L. Wilson,
Jr., wrote the following timeless advice:</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Be Tough.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Set
your standards high and insist that your people measure up. Have the courage to
correct those who fail to do so. In the long run, your people will be happier.
Almost certainly morale will be higher, your outfit better, and your people
prouder.</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Get Out from Behind Your Desk.</b></span></p>

<p><span>See for yourself what is
going on in your work center. Your Airmen will see that you are interested in
their problems, work conditions, and welfare. Many of your people problems will
go away if you practice this point.</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.3.<b>&nbsp;Search Out the Problems.</b></span></p>

<p><span>If you think there are
no problems in your organization, you may be ignorant to problems that are not
obvious. The trick is to find them. Foster an environment that encourages
people to bring problems to you.</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.4.<b>&nbsp;Find the Critical Path to
Success.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Get
personally involved in issues on a priority basis. Let your influence be felt
on make-or-break issues in your organization. Avoid the  activity trap  do not
spend your valuable time on inconsequential or trivial matters.</span></p>

<p><span>Weigh in where it
counts.</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.5.&nbsp;<b>Be Sensitive.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Listen
to your people. Communicate with them and be perceptive to their needs. Learn
to recognize problems and seek out ideas. Be innovative. Recognize that
effective communication involves shared perceptions. Do not be afraid to
empathize when necessary. Listen, listen, and listen!</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.6.<b>&nbsp;Do Not Take Things for Granted.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Do not assume things
have been fixed look for yourself. Furthermore, do not assume problems will
stay fixed.</span></p>

<p><span>The probability is high
that fixed problems will recur, so regularly monitor your processes.</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.7.<b>&nbsp;Do Not Alibi.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Remember,
you and your people will never be perfect. People will make mistakes, so do not
be defensive about things that are wrong. Nothing is more disgusting than the
individual who can do no wrong and has an alibi for anything and everything
that goes awry.</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.8.<b>&nbsp;Do Not Procrastinate.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Do
not put off those hard decisions because you are not willing to make them
today; as they will not be any easier tomorrow. This does not mean you should
make precipitous or unreasonable decisions just to be prompt. However, once you
have arrived at what you believe is correct, get on with it. Do not block
progress.</span></p>



<p><span>10.4.9.&nbsp;<b>Do Not Tolerate Incompetence.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Once
people demonstrate laziness, disinterest, or an inability to get the job done,
you must have the courage to terminate their assignments. You cannot afford to
do less. On the other hand, when your people are doing good work, recognize the
good work and encourage them. Certainly they will do even better.</span></p>

<p><span>10.4.10.&nbsp;<b>Be Honest.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When talking to your people be candid and insist that they do
likewise. They set their behavior patterns based upon your example. Nothing is
more disastrous than garbled information, half-truths, and falsifications. Make
sure your people know where you stand on this matter. Encourage them to come to
you if they have questions about what is going on in the unit. You must create
an atmosphere of trust and confidence. Finally, be honest with yourself do not
gimmick reports and figures to make things look good on paper. Advice from a
successful leader can be a beneficial tool to the aspiring leader, but where
the aspiring leader applies this tool will determine his or her success.</span></p>

<p><span>The perfect place to
start is Air Force standards.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.5. Air Force Standards.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air
Force standards of conduct, discipline, and customs and courtesies reflect the
Air Force's broad heritage and traditions. Air Force leaders must not only know
these standards, they must enforce them. While current Department of Defense
and Air Force policies provide specific guidance on standards, leaders must be
familiar with the following:</span></p>

<p><span>10.5.1.<b>&nbsp;Mission.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force's mission is to fly, fight, and win in air, space, and cyberspace. To
achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives unhindered by time,
distance, and geography; the Air Force employs six distinctive capabilities of
Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision
Engagement, Information Superiority, and Agile Combat Support. The three Air
Force Core Values of Integrity First, Service before Self, and Excellence in
All We Do, enables Airmen to effectively execute their responsibilities and
accomplish the mission.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>10.5.2.<b>&nbsp;Oath.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Upon entering the Air
Force, each member voluntarily takes a sworn oath of enlistment. With every
oath, enlisted members reaffirm their belief and public commitment to the
following:</span></p>

<p><i><span>I, (name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and
defend the Constitution of the U.S. against all enemies, foreign and domestic;
that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and that I will obey
the orders of the President of the U.S. and the orders of the officers
appointed over me according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. So help me God.</span></i></p>

<p><span>10.5.3.&nbsp;<b>Way of Life.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen
are on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year; and if so directed by a competent
authority, must report for duty at any time, at any location, for as long as
necessary to complete the task at hand. Due to the importance of the Air Force
mission, the dangers associated with military service, and the national and
international influence and potential implications relevant to global
operations; the Air Force enforces more restrictive rules and elevated
standards than those found in the civilian community. Individuals unable to
maintain these higher standards, or are deemed not compatible with military
service will not be retained in the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>10.5.4.&nbsp;<b>Chain of Command.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
chain of command provides the authority, communications, and control necessary
to accomplish the missionrelated tasks at every echelon of the Air Force. Each
level is responsible for all lower levels and accountable to all higher levels.
The chain will not work without loyalty at every level. The key to an effective
chain of command is trusting the system and resolving issues at the lowest
possible level.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>10.5.5.&nbsp;<b>Conduct.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force's mission is critical to national security, global stability, and
international relations. Therefore, each member has specific responsibilities
for accomplishing their part in the mission. Airmen carry out orders, perform
specific duty-related tasks, and uphold Air Force standards. Supervisors
enforce these standards and ensure their Airmen understand and fulfill them at
all times. Standards of conduct apply to both on-duty and off-duty behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>10.5.6.&nbsp;<b>Professional Relationships.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To maintain a successful
and effective military organization, the Air Force depends on professional
relationships</span></p>

<p><span>among
all its members (both military and civilian). All interactions and
relationships must support the mission and operational effectiveness of the Air
Force. Officers and Enlisted alike must ensure their relationships with
coworkers, superiors, and subordinates do not portray favoritism or
impropriety. Excessive socialization and undue familiarity, whether real or
perceived, degrades morale, team cohesion, and leadership effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.6. Leadership Versus Management.</span></b></p>

<p><i><span>"Leaders are people
who do the right thing. Managers are people who do things right."</span></i></p>

<p align="center"><span>Warren G. Bennis, Ph.D.</span></p>

<p><span>Founding
Chair, The Leadership Institute, University of Southern California</span></p>

<p><span>10.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Which Is More Important?</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Leadership
and management are simply not the same thing. Successful organizations include
and depend on elements of control, trust, administration, development, standardization,
innovation, compliance, and inspiration. Leadership and management go hand in
hand in producing these elements which promote mission success. Throughout
military history, there have been accounts of leadership and management in
action. For instance, during the D-Day Invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944,
some believe this invasion was an effective use of management which moved the
U.S. and coalition forces onto the beaches, and the inspirational leadership is
what moved them forward. So which is more important?</span></p>

<p><span>10.6.2.<b>&nbsp;Roles of Leadership and
Management.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To better understand the
roles of leadership and management, consider them in terms of behavior,
personal characteristics, and organizational situation.</span></p>

<p><span>10.6.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Behavior:</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.6.2.1.1.
Managerial behaviors focus on building organizational mechanisms that mesh
together like the parts of a complex timepiece whereas leadership behaviors
concentrate on effectively moving the hands of the timepiece to display the
correct time. The behavioral focus of each is clearly important; but, while the
manager may be preoccupied with the precision of the process, the leader
concentrates on the inertial forces that affect the process.</span></p>

<p><i><span>"Management is getting people to do what needs to be done.
Leadership is getting people to want to do what needs to be done. </span></i></p>

<p><span>The words of Field

Managers use the management process to control people by pushing them in the
right direction. Leaders motivate and inspire people to keep moving in the
right direction by satisfying human needs. In order to achieve a vision,
leaders tailor their behavior toward their followers' needs for achievement,
sense of belonging, recognition, self-esteem, and control over their lives.
Bennis offers an appropriate summary of this behavioral characteristics
comparison in Figure 10.1.</span></p>

<p><span>10.6.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Personal
Characteristics.&nbsp;</b>Figure 10.1 also illustrates a comparison of
successful leaders and managers, as researched by Professor Robert White,
Indiana University. Neither type of behavior is exclusively positive or
negative. Figure 10.1 suggests that leaders must have a grasp of management and
leadership skills to be successful. Moreover, the two cannot (and should not)
be separated. In other words, leadership is an art that includes management.
The best managers tend to become good leaders because they develop leadership
abilities and skills through practicing good management techniques. Similarly,
seldom is there an effective leader who is not also a good manager. Successful
leaders humanize their management skills with inspiration, empowerment, and
vision through charisma.</span></p>

<p><span>10.6.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Organizational Situation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.6.2.3.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>What
are the organizational implications of management and leadership? Leaders
launch and steer the organization toward the pursuit of goals and strategies
while managers ensure the resources needed are readily available and
efficiently used. Managers are responsible for organizing projects, staffing
positions with qualified individuals, communicating plans, delegating
responsibilities, and devising systems to monitor implementation.</span></p>

<p><span>Leadership
supports these actions by aligning the personnel's needs, wants, emotions, and
aspirations with the task. They understand the vision are committed and
encourage others. (<b>Note:<i>&nbsp;</i></b>The concept of vision is discussed
in paragraph 10.8.)</span></p>

<p><span>10.6.2.3.2.
To be successful, an organization needs both leadership and management. For an
organization, strong leadership with weak management is no better, and
sometimes worse, than the opposite. The challenge is to achieve a balance of
strong leadership and capable management. While not the most effective
approach, a peacetime military can survive with good administration and
management up and down the hierarchy, coupled with good leadership concentrated
at the top. On the other hand, a wartime force must have competent leadership
at all levels, particularly at the tactical level of war. Good management
brings a degree of order and consistency to key issues like readiness,
availability, and sustainment. However, no one has yet figured out how to
manage people into battle. They must be led.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.7. Leadership Qualities:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.7.1.<b>&nbsp;Positive Attitude.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Leaders
must demonstrate the attitude they hope to see emulated by their followers. In
doing so, this same attitude will be more easily adopted by their Airmen. Enthusiasm
is contagious and can deliver energy to all aspects of organizational
operations. Although encouragement is normally considered an action,
encouragement is actually attitude related. The inclination to encourage
Airmen, as well as oneself, is a powerful motivator and satisfies human needs.
Effective leaders constantly embrace positive goals and display a positive
attitude.</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.2.<b>&nbsp;Values.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
degree to which trust, loyalty, and integrity are present in the leadership of
an organization directly relates to the organization's effectiveness.
Leadership is the capacity to generate and sustain trust, and trust is
dependent upon reliability. Indicators of reliability, such as punctual
attendance at all meetings, prompt attention to correspondence, and meeting
task deadlines translate into the level of trust people have in one another.
Trust must also be balanced with a willingness to remove people who cannot be
trusted and to make tough decisions when necessary. While the right decision is
not always the easiest decision, Airmen respect leaders for doing the right
thing and reward leadership with their own trustworthiness and loyalty. Like
trust, the doors of loyalty swing both ways. Leaders cannot demand unwavering
loyalty of their followers without being willing to return loyalty to them.
Integrity is a consistent and honest demonstration of personal commitment to
the organization and its vision. Therefore, leaders should be ever mindful of
the ramifications of their behavior and strive to epitomize the Air Force core
value of&nbsp;<i>Integrity First</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.3.&nbsp;<b>Character.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
character traits of effective leaders include charisma, compassion, and
courage. Effective leadership is a combination of competence and character.
Lack of character, however, will most often prevent individuals from becoming
great leaders.</span></p>

<p><i><span>"But what if the leader, government-appointed or
self-appointed, shouts,  Follow me!  and no one does? When do men sometimes
follow him, and shout enthusiastically too? Something called  character  must
be apparent in the leader. The followers must like him and want to be like him,
or want him to like them. When it's over, they want him private, sergeant,
lieutenant, or even General</span></i></p>

<p><i><span>Eisenhower to clap them
on the shoulder and say he's proud of them."</span></i></p>

<p align="center"><span>Paul Fussell, Ph.D.,</span></p>

<p><span>The Great War and Modern
Memory</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Charisma.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>According
to Webster, charisma is a special characteristic of leadership that inspires
allegiance and devotion. Charisma can be effective, but is not a cure-all for
leadership needs. German sociologist Max Weber's research noted that charisma
is often contrary to authority; superiors consequently frown on it.
Additionally, once it becomes  old hat  to Airmen, charisma's attraction and
powers wane. Further, Airmen can easily spot disingenuous charisma, a
characteristic that eventually erodes mission effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Compassion.&nbsp;</b>Compassion
is the sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of
others. Coupled with understanding, compassion is an important leadership trait.
Because the human psyche bruises easily, most Airmen withhold their true
feelings, often to the point of distress. Additionally, if Airmen do not share
their feelings, NCOs will struggle to help Airmen improve their performance.
Compassion promotes healthy, open, and honest communication and provides the
stimulus to discuss one's inner thoughts and feelings.</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Courage.</b>&nbsp;Courage
can take many forms. Leaders must demonstrate both moral and physical courage
not only in combat and in high-risk situations, but in day-to-day life.
Leadership requires the courage to address substandard performance or
unacceptable behavior, to welcome new ideas, do what is ethically right when
others prefer to do otherwise, and to be honest. Acts of courage inspires others
to be courageous as well and helps them to maintain composure in stressful
situations and provides the stimulus and encouragement to endure hardships.</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.4.<b>&nbsp;Credibility.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Credibility
is the quality of being trusted and believed in. Credible leaders must exercise
and demonstrate humility, commitment to the organization and mission, and
optimize operations by tapping into the unique strengths of each team member.
Occasionally, leaders must  get their hands dirty  alongside their followers
which also bolsters credibility. However, credibility is very fragile and takes
years to earn through persistent, consistent, and patient leadership and can
easily be lost with one thoughtless action, decision, or behavior. In the
present era, leaders are challenged to demonstrate their credibility even more.
Successful leaders earn credibility through leading by example and taking
responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Leading
by Example.<i>&nbsp;</i></b>Leaders lead by example. Leaders can be positive
role models when they lead by example and pay attention to what they believe is
important. Through positive behavior, leaders show others that they live by
their values. They reinforce their credibility when they do not dwell on the
effort they have put forth. Plus, Airmen are impressed when leaders do not
exhibit undue strain in difficult circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span>10.7.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Taking
Responsibility.&nbsp;</b>A crucial element of a leader's credibility is taking
responsibility not only for his or her individual actions, but also for those
of the Airmen.</span></p>

<p><i><span>"All this has been my fault. It is I who have lost this
fight, and you must help me out of it the best way you can."</span></i></p>

<p><b><span>10.8. Vision.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air
Force leaders must have a collective vision; a vision that empowers, inspires,
challenges, and motivates followers to the highest levels of commitment and a
continuous process improvement environment. Therefore, we must embrace and
communicate the Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century vision. The
vision for Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century is to establish a
continuous process improvement environment in which all Airmen are actively
eliminating waste and continuously improving processes. These improvements must
be centered on the core missions Airmen are responsible for conducting;
specifically to maintain the asymmetric advantages and capabilities the Air
Force delivers in air, space, and cyberspace. We need to ensure we are also
driving efficiencies and improvements across the board. Therefore, we must use
the right tools and techniques to see and attack problems and leverage
opportunities for improvement and employ our greatest resource: innovative,
dedicated Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>10.8.1.<b>&nbsp;What Is Vision?&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.8.1.1.
Vision is helping people believe they can accomplish their goals in the
anticipation of a better future as a result of their own efforts. Inspiration
is one way to convey vision. To better understand this concept, consider the
following examples: President Franklin D. Roosevelt's announcement in May 1940
that the U.S. would produce 50,000 planes a year, and President John F.
Kennedy's 1961 announcement of the U.S. intention to put a man on the moon
within the decade. Both goals were breathtaking, perhaps impossible by most
standards, and yet both were achieved. In each case, the dramatic announcement
and the infectious inspiration bred helped achieve the goal.</span></p>

<p><span>10.8.1.2.
The ability to form mental images of a possible outcome and to translate these
images into a reality through leadership and action is a unique feature of the
human brain. A leader should constantly anticipate the influences, trends, and
demands that affect the vision over the next month, year, even decade.
Unfortunately, a common leadership error is to become preoccupied with the present
at the expense of the future. To be of realistic value, the vision must be
logical, deductive, and plausible. Vision must be specific enough to provide
real guidance to people, but unbounded enough to encourage initiative and
demonstrate relevancy to a variety of conditions. Leaders without vision are
doomed to perpetuate complacency. They fail to prosper because they continue
doing things as they have always been done.</span></p>

<p><span>10.8.2.<b>&nbsp;Implementing the Vision.</b></span></p>

<p><span>While
senior leadership has the authority and responsibility to change the system as
a whole, leaders at lower levels direct supervisors and subordinates to tasks
more appropriate to the challenges of the new age. To do this, the leaders must
communicate the vision to the unit, shop, or work center. Leaders are
responsible for bolstering their Airmen's courage and understanding. However,
launching a vision cannot be a single effort. Those who work for and with the
leader are excellent sources of ideas. Leaders can prepare the organization for
potential changes to come and disarm resistance to change by soliciting
suggestions and promoting wide participation.&nbsp;<i>"A great leader s
courage to fulfill his vision comes from passion, not position."</i></span></p>

<p align="center"><span>John C. Maxwell</span></p>

<p align="right"><i><span>The 21 Irrefutable Laws
of Leadership</span></i></p>

<p><span>10.8.3.<b>&nbsp;The Downside.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Even
a clearly articulated and achievable vision may flounder if appropriate
resource management and leadership practices do not accompany the vision.
Sometimes the vision becomes an obsession and, as a result, adversely affects
leader and follower judgment. What is crucial about the vision is not the
originality, but, how well the vision serves the mission requirements,
strategic goals of the unit, and the Air Force as a whole.</span></p>

<p><span>10.8.4.<b>&nbsp;Maintaining the Vision.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Every
leader needs to establish an enduring vision. A vision that meets the
organization's needs at the time of implementation, over time, is unlikely to
be applicable without changes. There is no regular schedule for vision
revision. However, a wise leader does not wait for the alarm to sound before
considering alternatives. Rather, the vision-forming process should be
continual. Leaders should encourage personnel of all ranks, levels, and
occupations to help articulate the vision. The experience will prove invaluable
as unit members are promoted into more responsible, higher-level positions and
continue to build an effective path to the future. On the other hand, the
vision should not be arbitrarily modified. If the vision works and is
consistent with environmental and technological developments, the vision should
be affirmed and supported. As technology and our environment continue to
evolve, our vision and leadership style must keep pace.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.9. Empowerment:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.9.1.<b>&nbsp;Empowerment Defined.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Empowerment
is a force that energizes people and provides responsibility, ownership, and
control over the work they perform. Some individuals interpret empowerment as
merely the delegation of authority. Delegation is not empowerment; however,
effective empowerment does require good delegation. Assigning people tasks,
along with the freedom and authority needed to creatively accomplish the tasks,
is the essence of empowerment. Consequently, empowerment is often confused with
participative leadership emphasizing sensitivity to needs, involving people,
and asking people for help. While empowerment includes these concepts,
empowerment goes much further and allows workers to become stakeholders in the
organization's vision. Once they are committed to this vision, organization
members begin to participate in shaping and fashioning the vision into a shared
vision. This synergistically developed vision motivates people to focus on the
future and what the future holds, not simply because they&nbsp;<i>must</i>, but
because they&nbsp;<i>want</i>&nbsp;to. For this approach to be successful,
leaders must always be open and receptive to ideas and suggestions that could
improve or refine the organization's vision.</span></p>

<p><span>10.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Essence of Empowerment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.9.2.1.
The essence of empowerment requires both leaders and followers to identify with
their respective share of the organization's goals. The military is
traditionally an authoritarian organization. The need for rapid decisionmaking
and crisis response normally necessitates a traditional hierarchical framework.
However, complex hierarchical frameworks do not always result in rapid
decisions. Furthermore, the continual transformation of leaderfollower roles is
heralding an environment that allows both leaders and followers to more
effectively realize organizational goals and objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>10.9.2.2.
Effective empowerment is not new. Truly great leaders of the past never
directly told their people how to do their jobs. Rather, they explained what
needed to be done and established a playing field that allowed their people to
achieve success on their own. Consequently, the follower's success became a
success for the leader and the organization as well. While the responsibility
for task completion may be on the leader's shoulders, the burden of getting the
job done is shared by all. Therefore, the adage,  It's lonely at the top,  is
applicable to a leader who does not recognize the strengths of his or her
people. Airmen can supply the details and express concerns that help overcome
barriers to achieving visionary goals and mission accomplishment. When leaders
solicit input, they discover the knowledge, interest, and parameters of
support.</span></p>

<p><span>10.9.3.<b>&nbsp;Guidelines to Empowerment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Empowerment
enhances organizational performance by promoting contributions from every
member of the organization. Trust is the cornerstone of the mutually dependent
relationship shared by leaders and followers. Therefore, the leader must be
flexible and patient in introducing empowerment. By delegating decisions to
those closest to the issues and by allowing Airmen flexibility in how they
implement the vision, the leader successfully allows others to take ownership
of the vision and experience pride in achieving the vision. Thus, the leader
must maintain a firm grip on operational requirements and strategic planning.
The leader must also realize that not everyone is willing or ready to accept
the reins of empowerment. To realize their potential in fulfilling the vision,
empowered followers need sufficient training on the task at hand. Otherwise,
they are doomed to fail. On the other hand, Airmen who have expert knowledge in
a particular field should be encouraged to use this knowledge and improve the
vision where and when possible. Recognition is a key factor in perpetuating
improvements. Hence, an important facet of empowerment is the appropriate
recognition of contributions Airmen make to maximize mission success.</span></p>

<p><span>10.9.4.<b>&nbsp;Potential Pitfalls.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Empowerment
is frequently misunderstood and applied inappropriately. Empowerment is often
associated with a laissez-faire style of leadership (abdicating responsibility
for tasks to Airmen who are left to their own devices). This fire-and-forget
approach to empowerment demonstrates a total absence of leadership. Conversely,
empowerment is a leader-subordinate relationship that requires even more
refined supervisory skills than traditional autocracy. People continually need
direction, knowledge, resources, and support. Furthermore, empowerment and
vision cannot be imposed. To do so would breed compliance rather than
commitment. From an application standpoint, many leaders seek consensus as a
means to empower their people. However, while consensus is assumed to be good
because consensus represents what the group as a whole wants, consensus is
usually safe and free of innovative ideas. Additionally, consensus can divert
an organization from their true goal or vision. The adage that  a camel is a
horse built by consensus' is not so farfetched. Leaders do not seek
consensus they build it.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.10. Learning:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.10.1.<b>&nbsp;The Leader's Responsibilities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Life
in the military incorporates a perpetual requirement for continued training and
education. Effective leaders must accept the responsibility of being both a
master student and master teacher and should influence others by example.
Training is used to communicate and implement the organization's vision and
values at the supervisory and subordinate levels. Training is not only
fundamental in focusing the organization's strategic vision, but also helps
develop the capabilities of the Airmen who make the vision a reality. Both
formal and informal training do more than augment a unit's level of technical
expertise. By providing the skills Airmen need to be successful, organizations
realize increased energy and motivation.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.2.<b>&nbsp;Fostering Growth.</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.10.2.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Leaders
foster professional growth by insisting their Airmen focus attention on the
aspects of a situation, mission, or project they control. This is not to say
tasks should be limited in scope or challenge. On the contrary, some adventure
should be an integral part of every job. In order to motivate Airmen to learn
and excel, leaders should provide challenging and enlightening experiences.
Consequently, some supervisors want to tell an Airman what to do to improve.
While this may impress the follower with the leader's knowledge, telling an
Airman what to do to improve creates an unnecessary dependence on the leader
and critically limits the follower's value of the experience.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.2.2.
The role of the leader in fostering growth is to identify and analyze knowledge
and improvement opportunities. This will ensure advancements are permanent and
pervasive, not temporary and specific. Leaders encourage the learning process
by formally recognizing individual and unit successes, no matter how large or
small. A more formal and direct way for the leader to encourage the subordinate
to learn is by setting standards. Standards have the multiple effects of
providing feedback to the leader on performance, ensuring quality control of
unit output, and giving Airmen a goal and inspiration for developing and
performing to do their best.</span></p>

<p><i><span>People want to know what is expected of them. No one goes to work
and says,  I am going to do a lousy job today.  People work to succeed, and
they need to know how you measure that success. Allow for a few mistakes
because people must be given the latitude to learn.</span></i></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.<b>&nbsp;Developing Airmen:</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1. To develop
Airmen, a leader must:</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.1. Train
replacements (the next generation).</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.2. Develop an
understanding of roles and responsibilities.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.3. Be an advisor
and mentor.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.4. Provide an
opportunity for growth and promotion.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.5. Clarify
expectations.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.6. Strengthen
service identity.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.7. Allow
Airmen to make decisions and experience leadership.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.1.8. Encourage
and facilitate formal education.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.3.2.
An important milestone in any Airman's development process is to experience a
significant challenge early in his or her career. Developing Airmen for
leadership positions requires much work over long periods of time. Identifying
people with leadership potential early in their careers and then determining
the appropriate developmental challenges for them is the first step. Leaders
must recognize and diagnose the capabilities of each Airman in their unit or
organization. Those capabilities may include any skills, talents, experiences,
personality temperaments, etc., the Airman may have that can contribute to
current and future mission accomplishment. Leaders must also diagnose the
developmental needs of Airmen, then assist them with personal and professional
developmental needs that fulfill current or future job/role and
responsibilities. Professional development needs may include off-duty
education, Professional Military Education, specific skill training, additional
training, professional development seminars/courses, and communication skills,
etc. Personal developmental needs may include relationships, interpersonal
skills, communication skills, supervisory skills, off-duty education, etc.
Today's effective leaders had opportunities early in their careers that
required them to lead, take risks, and learn from their triumphs and failures.
In business, successful corporations do not wait for leaders to come along.
Rather, they actively seek out people with leadership potential and expose them
to career experiences designed to develop their skills. However, leaders must
caution themselves against becoming preoccupied with finding and
developing&nbsp;<i>young</i>leadership potential. Leaders must guard against
overlooking the  late bloomer  whose leadership potential was not evident early
on. A late bloomer's combination of maturity, experience, and untapped
potential is a valuable asset to any organization.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.4.<b>&nbsp;Dealing with Setbacks:</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.10.4.1. To learn and
improve, people need to be encouraged to try new things; sometimes their
efforts will fail. A fundamental aspect of empowerment is acknowledging the
right to fail. Obviously, some common sense is required. There can be no
tolerance for violating regulations, jeopardizing safety, or failing due to a
lack of effort. However, if the setback is the result of a failed attempt,
applaud the initiative and dissect the setback so the Airman can learn from
what went wrong. Unfortunately, the fear of failure prevents many otherwise
capable individuals from pursuing their creativity and innovation. An Airman s
dedication to improving his or her abilities is quite a valuable asset to an
organization. Followers must remain optimistic, even in times of adversity.</span></p>

<p><span>10.10.4.2.
Some people believe the key to success is to avoid failure. Consequently, they
stay with the things they know and do well rather than risk failure by trying
something new. The surest way to stifle creativity and innovation is to allow
fear to perpetuate complacency. Airmen count on the experience and
understanding of strong leaders in dealing with setbacks. There is no
substitute for being able to say to an Airman,  I know what you re feeling,
I ve experienced similar setbacks. Here is how I chose to deal with the
situation, and these are what the consequences of my actions were. Reflecting
back on the situation, here is what I would do now if I had the chance to do
things over. </span></p>

<p><b><span>10.11. Dealing with Change:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.11.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Leaders
must be the chief transformation officers in their organizations and learn
everything there is to know about the change before dealing with the change can
even take place. Furthermore, they must learn how to deal with the emotions
that result from the chaos and fear associated with change. Putting new processes
in place is not enough. The people supporting these processes must be motivated
to meet the challenge and support the change. To achieve that, leaders must
maintain a clear understanding of the present and a clear focus on the future.</span></p>

<p><span>10.11.2.
The leader must create an organizational climate conducive to change by
explaining the limitations or shortfalls of the present process and the
possibilities and benefits of the proposed change. Next, the leader must
facilitate the change itself: walk Airmen through the change, explain the
details, and answer questions. Finally, the leader should reward those who
comply with the change and refocus those who do not. Tough-minded optimism is
the best quality a leader can demonstrate when coping with change. Leaders
coping with change should:</span></p>

<p><span>10.11.2.1. Involve
people in the change process.</span></p>

<p><span>10.11.2.2. Fully explain
the reason for change.</span></p>

<p><span>10.11.2.3. View change

<p><b><span>10.12. The Air Force Core Values.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force core values are the bedrock of leadership in the Air Force. The core
values are a statement of those institutional values and principles of conduct
that provide the moral framework within which military activities take place.
The professional Air Force ethic consists of three fundamental and enduring
values of integrity, service, and excellence. This ethic is the set of values
that guides the way Air Force members live and perform. Success hinges on the
incorporation of these values into the character of every Airman. In today s
time compressed, dynamic, and dangerous operational environment an Airman does
not have the luxury of examining each issue at leisure. He or she must fully
internalize these values to be able to automatically act in all situations to
maintain integrity, to serve others before self, and to perform with excellence
and encourage others to do the same. The Air Force core values Integrity First,
Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do represent the commitment each
Airman makes when joining the Air Force. These values provide a foundation for
leadership, decision-making, and success, whatever the level of assignment,
difficulty, or dangers presented by the mission.</span></p>

<p><i><span>All Airmen are men and women of character. Our enduring Air Force
Core Values provide a touchstone as we rise to meet current and future challenges,
threats, and opportunities. As America's Airmen, it is imperative that we
maintain the moral high ground</span></i><span> <i>our Nation depends on it.</i></span></p>

<p align="center"><span>Michael W. Wynne&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Former Secretary of the Air Force<i>&nbsp;Core Values help those
who join us to understand right from the outset what's expected of them.
Equally important, they provide all of us, from Airman to four-star general,
with a touchstone a guide in our own conscience to remind us of what we expect
from ourselves. We have wonderful people in the Air Force. But we aren t
perfect. Frequent reflection on the core values helps each of us refocus on the
person we want to be and the example we want to set.</i></span></p>

<p><span>General
Michael E. Ryan, Retired Former Air Force Chief of Staff</span></p>

<p><span>10.12.1.<b>&nbsp;Integrity First.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Integrity
is the willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking. Integrity
is the "moral compass," the inner voice, the voice of self-control,
and the basis for the trust imperative in today's Air Force. Integrity is the
single most important part of character. Integrity makes Airmen who they are
and what they stand for, and is as much a part of their professional reputation
as their ability to fly or fix jets, operate the computer network, repair the
runway, or defend the airbase. Airmen must be professional, in and out of
uniform. Integrity is not a suit that can be taken off at night or on the
weekend or worn only when important to look good. Instead, what makes integrity
critical is when we least expect to be tested. People are watching us, not to
see us fail but to see us live up to their expectations; anything less risks
putting the heritage and reputation of the Air Force in peril. Integrity is the
ability to hold together and properly regulate all the elements of one s
personality. A person of integrity acts on conviction, demonstrating impeccable
self-control without acting rashly. Integrity encompasses many characteristics
indispensable to Airmen.</span></p>

<p><i><span>There will be demands upon your ability, upon your endurance, upon
your disposition, upon your patience just as fire tempers iron into fine steel
so does adversity temper one's character into firmness, tolerance and
determination.</span></i></p>

<p><span>Senator Margaret Chase
Smith, Lieutenant Colonel U.S. Air Force Reserve</span></p>

<p><span>10.12.2.<b>&nbsp;Service before Self:</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.12<b>.</b>2.1.
As an Air Force core value, service before self represents an abiding
dedication to the age-old military virtue of selfless dedication to duty,
including putting one's life at risk if called to do so. The
service-before-self value deals with accepting expeditionary deployments and assignments.
Service before self does not mean service before family. Airmen have a duty to
their families just as strong as that to the service. The difference is there
are times when service to the nation requires subordinating the needs of the
family. Their responsibilities to their families include ensuring they are
cared for when Airmen are home or deployed.</span></p>

<p><span>10.12<b>.</b>2.2.
This value also demands that each Airman keep faith in the system. This does
not imply that we follow our leaders blindly and not sometimes question what we
are doing. Airmen must always place trust in the processes, procedures, and
other Airmen to get the job done in the right way. Airmen must understand that
an organization can only achieve excellence in an atmosphere free from fear, unlawful
discrimination, sexual harassment, intimidation, hazing, or unfair treatment.
Airmen must show loyalty to their leadership, fellow Airmen, and the Air Force
as a whole, including showing commitment to the Constitution, military chain of
command, and to both the President and Secretary of Defense.</span></p>

<p><i><span>I have been recognized as a hero for my ten minutes of action over
Vietnam, but I am no more a hero than anyone else who has served this country.</span></i></p>

John L. Levitow, lowest-ranking Air Force Medal of Honor Recipient</span></p>

<p><span>10.12.3.<b>&nbsp;Excellence In All We Do:</b></span></p>

<p><span>10.12.3.1.
This core value demands Airmen constantly strive to perform at their best. They
should always strive to exceed standards objectively based on mission needs.
This demands a continuous search for new and innovative ways to accomplish the
mission without jeopardizing morale and loyalty.</span></p>

<p><span>10.12.3.2.
Personally, Airmen seek out and complete developmental education. They
constantly work hard to stay in their best physical, mental, emotional,
spiritual, and moral shape. Airmen continue to enhance their professional
competencies and are diligent to maintain their job skills, knowledge, and
personal readiness at the highest possible levels. They understand that when
members of an organization work together to successfully reach a common goal,
excellence is achieved and no Airman wins the fight alone. Each organization
must foster a culture that emphasizes a team mentality while simultaneously
maintaining standards and accomplishing the mission. Realizing that people are
our most precious resource, Airmen are responsible for ensuring they are
trained, fit, focused, and ready to accomplish the mission safely and
effectively.</span></p>

is overwhelming. It is always in demand and nobody cares about its color.</span></i></p>

<p><span>10.12.4.&nbsp;<b>Air Force Viewpoint.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force recognizes these core values as universal and unchanging in the
profession of arms. They provide the standards used to evaluate the ethical
climate of all Air Force organizations. Finally, when needed in the cauldron of
war, they are the beacons that light the path of professional conduct and the
highest ideals of integrity, service, and excellence.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 10C Followership
and Mentoring</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.13. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Preoccupation
with leadership often prevents us from considering the nature and importance of
followership. At some point, everyone is a follower. Few leaders became
successful without first having learned followership skills. Therefore, leaders
must recognize the importance and qualities of followership, the needs of
followers, and ways to promote followership.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.14. Importance of Followership.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Today s
leader has the almost impossible task of keeping up with ever-changing technology
while coping with leadership demands. In many cases, the leader is not the most
technically skilled person in the unit. He or she likely has personnel with
advanced technological skills and capabilities. People are our most valuable
resource. Today's junior members have knowledge, skills, and abilities that
open unlimited opportunities to maximize work center effectiveness. Therefore,
leaders must tap into this resource by nurturing and developing their Airmen s
capabilities and fostering their willingness to improve organizational
effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.15. Qualities of Followership.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The following 10
qualities are essential for good followership. However, this list is neither
inflexible nor exhaustive:</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.1.<b>&nbsp;Organizational Understanding.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Effective followers must
be able to see how their work contributes to the organization's big picture.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.2.<b>&nbsp;Decision-making.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Followers must be able
to make sound decisions using a team approach.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.3.<b>&nbsp;Communication Skills.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Followers must have
effective communication skills. These skills are crucial when working in a team
environment, especially when providing feedback to team members.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.4.<b>&nbsp;Commitment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Being able to
successfully contribute to the organization, while striving to achieve personal
goals, requires a strong level of follower commitment.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.5.<b>&nbsp;Problem Solving.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A broader scope of
responsibility to help identify and resolve work center problems requires
followers to share their knowledge, skills, and experience.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.6.<b>&nbsp;Integrity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Followers must
demonstrate loyalty and a willingness to act according to accepted beliefs.
Integrity requires one to identify and be true to values.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.7.<b>&nbsp;Adaptability.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Ever-changing roles,
missions, and systems require followers to be adaptable to change without being
paralyzed by the stress of not knowing all the answers.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.8.<b>&nbsp;Self-Employment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Followers must take
responsibility for their own careers, actions, and development.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.9.<b>&nbsp;Courage.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Followers must have the
confidence and guts to do and say the right things at the right times.</span></p>

<p><span>10.15.10.<b>&nbsp;Credibility.</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><span>By demonstrating
competency in their words and deeds, followers earn trust and an honorable
reputation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.16. Follower Needs.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Successful leaders must devote attention to what their Airmen want
and expect. Otherwise, leaders may lose the opportunity to capitalize on their
talents or lose their Airmen's respect. Followers need to know they can count
on their leaders when the going gets tough. Furthermore, respect is a two-way
street; followers also want to be respected. Followers treated as if they are
not important, or who perceive that they are not important, lose their
willingness and desire to perform. Leaders demonstrate belief in their Airmen
by: (1) maintaining or enhancing their Airmen's self-esteem; (2) listening
carefully to their Airmen and responding with empathy; and (3) asking for their
Airmen's help and encouraging their involvement. A few moments of sincerity and
thoughtfulness go a long way toward satisfying Airmen's basic needs.</span></p>

<p><span>Followers perform best
when they want to be in a unit, not when they are trapped in the unit.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.17. Ways to Promote Followership.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Empowered
followership, like motivation, requires a joint effort between leaders and the
individuals they lead. This effort must be continuously promoted. Leaders must
listen and respond to the ideas and needs of their followers, and followers are
similarly required to listen and respond to the ideas and needs of their
leaders. Mutual trust is the axis around which this synergistic relationship
revolves; the benefits reaped are plentiful. Team requirements are best served
when the leader helps followers develop their own initiatives, encourages them
to use their own judgment, and allows them to grow and become more effective
communicators. As a result of promoting empowered followership, follower skills
such as troubleshooting, problem solving, information gathering, conflict
resolution, and change management will improve dramatically. Another way to
promote empowered followership is by getting out among the Airmen and sharing
their interests. Airmen respond to leaders who show sincere interest in them.
The success of great leaders depends on their ability to establish a base of
loyal, capable, and knowledgeable followers.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.18. Mentor Defined.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A
mentor is a trusted counselor or guide. Mentoring, therefore, is a relationship
in which a person with greater experience and wisdom guides another person to
develop both personally and professionally. The long-term health of the Air
Force depends upon the experienced member developing the next in line. Air
Force mentoring is governed by AFMAN 36-2643,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Mentoring
Program</i>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.19. Mentoring Scope:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.19.1.
Mentoring helps prepare people for the increased responsibilities they will
assume as they progress in their careers. Mentoring is not a promotion
enhancement program; mentoring is an ongoing process and not confined to the
formal feedback required by AFI 36-2406,<i>&nbsp;Officer and Enlisted
Evaluation Systems</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>and AFI 36-1001,&nbsp;<i>Managing the Civilian
Performance Program.</i>&nbsp;Moreover, mentoring is a professional development
program designed to help each individual reach his or her maximum potential.
Professional development is not a new concept and occurs at every echelon and
activity. AFI 36-2909,&nbsp;<i>Professional and Unprofessional Relationships,</i>&nbsp;and
AFI 36-703,&nbsp;<i>Civilian Conduct and Responsibility</i>, explains the
standards regarding professional relationships. In particular, mentoring is
part of a professional relationship because mentoring fosters communication
between subordinates and supervisors concerning careers, performance, duties,
and missions. Finally, mentoring enhances morale and discipline and improves
the operational environment while maintaining respect for authority.</span></p>

<p><span>10.19.2.
Air Force mentoring covers a wide range of areas, such as career guidance,
technical and professional development, leadership, Air Force history and
heritage, air and space power doctrine, strategic vision, and contributions to
joint warfighting. Therefore, Air Force mentoring includes knowledge of the
military ethics and an understanding of the Air Force's core values: Integrity
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.</span></p>

<p><span>10.19.3.
Commanders and supervisors must encourage Airmen to read and comprehend air and
space power literature, such as Air Force doctrine and operational warfighting
publications and the books in the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Professional
Reading Program.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.20. Assignment of Mentors:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.20.1. The immediate
supervisor or rater is the primary mentor (coach, counselor, guide, role model)
for each of his or her Airmen. This designation in no way restricts the
subordinate's desire to seek additional counseling and professional development
advice from other sources or mentors. Supervisors and commanders must make
themselves available to Airmen who seek career guidance and counsel.</span></p>

<p><span>10.20.2.
Key to the mentoring process is direct involvement by the commander and
supervisor. Commanders and supervisors must continually challenge their Airmen
to improve. They must provide clear performance feedback and guidance in
setting realistic near-, mid-, and long-term professional and personal
development goals.</span></p>

<p><span>10.20.3.
Several programs exist to help the commander and supervisor focus attention on
an Airman's professional development. Among these are performance feedback,
PME, academic education opportunities, assignment policies, recognition
programs, and the individual's own personal development actions. Additionally,
many organizations, programs, and associations are dedicated to the advancement
and education of military professionals. The first sergeant, base education
center, and Airman and Family Readiness Center can provide lists and contact
information for organizations that support military development. Leaders should
also ensure that Airmen are aware of specific tools available to them such as
MyVector which enables web based mentoring, career planning, and knowledge
sharing.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.21. Mentoring Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air
Force leaders have an inherent responsibility to mentor future leaders.
Supervisors must take an active role in their Airmen's professional
development. They must assist their people by providing realistic evaluations
of both performance and potential. Supervisors must also be positive role
models. At minimum, mentoring consists of a discussion of performance,
potential, and professional development plans during the performance feedback
session. The feedback should include promotion, PME, advanced degree work,
physical fitness, personal goals and expectations, professional qualities, next
assignment, and long-range plans, at minimum. Mentors must distinguish between
individual goals, career aspirations, and realistic expectations. Each
individual defines a successful career differently. There are numerous paths to
meet individual career and success goals. Foremost, however, individuals must
focus on Air Force institutional needs. The Air Force must develop people
skilled in the employment and support of air and space power and how this meets
national security needs. While there is nothing wrong with lofty goals, mentors
must ensure personnel realize what high but achievable goals are.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.22. Professional Military Education and
Academic Education.</span></b></p>

<p><span>PME
and academic education enhance performance in each phase of professional
development and build on the foundation of leadership abilities shown during
the earlier stages of an individual's career. The role of PME in professional
development is to prepare individuals to take on increased responsibilities
appropriate to their grade and to enhance their contribution to the Air Force.
Members should focus on enhancing professional competence and becoming superior
leaders, while expanding their operational employment of air, space, and
cyberspace power knowledge. Post-secondary degrees (associate, bachelor s,
master s, or other advanced academic degrees) are important to professional
development to the extent that they enhance the degree holder's job and
professional qualifications. A degree directly related to an individual s
primary specialty area or occupational series is most appropriate because this
type of degree adds to his or her depth of knowledge. This is why senior
noncommissioned officers are required to complete the Senior Noncommissioned
Officer Academy by correspondence or in residence and obtain a Community
College of the Air Force degree (any specialty) to receive a senior rater
endorsement on their performance reports. (<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;This requirement
is the minimum criteria for endorsement consideration and does not guarantee
automatic endorsement.) A master's or doctorate degree in management or more
general studies enhances job performance for personnel reaching the highest
grade levels, where duties may require broader managerial skills. In some career
fields, advanced formal education is a prerequisite for certain jobs.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><b><span>10.23. Professional Associations.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Many
private organizations develop professional skills and associations for
individuals in many career fields and technical specialties. Membership in such
associations may provide additional opportunities for mentoring as well as
broaden technical expertise. Most Air Force bases have private organizations
for each rank tier (for example, Top III (Master Sergeant-Chief Master
Sergeant)).</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.24. Evaluation and Performance Feedback.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air
Force evaluation systems are designed to accurately appraise performance.
Substantive, formal feedback is essential to the effectiveness of the
evaluation systems. Performance evaluation systems are an integral part of
mentoring and professional development. Performance feedback is designed to
provide a realistic assessment of performance, career standing, future
potential, and actions required to help the ratee reach the next level of
professional development.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.25. Promotion Selection.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Weighted Airman
Promotion System outlines the requirements for promotion selection (Staff
Sergeant through Master Sergeant) and provides feedback score sheets to
enlisted members considered for promotion. These score sheets help the
individual to determine professional development needs. Selection for promotion
to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant is accomplished using an
integrated weighted and central selection board system. In addition to the
weighted score, the central selection board evaluates each individual using the
 whole person concept.  Board scores are determined by considering performance,
leadership, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence,
specific achievements, and education. The board score is added to the weighted
score to determine order of merit for promotion.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.26. The Military Assignment System.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
mentor and the individual should both focus on obtaining an assignment that
enhances professional development and meets Air Force needs without necessarily
keying on a specific position or location. The individual is expected to do
well in his or her current assignment. When an individual becomes eligible for
reassignment, he or she should address assignment preferences with their
supervisor. Assignments should complement the individual's professional
development needs and be second only to mission requirements. Supervisors can
use the career field education and training plan to help develop career path
guidance.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.27. Recognition, Awards, and Decorations<i>.</i></span></b></p>

<p><span>Military
members are eligible for consideration for various decorations throughout their
careers. However, supervisors should not submit recommendations just to  do
something for their people.  Supervisors should restrict recommendations to
recognitions of meritorious service, outstanding achievement, etc., that
clearly place the individual above his or her peers.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section
10D Developmental Counseling</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.28. Airman Development.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airman
leadership development is one of the most important responsibilities of every
Air Force leader. Developing future leaders should be one of the highest
priorities of a leader. The future of the Air Force rests on the shoulders of
those prepared for greater responsibility.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.29. Purpose.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Developmental
counseling is a shared effort. Leaders assist Airmen in identifying strengths
and weaknesses and creating plans of action. Leaders then support them
throughout the plan implementation and assessment. However, to achieve success,
Airmen must be forthright in their commitment to improve and candid in their
own assessment and goal setting.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.30. Leader Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Leaders
coach Airmen the same way athletic coaches improve their teams: by identifying
weaknesses, setting goals, developing and implementing plans of action, and
providing oversight and motivation throughout the process. Effective coaches or
leaders must thoroughly understand the strengths, weaknesses, and professional
goals of their Airmen. Air Force leaders conduct counseling to help Airmen
become better members of the team, maintain or improve performance, and prepare
for the future. To conduct effective counseling, leaders should develop a
counseling style using the characteristics listed in Figure 10.2. This approach
is very similar to the art of leadership coaching. Coaching is a growing field
in the Air Force. The Air Force Academy can provide more information about
coaching as they have a new Mosaic Coaching Program. An overview of this
program is available at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.usafa.edu/Commandant/cwc/cwcs/docs/Mosiac_Coaching/Mosaic_Coaching_Description.pdf"><span>http://www.usafa.edu</span></a><a href="http://www.usafa.edu/Commandant/cwc/cwcs/docs/Mosiac_Coaching/Mosaic_Coaching_Description.pdf"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.31. The Leader as a Counselor.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force leaders must
demonstrate certain qualities to be effective counselors. These qualities
include respect for Airmen, self-awareness, cultural awareness, empathy, and
credibility.</span></p>

<p><span>10.31.1.<b>&nbsp;Respect for Airmen.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Allowing
Airmen to take responsibility for their own ideas and actions is a show or
respect and helps create mutual respect in the leader-subordinate relationship.
Mutual respect improves the chances of changing or maintaining behavior and
achieving goals.</span></p>

<p><span>10.31.2.<b>&nbsp;Self-Awareness.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Leaders
must be fully aware of their own values, needs, and biases before counseling
Airmen. Self-aware leaders are less likely to project their biases onto Airmen.
Also, aware leaders are more likely to act consistently with their own values
and actions. 10.31.3.<b>&nbsp;Cultural Awareness.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Leaders
need to be aware of the similarities and differences between individuals of
different cultural backgrounds and how these factors may influence values,
perspectives, and actions. Unfamiliarity with cultural backgrounds may hinder
leaders in addressing cultural issues, especially if they generate concerns
within the organization or hinder team-building. Cultural awareness enhances a
leader's ability to display empathy.</span></p>

<p><span>10.31.4.<b>&nbsp;Empathy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Empathy
is to be understanding of and sensitive to another person's feelings, thoughts,
and experiences to the point that you can almost feel or experience them
yourself. Leaders with empathy can put themselves in their Airman's shoes and
see a situation from the other person's perspective. Understanding the Airman s
position can help the Airman develop a plan of action that fits his or her
personality and needs one that works for the Airman. Not fully comprehending a
situation from the Airman's point of view gives a leader less credibility and
influence. As a result, the Airman is less likely to commit to the agreed-upon
plan of action.</span></p>

<p><span>10.31.5.<b>&nbsp;Credibility</b>.</span></p>

<p><span>Leaders
achieve credibility by being honest and consistent in their statements and
actions. Using a straightforward style and behaving in a manner that Airmen
respect and trust makes a leader credible. Leaders can earn credibility by
repeatedly demonstrating a willingness to assist and being consistent in what
they say and do. To influence Airmen without credibility is difficult.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.32. Leader Counseling Skills.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Leaders
should seek to develop and improve their own counseling abilities. The
techniques needed to provide effective counseling vary from person to person
and session to session. However, general skills needed in almost every
situation include active listening, responding, and questioning.</span></p>

<p><span>10.32.1.<b>&nbsp;Active Listening.</b></span></p>

<p><span>During
counseling, leaders must actively listen. By actively listening, leaders
communicate verbally and nonverbally that they have received the message. To
learn more about active listening, refer to Chapter 14,&nbsp;<i>Communicating
in Today's Air Force</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>10.32.2.<b>&nbsp;Responding.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
leader responds both verbally and nonverbally to communicate understanding and
to clarify and confirm what has been said. Verbal responses consist of
summarizing, interpreting, and clarifying the message. Nonverbal responses
include eye contact and occasional gestures such as a head nod.</span></p>

<p><span>10.32.3.<b>&nbsp;Questioning.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Although
questioning is a necessary skill, use this skill with caution. Too many
questions can aggravate the power differential between a leader and an Airman
and place the Airman in a passive mode. The Airman may also react to excessive
questioning as an intrusion of privacy and become defensive. During a
leadership development review, ask questions to obtain information or to get
the Airman to think about a particular situation. Generally, questions should
be open-ended to evoke more than a  yes-or-no  answer. Well-posed questions may
help to verify understanding, encourage further explanation, or help the Airman
move through the stages of the counseling session.</span></p>



<p><b><span>10.33. Types of Developmental Counseling.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Developmental counseling
can be categorized based on the topic of the session. Event-oriented counseling
and performance and professional growth counseling are the two major categories
of counseling.</span></p>

<p><span>10.33.1.<b>&nbsp;Event-Oriented Counseling.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Event-oriented
counseling involves a specific event or situation and may precede events such
as applying for a special duty assignment or attending a school. This type of
counseling may follow events such as a noteworthy duty performance, a problem
with performance or mission accomplishment, or a personal problem.
Event-oriented counseling includes, but is not limited to:</span></p>

<p><span>10.33.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Counseling
for Specific Instances.</b>&nbsp;Sometimes counseling is connected to specific
instances of superior or substandard duty performance or behavior. Leaders must
tell Airmen whether or not their performance met the standard and what they did
right or wrong (e.g. performance feedback counseling). The key to successful
counseling for specific performance is to conduct the counseling as close to
the event as possible. Leaders should counsel Airmen for specific examples of
superior as well as substandard duty performance.</span></p>

<p><span>10.33.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Crisis
Counseling.</b>&nbsp;Leaders may conduct crisis counseling to get an Airman
through the initial shock after receiving negative news, such as notification
of the death of a loved one. Listening and, as appropriate, providing
assistance may greatly assist the Airman dealing with a crisis.</span></p>

<p><span>10.33.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Referral
Counseling.</b>&nbsp;Referral counseling helps Airmen work through a personal
situation and may or may not follow crisis counseling. Referral counseling may
also act as preventive counseling before the situation becomes a problem.
Usually, the leader assists the Airman in identifying the problem and refers
the subordinate to the appropriate resource, such as legal services, a
chaplain, or an alcohol and drug counselor.</span></p>

<p><span>10.33.2.<b>&nbsp;Performance and Professional
Growth Counseling.</b></span></p>

<p><span>During
performance and professional growth counseling, conduct a review of an Airman s
duty performance during a certain period and set standards for the next period.
Rather than dwelling on the past, focus the session on the Airman's strengths,
areas needing improvement, and potential.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.34. Approaches to Counseling.</span></b></p>

<p><span>An effective leader approaches each Airman as an individual.
Different people and different situations require different counseling
approaches. Three approaches to counseling include nondirective, directive, and
combined. These approaches differ in the techniques used, but they all fit the
definition of counseling and contribute to the overall purpose. The major
difference between the approaches is the degree to which the Airman
participates and interacts during a counseling session.</span></p>

<p><span>Figure 10.3 summarizes
the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</span></p>

<p><span>10.34.1.<b>&nbsp;Nondirective.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
nondirective approach is preferred for most counseling sessions. During the
counseling session, listen rather than make decisions or give advice. Clarify
what is said. Cause the Airman to bring out important points to better
understand the situation. When appropriate, summarize the discussion. Avoid
providing solutions or rendering opinions; instead, maintain a focus on
individual and organizational goals and objectives. Ensure the Airman's plan of
action supports those goals and objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>10.34.2.<b>&nbsp;Directive.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
directive approach works best to correct simple problems, make on-the-spot
corrections, and correct aspects of duty performance. The leader using the
directive style does most of the talking and tells the Airman what and when of
doing something. In contrast to the nondirective approach, the leader directs a
course of action for the Airman. Choose this approach when time is short, when
you alone know what to do, or if an Airman has limited problemsolving skills.
Finally, directive is appropriate when an Airman is immature, insecure, or
needs guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>10.34.3.<b>&nbsp;Combined.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In
the combined approach, the leader uses techniques from both the directive and
nondirective approaches, adjusting them to articulate what is best for the
Airman. The combined approach emphasizes the Airman's planning and
decision-making responsibilities. With your assistance, the Airman develops a
plan of action. Listen, suggest possible courses, and help analyze each
possible solution to determine the good and bad points. Then help the Airman
fully understand all aspects of the situation and encourage the Airman to
decide which solution is best.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.35. The Counseling Process.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The four stages of the
counseling process are identify the need for counseling, prepare for
counseling, conduct the counseling session, and follow up.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.1.<b>&nbsp;Identify the Need for
Counseling.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Conduct
developmental counseling whenever the need arises for focused, two-way
communication aimed at Airman development. Developing Airmen consists of
observing their performance, comparing performance to the standard, and then
providing them feedback in the form of counseling.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.2.<b>&nbsp;Prepare for Counseling.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Successful counseling
requires preparation. To prepare for counseling:</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Select
a Suitable Place.</b>&nbsp;When scheduling counseling, consider an environment
with minimal interruptions and free from distractions.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Schedule
the Time.</b>&nbsp;When possible, counsel an Airman during the duty day.
Counseling after duty hours may be rushed or perceived as unfavorable. The
length of time required for counseling depends on the complexity of the issue.
Generally, a counseling session should last less than 1 hour. If you need more
time, schedule a second session.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Notify
the Airman well in Advance.</b>&nbsp;The Airman should know why, where, and
when the counseling session will take place. Counseling following a specific
event should happen as close to the event as possible.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Organize
the Pertinent Information.</b>&nbsp;Solid preparation is essential to effective
counseling. Review all pertinent information including the purpose of the
counseling, facts and observations about the Airman, identification of possible
problems, main points of discussion, and the development of a plan of action.
Focus on specific and objective behaviors the Airman must maintain or improve
upon as well as a plan of action with clear, obtainable goals.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Plan
the Counseling Approach.&nbsp;</b>There are as many approaches to counseling as
there are leaders. The directive, nondirective, and combined approaches to
counseling were addressed earlier. Use a strategy that suits the Airman and the
situation.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.2.6.&nbsp;<b>Establish
the Right Atmosphere.</b>&nbsp;The right atmosphere promotes two-way communication
between a leader and Airman. To establish a relaxed atmosphere, offer the
Airman a seat or something to drink. Sit in a chair facing the Airman rather
than behind a desk because a desk can be perceived as a barrier. Some
situations, however, make an informal atmosphere inappropriate. For example, a
more formal atmosphere is normally used to give specific guidance and
reinforces the leader's rank, position, and authority.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.3.&nbsp;<b>Conduct the Counseling Session.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Be
flexible when conducting a counseling session. Often, counseling for a specific
incident occurs spontaneously as leaders encounter Airmen in their daily
activities. Good leaders take advantage of naturally occurring events to
provide Airmen with feedback. Even when you have not prepared for formal
counseling, you should follow the four basic components of a counseling
session:</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Open
the Counseling Session.</b>&nbsp;The best way to open a counseling session is
to clearly state the purpose. Establish the preferred setting early in the
session by inviting the Airman to speak.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Discuss
the Issues.&nbsp;</b>Attempt to develop a mutual understanding of the issues
with the Airman. This is best developed by letting the Airman do most of the
talking. Use active listening; respond and question without dominating the
conversation. Aim to help the Airman better understand the subject of the
counseling, such as duty performance, a problem situation and the impact, or
potential areas for growth. Both you and the Airman should provide examples or
cite specific observations to reduce the perception that is unnecessarily
biased or judgmental. However, when the issue is substandard performance, make
it clear how the performance did not meet the standard and then develop a plan
of action.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.3.3.<b>&nbsp;Develop
a Plan of Action.&nbsp;</b>A plan of action identifies a method for achieving a
desired result and specifies what the Airman must do to reach the goals set
during the counseling session. The plan of action must be specific. The plan of
action should show the Airman how to modify or maintain his or her behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.3.4.<b>&nbsp;Record
and Close the Session.&nbsp;</b>Documentation serves as a reference to the
agreed-upon plan of action and the Airman's accomplishments, improvements,
personal preferences, or problems. To close the session, summarize key points
and ask if the Airman understands the plan of action. Invite the Airman to
review the plan of action and what you, as the leader, expect from him or her.
With the Airman, establish any follow-up measures necessary to support the successful
implementation of the plan of action. These may include providing the Airman
with resources and time, periodically assessing the plan, and following through
on referrals. Schedule any future meetings, at least tentatively, before
dismissing the Airman.</span></p>

<p><span>10.35.4.&nbsp;<b>Follow up.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
counseling process does not end with the counseling session. Follow up
continues through implementation of the plan of action and evaluation of
results. After counseling, support the Airman as he or she implements the plan
of action. Support may include teaching, coaching, or providing time and
resources. Observe and assess this process and possibly modify the plan to meet
goals. Appropriate measures after counseling include follow-up counseling,
making referrals, informing the chain of command, and taking corrective
measures.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.36. Leveraging Diversity.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Our
work environment today is more diverse than ever. The Air Force team is
comprised of military, civilians, and contractors. Leaders can find themselves
dealing with a workforce ranging from 18-year-olds to those with 18 or more
years of experience. The challenge is to incorporate everyone's specific
talents into a cohesive and optimal workforce. We must recognize that people
are vital to an organization's success. Consequently, we need to understand the
motivations and interests of this diverse workforce.</span></p>

<p><span>10.36.1.
People are motivated for their reasons, not yours. What sparks interest and
passion in one person does not necessarily ignite the next person. Effective
leaders take time to recognize what excites others, leverages their talent to
the organization, and cultivate a work culture that recognizes and appreciates
differing perspectives and approaches to solving problems. Consider this: the
Air Force attracts people from every aspect of society, culture, and social
status. When, where, and how someone was raised impacts their value system.
None of these variables are under a supervisor's direct control. Supervisors
cannot change someone's inherent characteristics, but they can change how to
lead these people as a cohesive team. Foremost, leaders must create a
hospitable climate that promotes respect and inclusion. This will reduce
dysfunctional tension and increase team productivity. Specifically, how can
this be achieved?</span></p>

<p><span>10.36.2.
The first step in leading a diverse organization is to form common ground or a
shared set of assumptions, which will form the framework within to communicate.
The common ground is the organization itself, the vision, goals, rules,
regulations, processes, and procedures that govern what the unit does to
achieve mission requirements. Clear guidelines improve communication, reduce
confusion, provide purpose, and define desired outcomes. A team must have a
clear sense of direction or else there will be mass confusion with everyone
going in different directions.</span></p>

<p><span>10.36.3.
Having established common ground, we must increase awareness and expel
stereotypes. Examples include younger employees are  wet behind the ears,  know
nothing, have no respect or loyalty, lack experience, have no credibility, and
cannot be trusted with much responsibility. At the other end of the social
spectrum, older employees are considered less motivated to work hard, are
nothing but deadwood, resistant to change, cannot learn new methods/technology,
plateau at 40, should be fired after 50, and are  fire proof.  Stereotypes
ignore differences among the individuals in a group. The workplace has no room
for such stereotypes. Instead, leaders must acknowledge the richness and benefits
of diversity.</span></p>

<p><span>10.36.4.
People are different. There is no way to make them fit into a single mold, nor
is there any reason to. We do not live in a world of carbon-copied people. To
effectively manage a diverse workforce, we must acknowledge differences. However,
we should focus more on what we have in common.</span></p>

<p><span>10.36.5.
Use everyone's experiences and background as a resource. Diversity of
experience and background ensures diverse ways of looking at problems. Managing
our workforce diversity can result in higher productivity, improved
performance, more creativity, more innovations, and reduced stress. Giving
emphasis to diversity without threatening our unity is the proper way to
strengthen the ties that bind the team together. Sensitivity, mutual respect,
and common trust coupled with communication are the prime ingredients to
integrating our Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>10.36.6.
Former Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, General John P. Jumper stated,  Air
Force diversity is a critical warfighting and readiness issue. Maximizing the benefits
of diversity is a mission imperative. We expect Air Force leaders to challenge
any policy, practice, or process that limits the growth and development of
potential leaders from all groups.  Industry studies have consistently revealed
that heterogeneous or diverse groups are more innovative than homogeneous
groups because they view improvement opportunities from multiple perspectives.
Managing diversity is determining which differences matter in enriching a
product or service. Productivity is an outcome of respect and inclusion. Former
Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, General Ronald Fogleman said,  People are the
assets that determine our success or failure. If you are to be a good leader,
you have to cultivate your skills in the arena of personal relations.  The
skilled leader deals effectively with all races, nationalities, cultures,
disabilities, ages, and gender.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 10E Full Range
Leadership Development (FRLD)</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.37. Full Range Leadership Development.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A
full range of leadership behaviors is essential in today's complex world.
Therefore, developing full range leadership potential throughout the workforce
has become a principal initiative in several of today's most successful
organizations, to include the U.S. Air Force. Though the leadership theories of
the past were very successful, today's Air Force depends on highly effective
Airmen with the flexibility and capability to operate throughout a spectrum of
leadership styles. FRLD was adopted because the best parts of past leadership
theories are combined.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.1.
FRLD is unique and requires us to view leadership as a system made up of three
core elements: the leader, the follower, and the situation. The components of
the FRLD system are interdependent of one another. Its success relies not only
on the leader's actions, but also the follower and the situation. FRLD requires
today's leaders to consider the follower and each situation and be willing to:</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.1.1. Develop
relationships with leadership, peers, and subordinates.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.1.2. Take advantage
of opportunities as they come available.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.1.3. Efficiently
use available resources.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.1.4. Properly
evaluate situations and the performance of followers.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.1.5. Reward
appropriately (and discipline accordingly).</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.1.6. Identify
improvement areas in one's self, their followers, and the work place.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2. The FRLD Model
(Figure 10.4) includes five leadership behaviors ranging from the passive, less
effective Laissez-Faire behavior to the more active and effective
Transformational Leadership behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Laissez-Faire.&nbsp;</b>Laissez-faire
leaders view the development and needs of their subordinates as someone else s
concern. They tend to pass on and abandon their responsibilities and remain
indifferent toward important issues. They are hesitant to make decisions and
are usually absent from their place of work, which negatively affects
relationships with peers and subordinates.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Management by Exception-Passive.&nbsp;</b>This
leadership behavior is the&nbsp;<i> if it isn t broke, don t fix it </i>&nbsp;leadership
style. Here, leaders elect to sit back, observe, and wait for things to go
wrong before taking action. They intervene only when policies or rules are
broken. Management by Exception-Passive is a little more effective than
Laissez-Faire because subordinates know that leadership will hold them
accountable if they fail to meet standards of performance or comply with
policies and procedures.</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="566" height="425" src="afh1_files/image232.png" ></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Management
by Exception-Active.&nbsp;</b>This leadership behavior ensures leaders keep
personnel and processes in control. They monitor and govern subordinates
through forced compliance with rules, regulations, and expectations for meeting
performance standards. Management by Exception-Active exists in a structured
system with detailed instructions, careful observation, and very&nbsp;<i>active</i>&nbsp;supervision.
Furthermore, this leadership behavior reduces organizational uncertainties,
avoids unnecessary risks, and ensures important goals are being achieved. This
transactional leadership behavior reduces the temptation for employees to avoid
their duties or act unethically and aids members in meeting defined performance
objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Transactional
Leadership and Contingent Rewards.&nbsp;</b>Transactional leadership and
contingent rewards involve the constructive&nbsp;<i>transaction</i>&nbsp;between
a leader and his or her followers. These transactions are  contracts' where the
leader sets goals, identifies ways for the subordinate to reach these goals,
and supports the follower along the way. The follower is then required to
perform their assigned tasks to a specified performance level and, when they
achieve their leader's expectations, the leader reinforces the positive
behavior by providing a reward. In other words, the reward is contingent upon
the follower performing assigned tasks to expectations.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Transformational
Leadership.</b>&nbsp;The transformational leader offers followers a vision and
inspires their mission. This type of leadership inspires followers to exceed
their goals and promotes positive, meaningful changes. There are four
components of transformational leadership, called the&nbsp;<i>4 I s</i>:
Individualized Consideration, Intellectual Stimulation, Idealized Influence,
and Inspirational Motivation.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Individualized
Consideration (<i>Nurturing</i>).&nbsp;</b>Individualized consideration is
where leaders treat their followers as individuals with different needs,
abilities, and aspirations and not just as a part of a group of subordinates.
They empathize with and support each follower while maintaining healthy
communication. Using Individualized Consideration, leaders  nurture  followers
by acting as mentor or coach.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Intellectual
Stimulation (<i>Thinking</i>).&nbsp;</b>Intellectual Stimulation is the degree
to which a leader values their subordinates' rationality and intellect, seeking
different perspectives and considering opposing points of view. Using
Intellectual Stimulation, leaders stimulate and encourage creativity in their
followers, encourage followers to be independent thinkers, and are not afraid
to take risks and solicit ideas from their followers.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.5.3.&nbsp;<b>Inspirational
Motivation (<i>Charming</i>).&nbsp;</b>This leader behavior involves developing
and articulating visions that paint an optimistic and enthusiastic picture of
the future that is appealing and inspiring to followers. These visions elevate
performance expectations and inspire followers to put forth extra effort to
achieve the leader's vision.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.2.5.4.&nbsp;<b>Idealized
Influence (<i>Influencing</i>).&nbsp;</b>Transformational leaders are
charismatic and act as positive role models that  walk the walk.  They exhibit
high levels of moral behavior, virtues, and character strengths, as well as a
strong work ethic. They represent the organization's values, beliefs, and
purpose in both words and actions. They set aside personal interests for the
sake of the group.</span></p>

<p><span>10.37.3.
Developing these five leadership behaviors begins by understanding each of them
and knowing when, or when not, to apply them. In addition, possessing the
flexibility and capability to implement each style is critical to successfully
leading others, depending on the follower and the situation. Though a more
passive approach may be appropriate at times, transformational leaders actively
and effectively develop the followers today to become the leaders of tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 10F Mentorship</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.38.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Essential Principles.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Mentoring
is a leadership obligation and responsibility. Through mentoring, senior
leaders pass on their experience and wisdom to junior members as well as
philosophy, traditions, shared values, quality, and lessons learned. Mentoring
provides the framework for the professional development of competent, future
Air Force leaders. Mentoring is an ongoing process and perhaps the most
powerful method leadership can use to shape the future. A mentor is a trusted
advisor, teacher, counselor, friend, parent, and/or the more senior person in
the relationship. In organizations, mentorship can apply to all leaders and
supervisors who are responsible for getting their work done through other
people. The assisted individual is usually referred to as the prot g : a
student or pupil who learns from the mentor. Understanding mentoring principles
is essential to practical implementation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.39. The Mentoring Process.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
mnemonic at Figure 10.5 demonstrates the concepts of effective mentoring.
(Mnemonics are memory aids that help us remember the various aspects of a
concept. The elements of effective mentoring, expressed as verbs, correspond to
the letters in the word itself.) The following paragraphs describe each element
and clarifies the meaning of a mentor.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 10.5. Mentoring Model.</span></b></p>

<p><span>An
effective mentor must first lead by example. When serving as a role model, make
no mistake that actions speak much louder than words. Mentoring requires the
mentor and prot g  to spend a significant amount of time together. Here, the
prot g  is constantly observing and learning from the mentor's words and
actions. The opportunity to see how the mentor deals with a variety of
situations is an important part of the process. Therefore, the mentor must show
the prot g  how a mature professional handles various challenges and
opportunities. In turn, prot g's must be willing to learn, seek assistance, and
apply what they have learned.</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.2.<b>&nbsp;Empathize.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Mentoring
involves much more than merely teaching. Mentors must empathize, showing
genuine compassion for their prot g s. Mentors who remember what it was like
when they were new and inexperienced are more effective in assisting others in
their professional development. Empathy cultivates strong bonds between mentors
and prot g's and fosters the mutual commitment that exemplifies mentoring.</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.3.<b>&nbsp;Nurture.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Nurturing
also emphasizes a caring attitude. Like a farmer and his or her crops, the
mentor nurtures the prot g . One cannot expect to sow a rich crop without
investing ample time, patience, and labor. Certainly these points seem rather
obvious, but are often the most neglected elements. Some mentors often find
themselves too busy to provide the time and effort to effectively mentor their
prot g s. Therefore, we must not expect an expert-level performance from
someone who has not received appropriate amounts of attention, training, and
time from a mentor. Remember, for people to apply, internalize, and value what
they have learned takes time.</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.4.<b>&nbsp;Teach.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Many
people, regardless of their knowledge and experience level, find teaching
uncomfortable and extremely stressful. Thankfully, some time-tested methods
provide a solid benchmark for instruction. Consider these five simple steps
when teaching and training prot g s: (1) organize the material into logical;
systematic, units of manageable size; (2) correct errors immediately; (3)
frequently review previously covered material and relate the material to the
current lesson; (4) include practical exercises to help the prot g  exercise
the newfound knowledge; and (5) evaluate the prot g s' comprehension often,
formally and informally, and provide detailed feedback on their progress.</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.5.<b>&nbsp;Organize.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Mentors
must first be organized before helping others become organized. Hence, a
systematic, methodical approach is essential. An organized mentor knows from
the very beginning what he or she wants to achieve, focusing every aspect of
the process on this goal. The time and effort spent organizing thoughts and
materials into a logical, building-block sequential plan of lessons aimed at a
precisely defined target pays big dividends in the form of improved learning
and developmental experiences for the prot g .</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.6.<b>&nbsp;Respond.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Mentoring
is a two-way communication process that requires mentors to actively listen to the
prot g s' questions and provide useful and timely responses. There may be times
when the prot g  is reluctant to ask a particular question. Therefore,
effective mentors must remain alert to recognize nonverbal behaviors and subtle
communication cues. Rather than sitting back and waiting for the prot g  to ask
questions, be proactive. Anticipate the needs, problems, and concerns of
prot g's and take care of them immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.7.<b>&nbsp;Inspire.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
mentor should be more than just a good role model, teacher, or helpful
acquaintance. Genuine mentoring encompasses an element of inspiration.
Inspirational mentors have a profound impact on their prot g's that encourages
them to transform into a more improved being. Inspiration is one of the
characteristics that distinguishes leaders from managers. The best mentors most
likely become the best leaders because they are able to inspire others.</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.8.<b>&nbsp;Network.&nbsp;</b>A good mentor introduces and
 connects' a prot g  to other people who can also provide guidance, support, resources,
and opportunities. Networking is a vital function that provides prot g's a head
start on establishing themselves in their professional community. Building a
solid network of friends, acquaintances, and associates takes time; the earlier
a prot g  can cultivate this, the better.</span></p>

<p><span>10.39.9.<b>&nbsp;Goal-Set.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Many
young, inexperienced people do not understand the importance of setting goals.
Oftentimes, they lack the expertise to establish specific, achievable, and
realistic goals. Therefore, mentors must help their prot g's understand why
goals are important; establish short- and long-term goals that are specific,
achievable, and realistic; and be available to assist them in achieving their
goals.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 10G Strategic
Leadership</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.40. Definition of Strategic Leadership.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Strategic
leadership plays a critical role in propelling today's Air Force through and
beyond the 21st century. Strategic leadership is such a broad concept, that we
may not be able to define, but we can certainly recognize strategic leadership
in action. Noel Tichy, Director of the Global Leadership Program at the Ross
School of Business, offers a comprehensible depiction as to what a strategic
leader is:</span></p>

<p><i><span> Strategic leaders guide the achievement of their organizational
vision within a larger enterprise by directing policy and strategy, building
consensus, acquiring and allocating resources, influencing organizational
culture, and shaping complex and ambiguous external environments. They lead by
example to build effective organizations, grow the next generation of leaders,
energize subordinates, seek opportunities to advance organizational goals, and
balance personal and professional demands. </span></i></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>10.41. Components of Strategic Leadership:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.41.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Enlisted
leaders apply the strategic leadership components of core values, competencies,
and actions at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels every day.
Leadership at the tactical level is predominantly direct and face-to-face. As
leaders ascend the organizational ladder to the operational level, leadership
responsibilities become more complex and sophisticated. Strategic leaders have
a responsibility to large organizations and systems and are expected to
conceptualize and integrate a variety of issues to accomplish the mission.</span></p>

<p><span>10.41.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Core
values form the foundation of leadership (paragraph 10.12), coupled with
competencies (personal, people/team, and institutional leadership) and actions.
Personal leadership focuses on interpersonal relations that directly influence
human behavior and values. People/team leadership involves more interpersonal
relations and team relationships. Leaders using this competency tailor
resources to organizations and programs. Institutional leadership is about
establishing structure, allocating resources appropriately, and articulating
the organizational vision.</span></p>

<p><span>10.41.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Actions
include training and educational activities designed to develop strategic
leadership abilities. Early career development focuses on personal competencies
at the tactical level. At the operational stage, personal leadership continues,
but the Air Force begins to emphasize people/team leadership development and
introduces institutional leadership competencies. At the strategic level, the
greatest emphasis is on developing institutional leadership competencies,
primarily through education designed to help leaders form accurate frames of
reference, make sound decisions, uncover underlying connections between general
issues, and think creatively, innovatively, and critically about new solutions
and options.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.42. Strategic Leadership:</span></b></p>

<p><span>10.42.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>At
the strategic level, Airmen must combine highly developed occupational
capabilities with competencies gained earlier in their careers to lead and
direct exceptionally complex and multi-tiered organizations. Strategic leaders
must understand Air Force missions and how operational capabilities and Airmen
are integrated to achieve synergistic results and desired effects. Strategic
leaders are also expected to demonstrate a highly developed and insightful
understanding of personal and team leadership.</span></p>

<p><span>10.42.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
successful strategic leader is the quintessential communicator, using all means
of communication. Whereas leaders at lower levels of the organization remain
focused on the short term, strategic leaders must have a future focus, spending
much of their time looking forward, positioning the organization for long-term
success.</span></p>

<p><span>10.42.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Strategic
leaders seek education and other opportunities to enhance their understanding
and appreciation of strategic leadership, its responsibilities, functions, and
impact on the organization. They fully understand their role in shaping climate
and culture through vision, policy, communication, education, coaching,
mentoring, and personal example.</span></p>

<p><b><span>10.43. Conclusion.&nbsp;</span></b><span>To&nbsp;<i>lead</i>&nbsp;means&nbsp;<i>to act as a guide</i>&nbsp;or
to guide; a&nbsp;<i>leader</i>&nbsp;is defined as  a person who leads, directs,
commands, or guides a group or activity.  These are simple definitions, but the
implications of poor or ineffective leadership are devastating to mission
success. Given the authority, anyone can command. Leading, however, is a
delicate art calling for people-oriented attributes that many find difficult to
develop and impossible to acquire. With determination and practical experience,
you can develop your leadership skill sets. Commanders depend on
noncommissioned officers to lead Airmen and accomplish the mission. This
chapter discussed the art of leadership, effective leadership,
interrelationship of leadership and management, leadership qualities, and the
concept of vision, and provided an overview on empowerment and learning. Also
provided was information on leadership flexibility and followership, dealing
effectively with change, the critical relationship between leadership and core
values, mentoring, and counseling. These concepts are fundamental to the
mission of the Air Force, as well as the careers and futures of the enlisted
force.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span>&nbsp;<b>Chapter 11</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>OFFICER AND ENLISTED
EVALUATION SYSTEMS AND CIVILIAN PERFORMANCE PROGRAM</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 11A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>11.1. Introduction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>11.1.1.
The officer and enlisted evaluations, and civilian appraisals deal directly
with the Air Force's most precious resource people. Supervisors must help their
subordinates understand their strengths and weaknesses and how their efforts
contribute to the mission. Supervisors must employ the officer and enlisted
evaluation systems, and civilian performance program in everyday situations to
help develop their subordinates. This chapter addresses the importance of
correctly using the officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and civilian
performance program, by identifying responsibilities, outlining the performance
feedback process, and provides additional information as outlined in governing
AFIs 36-2406,&nbsp;<i>Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems</i>&nbsp;and
36-1001,&nbsp;<i>Managing the Civilian Performance Program</i>&nbsp;respectively.</span></p>

<p><span>11.1.2. The officer and
enlisted evaluation systems, and civilian performance program provides:</span></p>

<p><span>11.1.2.1. Meaningful
feedback to individuals pertaining to what is expected of them, advice on how
well they are meeting expectations, and advice on how to better meet these
expectations.</span></p>

<p><span>11.1.2.2. A reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance
and potential based on performance.&nbsp;<b><i>Section 11B General
Considerations (Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems)</i></b></span></p>

<p><b><span>11.2. Purpose.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems have varied purposes. The first is to
establish performance standards and expectations for ratees, meaningful
feedback on how well the ratee is meeting those expectations, and direction on
how to better meet those established standards and expectations. The second is
to provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and
promotion potential based on that performance. The third is to provide officer
Central Selection Boards, senior NCO evaluation boards, the Weighted Airman
Promotion System, and other personnel managers' with sound information to
assist in identifying the best qualified officers and enlisted personnel for
promotion, as well as other personnel management decisions. The fourth is to
document in the permanent record any substantiated allegation of a sex-related
offense against an Airman, regardless of grade, that results in conviction by
courts-martial, non-judicial punishment, or other punitive administrative
action.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.2.1.
To accomplish these purposes, the evaluation system focuses on performance. How
well the individual does his or her job, and the qualities the individual
brings to the job, are of paramount importance to the Air Force. Performance is
most important for successful mission accomplishment and important for
development of skills and leadership abilities and in determining who will be
selected for advancement through assignments, promotions, and other personnel
actions. The evaluation system emphasizes the importance of performance in
several ways--using periodic performance feedback, as the basis for formal
evaluations, and, for officers, through performance-based promotion
recommendations.</span></p>

<p><span>11.2.2.
Effective evaluators must have an adequate understanding of Officer Evaluation
System (OES), Enlisted Evaluation System (EES), or both, depending on who they
supervise. OES/EES training was implemented in May 96 to help supervisors
fulfill their evaluation responsibilities. Unit commanders are responsible for
ensuring all firsttime supervisors receive mandatory OES/EES training (as
appropriate for their position) within 60 days of being appointed as a rater.
Additionally, Air Force members should receive annual recurring OES/EES
training. How and when this training is conducted is at the discretion of the
unit commander. To assist commanders, OES/EES Training Guides are located on
the myPers Website.</span></p>

Information and Security Classification.</b>&nbsp;Do not enter classified
information in any section of the evaluation; this includes any type of
evaluation forms, attachments to evaluations, referral documents, or
endorsements to referral documents. If an entry would result in the release of
classified information, use the word "Data Masked" in place of that
entry. The Personnel Accounting Symbol code alone is unclassified, however this
code will only be entered on the ratee. In the Senior Rater Identification
block enter five asterisks, (*****). In those cases where the evaluator is with
a classified organization or location, enter "Data Masked" for
organization nomenclature and nothing more.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Bullet
Format.</b>&nbsp;Bullet format is mandatory. Use bullet format as specified in
the appropriate table for the evaluation being accomplished. Bullets are

grade, assigned to and/or transferred into his or her command to ensure
knowledge of and familiarization with the Airman's history of sexrelated
offenses resulting in conviction by courts-martial, non-judicial punishment, or
other punitive administrative action in order to reduce the likelihood of
repeat offenses will escape the notice of current, subsequent, or higher level

ratee is aware of who is in his or her rating chain.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.6.3.3.
Must provide an ACA IAW AFI 36-2406. Official documented ACA does not preclude
a rater from performing day-to-day verbal assessments. Additionally, raters are
required to perform an assessment at the time the evaluation is presented to
the ratee. This assessment at the time the evaluation is presented, may be, but
is not required to be officially documented on the ACA worksheet. If
geographically separated, assessments can be performed electronically or telephonically.&nbsp;</span></p>

Form 911 and Section IV of the AF Form 912 by concurring or non-concurring with
the rater and making comments.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.6.4.4. Assumes the
responsibilities of the rater when applicable IAW AFI 36-2406. Note: This does
not include Permanent Change of Station, Permanent Change of Assignment,
Separation or Retirement of the rater.&nbsp;</span></p>

no one else available.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.6.6.2.
Will be aware of the contents of the Unfavorable Information File and/or
Personal Information File if applicable, on all enlisted evaluations and
returns the evaluation to the rater for reconsideration, if appropriate, to
ensure an accurate, unbiased, and an uninflated evaluation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.6.6.3. Will review
all enlisted evaluations before the commander's review and advise the commander
of any quality force indicators.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.6.6.4.
Senior NCOs may&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>be designated for organizations for which
no 8F000/First Sergeant authorization exists. Additional duty first sergeants
will not complete evaluation reviews in-lieu of an organization's 8F000/First
Sergeant. Exception: Interim first sergeants, additional duty first sergeants,
or designated Senior NCOs may complete evaluation reviews when the
organization's 8F000/First Sergeant is unavailable due to extended absence
(e.g. deployment, lengthy training, or lengthy convalescent leave).</span></p>

<p><span>11.6.7.&nbsp;<b>Ratee:</b></span></p>

<p><span>11.6.7.1. The ratee is
equally responsible for ensuring they know their rating chain and that they
received a timely ACA.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.6.7.2.
Ratee Review. Evaluations must be reviewed by the Ratee prior to becoming a
matter of record. This is the time to review for typos, spelling, and
inaccurate data and bring it to the attention of the Rater. If the data is
administratively accurate and it is just a matter of the Ratee disagreeing with
the content, the Rater is not required to change their assessment. When the Ratee
signs the evaluation, he or she is not concurring with the content, but rather
acknowledging receipt of the completed evaluation and is certifying that the
Ratee has reviewed the evaluation for administrative errors. If the Ratee
disagrees with the content, (comments and/or ratings) the Ratee may file an
appeal IAW AFI 36-2406, after the evaluation becomes a matter of record. NOTE:
An ACA form is not required upon completion of the OPR/EPR. The OPR/EPR serves
as official documentation of the feedback provided to the Ratee.</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.7. Rater/Ratee Accountability.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Raters
ensure Airmen they supervise receive an ACA to improve performance and
contributions to mission accomplishment. To assist raters in preparing
evaluations, all commissioned officers and enlisted members who are on active
duty or in an active status in a Reserve Component, shall report (in writing)
to their rater within 72 hours, any conviction for a violation of a criminal
law of the United States or violations of a criminal law of any other country 
whether or not the member is on active duty or in an active status at the time
of the conduct that provides the basis for the conviction to the member's rater
(first-line military supervisor) or summary courts-martial convening authority.
In the case of a member of the individual ready reserve, standby reserve, or
ANG, all commissioned officers and enlisted members shall report (in writing)
to their wing commanders (or equivalent), in accordance with the requirements
below within 30 days. (Note: While the National Defense Authorization Act
provision only extended the mandatory reporting to E-7s and above, the
Secretary of the Air Force has determined that any member within the United
States Air Force must report covered convictions, therefore, extends the
mandate to all grades).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.&nbsp;<b>When
to Document.</b>&nbsp;In deciding whether to document adverse information on
the performance evaluation, evaluators must consider the vast majority of
Airmen serve their entire career with honor and distinction; therefore, failure
to document misconduct which reflects departure from the core values of the Air
Force is a disservice to all Airmen competing for promotion. Additionally,
evaluators must consider items listed below when assessing performance and
potential, and specifically mention them in evaluations when appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.1. Impact of the
misconduct on the Air Force mission (Did the mission suffer in any way? Was
unit morale affected?).</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.1.1.
All commissioned officers, and enlisted members above the pay grade of E-6 (E-7
and above), who are on active duty or in an active status in a Reserve
Component, shall report in writing any conviction of such member for a
violation of a criminal law of the United States whether or not the member is
on active duty or in an active status at the time of the conduct that provides
the basis for the conviction to the member's first-line military supervisor or
summary court-martial convening authority, or in the case of a member of the
individual ready reserve, standby reserve, or ANG to the Air Reserve Personnel
Center or Air National Guard Bureau, whichever is applicable, in accordance
with the requirements below.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.1.2.
For purposes of this policy, the term  conviction  includes a plea or finding
of guilty, a plea of&nbsp;<i>nolo contendere (no contest),&nbsp;</i>and all
other actions tantamount to a finding of guilty, including adjudication
withheld, deferred prosecution, entry into adult or juvenile pretrial
intervention programs, and any similar disposition of charges.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.1.3.
For purposes of this policy, a criminal law of the United States includes any
military or other Federal criminal law; any State, district, commonwealth, or
territorial or equivalent criminal law or ordinance; and any criminal law or
ordinance of any county, parish, municipality, or local subdivision of any such
authority, other than motor vehicle violations that do not involve a court
appearance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.1.4.
Regular Air Force members shall submit reports within 15 days of the date the
conviction is announced, even if sentence has not been imposed or the member
intends to appeal the conviction. Air Reserve Component members not on active
duty but in an active status shall submit reports at the first drill period
after the date the conviction is announced, or within 30 days of the date the
conviction is announced, whichever is earlier, even if sentence has not been
imposed or the member intends to appeal the conviction. All members who must
submit evidence of their conviction, must maintain evidence of compliance with
this requirement.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.1.5.
In the event a commander or military law-enforcement official receives
information that a covered member of the Armed Forces under the jurisdiction of
another military department has become subject to a conviction for which a
report is required by this section, the commander or military law-enforcement
official receiving such information shall forward it to the member's immediate
commander. If the member's immediate commander cannot be readily identified,
the commander or military law-enforcement official receiving the information
shall forward it to the office designated by the member's military department
identified as required below.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.1.6.
Each Service shall institute procedures to ensure that the members covered by
the law comply with its requirements and the policy set forth in this
instruction. These procedures shall include points of contact for other
military departments to comply with the notification requirements above. Each
Service shall also establish points of contact to which Reserve Component
members in the individual ready reserve or standby reserve who may not know the
identity or address of their first line military supervisor or summary
court-martial convening authority may provide information of a conviction
covered under this policy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.2. Impact of the
misconduct on the Air Force as an institution (Did it bring discredit on the
Air Force?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3. Impact of the
misconduct on, and its relationship to the ratee's duties (Did it affect the
ratee's ability to fulfill his or her duties?).&nbsp;</span></p>

the misconduct on the Air Force mission (Did the mission suffer in any way? Was
unit morale affected?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3.2. Impact of
the misconduct on the Air Force as an institution (Did it bring discredit on
the Air Force?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3.3. Impact of
the misconduct on, and its relationship to the ratee's duties (Did it affect
the member's ability to fulfill his or her duties?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3.4. Grade,
assignment and experience of the ratee (Is the ratee in a  sensitive  job? Did
the ratee  know better ?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3.5. Number of
separate violations and frequency of the misconduct (Is this an isolated or
repeated incident?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3.6. Consequences
of the misconduct (Did it result in death, injury, or loss of/damage to
military or civilian property?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3.7. Other
dissimilar acts of misconduct during the reporting period (Is the ratee
establishing a pattern of misconduct?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.3.8. Existence of
unique, unusual or extenuating circumstances (Was the misconduct willful and
unprovoked, or were there aggravating factors or events?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.4. Grade,
assignment, and experience of the ratee (Is the ratee in a  sensitive  job? Did
the ratee  know better ?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.5. Number of
separate violations and frequency of the misconduct (Is this an isolated or
repeated incident?).&nbsp;</span></p>

of the misconduct (Did it result in death, injury, or loss of/damage to
military or civilian property?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.7. Other
dissimilar acts of misconduct during the reporting period (Is the ratee
establishing a pattern of misconduct?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.1.8. Existence of
unique, unusual, or extenuating circumstances (Was the misconduct willful and
unprovoked, or were there aggravating factors or events?).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.&nbsp;<b>What to
Report.</b>&nbsp;Adverse Actions: For the purpose of this policy,  adverse
action  includes:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.1.
Reportable Civilian Offenses. A conviction of a Federal criminal law; any
State, district, commonwealth, or territorial or equivalent criminal law or
ordinance; or any criminal law or ordinance of any county, parish,
municipality, city, township, or local subdivision of any such authority, and
convictions of any foreign criminal law; other than convictions for motor
vehicle violations that do not require a court appearance. Specifically,
convictions required to be reported include the following: 1) any finding of
guilt; 2) any plea of guilty; 3) any plea of no contest or&nbsp;<i>nolo
contendere</i>; 4) any plea of guilty in exchange for a deferred prosecution or
diversion program, and/or; 5) any other similar disposition of civilian
criminal charges.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.1.1.
Any citation or violation of a motor vehicle offense which ultimately results
in a conviction of a lesser included offense (resulting from the original
citation) is not reportable if the lesser included offense would not have
required a court appearance. For example, a member who is charged with reckless
driving (an offense requiring a court appearance), but is found guilty of
speeding (an offense not requiring a court appearance) has not been convicted
of an offense requiring reporting. Commanders and/or supervisors who have
questions regarding whether a particular conviction triggers the mandated
comment should consult with their staff judge advocate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.1.2.
In the event a commander or military law-enforcement official receives
information that a member of the Air Force, under the jurisdiction of another
military department, has become subject to a conviction for which a report is
required by this section, the commander or military law-enforcement official
receiving such information shall forward it to the member's immediate
commander. If the member's immediate commander cannot be readily identified,
the commander or military law-enforcement official receiving the information
shall forward it to the office designated by the member's military department
identified as required below.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.1.3.
Procedures shall be instituted to ensure members covered by the law comply with
its requirements and the policy as stated in this instruction. These procedures
shall include points of contact for other military departments to comply with
the notification requirements above. Points of contact shall also be
established with the Reserve Component members in the individual ready reserve
or standby reserve who may not know the identity or address of their first line
military supervisor or summary court-martial convening authority may provide
information of a conviction covered under this policy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.2.
Complaints of sex-related offenses against a member, regardless of grade,
resulting in conviction by courtmartial, non-judicial punishment, or punitive
administrative action require a mandatory notation on the member's next EPR,
OPR, or Training Report, and Promotion Recommendation Form (if not already
documented on an evaluation or court-martial in the officer's selection
record). Sex-related offenses include violations of Article 120 of the Uniform
Code of Military Justice (rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual contact and
abusive sexual contact), Article 125 (forcible sodomy, which is forced oral or
anal sex, and bestiality), Article 120a (stalking), Article 120b (rape and
sexual assault of a child), Article 120c (other sexual misconduct, which
includes indecent viewing/recording/ broadcasting, forcible pandering, and
indecent exposure) or attempts to commit any of those offenses. The effective
date of the requirement for notation is 26 Dec 13.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.3.
If a member has been convicted by a court-martial or if the Senior Rater
decides to file any adverse information in an Airman's Officer Selection Record
or Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Selection Record, comments relating to the
ratee's behavior are mandatory on the ratee's next OPR, EPR or Training Report,
and Promotion Recommendation Form (if not already documented on an evaluation
or court-martial in the Officer Selection Record or Senior Non-Commissioned
Officer Selection Record). The evaluation becomes a referral for the OPR, EPR,
and Training Report. Comments are also required on Airmen who have been
convicted of a  reportable civilian offense  that: 1) is a sexual offense that
is the same as, or closely related to, Uniform Code of Military Justice,
Articles 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, 125, or attempts to commit any of those
offenses; 2) carries a possible sentence of confinement for more than one year,
or death; or 3) resulted in a sentence that included unsuspended confinement.
For guidance on interpreting this paragraph and sub-paragraphs, supervisors and
commanders should consult the servicing staff judge advocate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.2.3.1.
A rater is not required to comment on the conviction in a current report if,
during a previous rating period, the rater already commented on the underlying
misconduct that ultimately resulted in the conviction. For example: In a case
where a member is arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence by
off-base officials who decline to waive jurisdiction, the member's commander
issues the member an Letter of Reprimand based on the evidence, and then
comments on the Driving Under the Influence Letter of Reprimand in the ratee s
next evaluation. Then, the downtown prosecution results in a conviction during
a future reporting period. In such a case, the rater is not required to comment
on the Driving Under the Influence conviction because the underlying misconduct
that led to the conviction was already addressed in a previous
evaluation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.3.&nbsp;<b>Extraordinary Cases</b>. Raters may request a
waiver of the mandatory requirement to document civilian convictions for good
cause. The waiver request will route from the rater, through any required
additional rater and the ratee's commander, to the ratee's Senior Rater. The
Senior Rater may either deny the waiver request or endorse the request and forward
to the Major Command Commander (or in the case of reports within Air Force
District of Washington, United States Air Force Academy, or any Direct
Reporting Unit or Field Operating Agency reporting to an activity on the Air</span></p>

<p><span>Staff, to the Vice Chief
of Staff of the Air Force, or in the case of the ANG, to the Director, Air
National Guard). The Director, Air National Guard may delegate this authority
to the respective state's Adjutant General, or equivalent for</span></p>

<p><span>Territories
and the District of Columbia, who will make determinations after consultation
with the Director, Air National Guard, or the Deputy Director, Air National
Guard. Both the nature and the outcome of the offense for each approved waiver
will remain on file with the Director, Air National Guard. No further
delegation is authorized.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.3.1.
If the Senior Rater denies the waiver request, the decision regarding the
waiver request is final and may not be appealed or considered further. This
does not prevent an individual from challenging any completed report in any
other appropriate forums, e.g., Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, Air Force
Board for Correction of Military Records.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.3.1.1.
When the Senior Rater endorses the waiver request and forwards it to the final
approval authority (Major Command Commander, Vice Chief of Staff, or Director,
Air National Guard), the final approval authority can either approve the
exception, allowing the exclusion of any comments in the EPR, OPR, Training
Report, and Promotion Recommendation Form, or deny the request, resulting in
the mandatory inclusion of comments regarding the ratee's criminal
behavior.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.3.1.2.
The final approval authority is delegable to the Major Command/CV or, in the
case of the Air Force/CV, to the Air Force/CVA; no further delegation beyond a
The Adjutant General, or equivalent, is authorized for the ANG. The decision of
the approval authority is the final decision for such waiver requests and may
not be appealed or considered further. This does not prevent an individual from
challenging any completed report in any other appropriate forums, e.g.,
Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;11.7.3.1.3.
In order to approve any waiver requests, the approval authority must issue a
written finding that the mandatory comments for the specific criminal
conviction are not in the best interests of the Air Force and that the
inclusion of any such comments would unduly harm the ratee. Upon final
decision, the final approval authority will forward the waiver documentation to
Air Force Personnel Center/DP3SP via email and Air Force Personnel
Center/DP2SSM via email. Written waiver approvals will be filed in the member s
Master Personnel Records Group for the sole purpose of documenting the final
approval.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.4.&nbsp;<b>Comments.</b>&nbsp;In
all cases, when comments are included in performance evaluations, they must be
specific, outlining the event and any corrective action taken. Comments such as
 conduct unbecoming   or  an error in judgment led to an off-duty incident  
are too vague. Examples of valid comments are  Master Sergeant Smith drove
while intoxicated, for which he received an Article 15  and  Capt Jones made
improper sexually suggestive and harassing comments to a squadron member, for
which he received a letter of reprimand. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.5.&nbsp;<b>Organizational
Climate.</b>&nbsp;Organizational climate is defined as the way in which members
in a unit perceive and characterize their unit environment. All Airmen are
responsible for creating an organizational climate in which every member is
treated with dignity and respect, and one that does not tolerate unlawful
discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual assault in any form. NCOs and
officers are not only responsible for creating this environment but are also
accountable for it. NCOs and officers can build a healthy organizational
climate by: communicating clear direction at all levels of supervision;
adhering to and enforcing standards; not tolerating and, when necessary,
appropriately responding to any form of sexual harassment, sexual assault,
hazing, unlawful discrimination, or any other conduct harmful to the good order
and discipline of the unit; being accountable for their actions; and
cultivating an environment where teamwork, unity and cohesiveness are the
standard practice.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.5.1. All NCO and
officer evaluators will assess their ratee(s) on what the member did to ensure
a healthy organizational climate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.5.2.
Commanders at every level have an even greater responsibility to create a
healthy climate in their command. Additionally, they are responsible for
ensuring adherence to Sexual Assault Prevention Program directives. Command
climate, just like organizational climate, is the perception of a unit s
environment by its members. Commanders are ultimately responsible for the good
order and discipline in their unit and have unique responsibility and authority
to ensure good order and discipline. Therefore, evaluators must take this
special responsibility and authority into consideration when evaluating a
commander's effectiveness in ensuring a healthy command climate. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.7.6.&nbsp;<b>Equal
Opportunity and Treatment.</b>&nbsp;The expectation is fair and equal treatment
of all and enforcement of the same behavior in subordinates. Evaluators must
consider a member's commitment to Equal Opportunity and Treatment when
evaluating performance and making a promotion recommendation. The goal is to
ensure fair, accurate, and unbiased evaluations to help ensure the best
qualified members are identified for positions of higher responsibility. Evaluations
must reflect serious or repeated occurrences of discrimination, to include
sexual harassment, as prescribed in AFI 36-2706,&nbsp;<i>Military Equal
Opportunity Program</i>.&nbsp;<b><i>Section 11C Performance Feedback</i></b></span></p>

<p><b><span>11.8. Purpose.</span></b></p>

<p><span>ACA
is formal communication between a rater and ratee to communicate
responsibility, accountability, Air Force culture, an Airman's critical role in
support of the mission, individual readiness, and performance feedback on
expectations regarding duty performance and how well the ratee is meeting those
expectations to include information to assist the ratee in achieving success.
It is intended to increase Airmen interaction and support at all levels. If
done correctly, mentorship will create and sustain a culture of belonging. The
ACA is also intended to provide Airmen an opportunity to discuss their personal
and professional goals. Raters document the session on the ACA worksheet and
use the Performance Feedback in Section VI to assess or discuss the objectives,
standards, behavior, and performance with the ratee. Providing this information
helps an individual contribute to positive communication, improve performance,
and grow professionally. The following information applies to all military
personnel.</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.9. Responsibilities:</span></b></p>

<p><span>11.9.1. The ratee
will:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.1.1. Know when ACA
sessions are due.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.1.2. If a ratee
requests a feedback session, the rater will provide one within 30 days of
receipt of the request, provided 60 days have passed, since the last feedback
session (i.e., Ratee Requested).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.1.3. Notify the
rater and, if necessary, the rater's rater, when required or requested ACA did
not take place.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.1.4.
Complete Section III on their own and review Section IX (<i>AB thru Technical
Sergeant</i>) or VIII (<i>Master Sergeant thru Chief Master Sergeant</i>) for
joint communication. Sign the ACA and rater's copy of the ACA notice indicating
the date the supervisor conducted the ACA session.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2. The rater
will:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.1.
Conduct ACA sessions as required by this instruction. In addition, ACA sessions
will be conducted at the ratee's request or when deemed necessary (provided 60
days have passed since the last ACA session [i.e., Rater Directed]).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.2. Prepare for,
schedule, and conduct ACA sessions (avoid conflicts with TDY, leave, etc., when
possible), regardless of whether the rater received an ACA notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.3. Understand Air
Force standards and expectations and consider them when providing ACA to
personnel.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.4.
Provide realistic assessments to help the ratee improve performance and grow
professionally and personally. Realistic assessments include in-depth
discussions with the ratee and written comments on the ACA worksheet, not just
marks on the form.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.5. Provide the
original completed and signed ACA worksheet to the ratee.</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.6.
Retain a copy of the signed and dated ACA notice and worksheet. The Midterm ACA
is a required, mandatory supporting document to be routed with the Performance
Evaluation (EPR/OPR), however, will not be made a matter of the official
record. In addition, the Rater will retain a copy of the initial and midterm
ACA as this may be needed for any future appeals.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.7.
The ACA is a communication tool and is not to be used to discover or document
behavior which may result in administrative or judicial action. NOTE: It is
important that behavior representing a significant deviation from expected
standards is recorded in other administrative forms (i.e. Letter of Reprimand,
Letter of Counseling, Letter of Admonishment, Memorandum for Record,
etc.).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.2.8. Provide the
ratee with the most current Air Force Benefits Fact Sheet.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.3. The rater s
rater will:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.3.1. Monitor
personnel to ensure raters properly conduct ACA sessions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.3.2. Conduct ACA sessions
when:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.3.2.1. A
lower-level rater is not available due to unusual circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.3.2.2. Officially
assuming the subordinate rater's responsibilities.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.4. The unit
commander will:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.4.1. Administer the
ACA program.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.4.2. Monitor raters
and ratees to ensure ACA sessions are conducted properly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.4.3. Consider
disciplining and removing from supervisory positions those raters who fail to
conduct documented ACA sessions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.5. The Military
Personnel Section will:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.5.1.
Provide ACA notices to raters and ratees. ANG does not currently have
standardized automated process to create ACA notices for raters and ratees. ANG
Military Personnel Sections may utilize an alternate form of communication to
notify all raters and ratees of ACA schedules.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.5.2. Not be
required to maintain repository for ACAs for personnel assigned to wing.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.9.6. Unit will:&nbsp; 11.9.6.1. At the unit commander s
request, develop a tracking mechanism to ensure ACAs are conducted. It is the
responsibility of individual raters to maintain copies of all completed ACAs
and all signed ACA notices (or appropriate statements) on their assigned ratees
(Regular Air Force only).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.10. Who Requires an ACA.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>ACAs
are mandatory for officers, second lieutenant through colonel, and all Regular
Air Force and Air Reserve Component personnel. If an individual requests an ACA
session, the rater will provide one within 30 days of receipt of the request,
provided 60 days have passed since the last ACA session. Do not prepare an ACA
when a ratee is a captive, patient, prisoner, absent without leave, etc. For
student officers receiving AF Forms 475, ACA is not required, but may be given
at the discretion of the commander of the school. For student enlisted
personnel, in approved initial skills training or advanced skills training
courses an ACA is not required, but may be given at the discretion of the
commander of the school. For those performance evaluations completed on
non-rated initial skills training or advanced skills training course students,
academic progress reports, such as the AETC Form 156 Student Training Report,
captured in the Technical Training Management System or an equivalent document
utilized by non-AETC institutions of instruction, will serve in-lieu of the
mandatory mid-term ACA. ACAs are&nbsp;<b><i>not&nbsp;</i></b>required for
Airmen who have Permanent Change of Station to prisoner status in a long term
military confinement facility owned by the Air Force Security Forces
Center.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.11. Guidance for Conducting ACA Sessions.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>ACA
sessions will be conducted face-to-face. EXCEPTION: Raters may conduct sessions
by telephone only in unusual circumstances where face-to-face sessions are
impractical, such as when the rater and ratee are geographically separated or
the rater and/or ratee is on extended TDY. When a telephonic session is
conducted, the rater forwards the ACA worksheet to the ratee to complete
Section III and review for discussion Section VII. The finalized form is
forwarded to the ratee within 10 calendar days after the session.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.12. When to Hold Documented ACA
Sessions.&nbsp;</span></b><span>See Table 11.1.</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.13. The ACA Notice:</span></b></p>

<p><span>11.13.1.
The rater should receive a computer-generated ACA notice 30 days after
supervision begins (identifying initial or follow-up ACA sessions as required)
and again halfway between the time supervision began and the projected
performance report close-out date (identifying mid-term ACA session
requirement). This notice serves to remind raters that an ACA session is due;
however, failure to receive an ACA notice does not justify failing to hold a
required session.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.13.2.
Since the ratee shares the responsibility to ensure ACA sessions are conducted,
an ACA notice is also sent to the ratee, through his or her unit, 30 days after
sending the notice to the rater (for officers) or concurrently with the notice
sent to the rater (for enlisted).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.14. Which ACA Form to Use:</span></b></p>

<p><span>11.14.1. For Lieutenant
through Colonel, use AF Form 724.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p align="right"><span>11.14.2. For a Master
Sergeant thru Chief Master Sergeant, use AF Form 932.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.14.3. For Technical
Sergeant and below, use AF Form 931.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>11.15. Preparing the ACA Worksheet.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The ACA worksheet should, as thoroughly as
possible, outline the issues discussed during the ACA session; however, it is
primarily a guide for conducting the assessment session, not a transcript.
Therefore, omission of an issue from the form does not, by itself, constitute
proof that the issue was not discussed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.1. The ACA
worksheet may be handwritten or typed by the rater providing the assessment<i>.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.2. Section I,
Personal Information, is self-explanatory. Fill in all required data.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.3. Section II,
Types of Assessment. In the appropriate box, indicate whether the assessment is
initial, mid-term, follow-up, ratee requested, or rater directed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.4. Section III,
Self-Assessment is completed by the ratee. This area provides information to
the rater on where the ratee assesses themselves, and assists the rater with
information when accomplishing the overall assessment.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.5. Section IV,
Airman's Critical Role in Support of the Mission. This section is used to
convey to the ratee their critical role in achieving mission success.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.5.1.
Organizational Climate Assessment. It is mandatory for raters to include expectations
for contributing to a healthy organizational climate for Airmen up to the grade
of Senior Airman. Raters must also ensure that NCOs and Officers are
accountable for creating a healthy organizational climate. Raters must ensure
that every commander knows he/she is responsible for, and will be held
accountable for, ensuring their unit has a healthy command climate. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.6.
Section V, Individual Readiness Index. Documents the Airmen's readiness status
and Air and Space Expeditionary Force Indicator. Place an  E  in this block if
member is an Enabler. Discuss importance of meeting deployment
requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.7.
Section VI, Performance: Leadership/Primary Duties/Followership/Training,
covers those qualities and skills required of all personnel. The Performance:
Leadership/Primary Duties/Followership/Training has five sub-sections for
Technical Sergeant and below, and eight sub-sections for Master Sergeant thru
Chief Master Sergeant, to select from each performance factor. The rater places
a mark in the appropriate block which indicates the ratee's level of
performance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.7.1.
Since the primary purpose of the initial ACA session is to establish
expectations for the upcoming rating period, a rater is not expected to have
already developed a clear-cut opinion of an individual's performance by the
time the session is conducted. Therefore, raters will mark the  Initial  block
in Section II, Type of Assessment, and will leave blocks in Section VI,
Performance: Leadership/Primary Duties/Followership/Training blank, while
discussing each area, and the performance expectations for the rate in each
area during the feedback session.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.7.2.
For all other ACA types, the rater will indicate how the ratee is meeting the
established expectations by marking one block under each main heading. These
markings translate to an aggregate rating on the performance evaluation, and
provide an indication of how the ratee is meeting the expectations set forth by
the rater while providing the basis for the ACA session discussion.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.8.
AF Form 931, Section VII<i>, Followership/Leadership</i>, documents an Airman s
ability to lead and develop subordinates and exercise effective followership in
mission accomplishment. The Followership/Leadership section has four sub-sections
to select from for each performance factor. The rater places a mark in the
appropriate block which indicates the ratee's level of performance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>11.15.9.
AF Form 931, Section VIII, and AF Form 932, Section VII,&nbsp;<i>Whole Airman
Concept</i>, consider the Airman's interpersonal relations that directly
influence behavior and values, level of effort to improve themselves personally
and professionally, and their devotion and enthusiasm. This section has three
sub-sections for both Airman Basic thru Technical Sergeant,<i>&nbsp;</i>and

<p align="center"><b><span>TRAINING AND EDUCATION</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 12A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>12.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A
"job" does not guarantee success, however, effective On the Job
Training; Job Knowledge, Job Proficiency and Job Experience will ultimately
lead to a successful career and with continued Education and Training, a solid
national defense. On-the-job training (OJT) has been around since the beginning
of history and has been used in the United States by both public and private
industries for many years. Today, most successful companies have effective OJT
programs because OJT works. Well-trained workers mean higher production,
positive morale, greater profits, and higher wages. Air Force training costs
millions of dollars annually, for good reason. To accomplish the mission,
whether that means satellites in orbit, planes in the air, reports to higher
headquarters, or vehicles on the road, training is a must. In addition to OJT,
training management covers upgrade training, skill levels, retraining, and
training responsibilities, forms, and documentation. Finally, each base
education office provides Service members with educational opportunities in
which they may voluntarily participate during off-duty time or other times, as
authorized by military policies. The base education office also provides
information on financial assistance and commissioning programs.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 12B Training
Management</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>12.2. Education and Training Purpose.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Skilled
and trained personnel are critical to the Air Force in providing a strong
national defense capability. The Air Force OJT program provides training for
personnel to attain knowledge and skill qualifications required to perform
duties in their specialty.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.3. Strategy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Develop,
manage, and execute realistic and flexible training programs to produce a
highly skilled, motivated force capable of carrying out all tasks and functions
in support of the Air Force mission. These programs should provide the
foundation for Air Force readiness.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.4. Training and Mission Accomplishment.</span></b><span>&nbsp; Training is an integral part of the
unit's mission. An effective training program requires commander and
supervisory involvement at all levels.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.5. Training and Airman Career Program.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Supervisors must take an
active role in the trainee's career progression and<b>&nbsp;</b>explain<b>&nbsp;</b>the
relationship between training and career progression. While the supervisor s
primary responsibility is to plan a program that outlines specific short-term,
mission-related goals for the trainee, overall success depends on the
supervisor's ability to advise and assist Airmen in reaching their long-range
career objectives.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><b><span>12.6. Training Components.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force OJT
program consists of three components:</span></p>

<p><span>12.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Job
Knowledge</b> satisfied through career development courses (CDC) designed to
provide career knowledge, general task, and deployment/unit type code task
knowledge applicable to the Air Force specialty code that is gained through a
planned program of study involving CDCs or technical references listed in the
applicable career field education and training plan (CFETP) across a wide
spectrum of subjects pertaining to a career field. When CDCs are not available,
trainees study the applicable technical references identified by the supervisor
and/or CFETP.</span></p>

<p><span>12.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Job
Proficiency</b> hands-on training provided on the job, allowing the trainee to
gain proficiency in tasks performed in the work center.</span></p>

<p><span>12.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Job
Experience</b> gained during and after upgrade training to build confidence and
competence.</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.7. Upgrade Training.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Upgrade training is the
key to the total training program. It leads to award of the higher skill level
and is designed to increase skills and abilities. Air Force specialty code
upgrade training requirements for award of 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels are
outlined in Chapter 4 of AFI 36-2201,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Training Program</i>,
AFI 36-2101,&nbsp;<i>Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and
Enlisted),&nbsp;</i>and the applicable CFETP.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.7.1.<b>&nbsp;Apprentice.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen
must<b>&nbsp;</b>complete an initial skills course for award of the 3-skill
level. Retraining into an Air Force specialty code may be accomplished via OJT
alone only when specified in the retraining instructions and as approved by the
Air Force Career Field Manager or the Air Reserve Component career field
functional manager. Personnel retraining via OJT may be awarded a 3-skill level
when they complete knowledge training on all tasks taught in the initial skills
course and other tasks and mandatory requirements identified by the Air Force Career
Field Manager.</span></p>

<p><span>12.7.2.<b>&nbsp;Journeyman.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen
must complete mandatory CDCs if available and applicable mandatory core tasks
identified in the CFETP. Award of the 5-skill level also requires completion of
a minimum of 12 months in upgrade training and mandatory requirements listed in
the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory. Additionally, the member must
be recommended by the supervisor and approved by the commander. Individuals in
retraining status, training status code (Training Status Code F), are subject
to the same training requirements.&nbsp;<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;The member must
complete a minimum of 9 months in upgrade training.</span></p>

<p><span>12.7.3.<b>&nbsp;Craftsman.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>To be a craftsman, the
member must be at least a staff sergeant; complete mandatory CDCs, if
available; and complete applicable mandatory core tasks identified in the
CFETP. Award of the 7-skill level also requires completion of: a 7-skill level
craftsman course (if Air Force specialty code requires it); mandatory
requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory; and a
minimum of 12 months in training. Additionally, the member must be recommended
by the supervisor and approved by the commander. Individuals in retraining
status (Training Status Code G) are subject to the same training requirements.&nbsp;<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;The
member must complete a minimum of 6 months in upgrade training.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.7.4.&nbsp;<b>Superintendent.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>For
award of the 9-skill level, the member must be at least a senior master
sergeant and meet mandatory requirements listed in the Air Force Enlisted
Classification Directory, be recommended by the supervisor, and be approved by
the commander.</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.8. Retraining Program.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
retraining program is designed to balance the number of personnel in specific
grades and year groups of the Air Force specialty. Once retraining is approved
and the Airman has been assigned duty in the new specialty, upgrade training
begins.</span></p>

<p><span>With minor exceptions,
training requirements are identical for retrainees and standard upgrade
trainees.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.9. Training Responsibilities:</span></b></p>

<p><span>12.9.1.<b>&nbsp;Unit Training Manager (UTM).</b>&nbsp;The
UTM is the commander's key staff member responsible for overall management of
the training program. UTMs serve as training consultants to all unit members
and determine if quality training programs are in effect within all sections.
UTMs:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.1.1.
Develop, manage, and conduct training in support of in-garrison and
expeditionary mission requirements; advise and assist commanders and unit
personnel in executing their training responsibilities; and conduct a staff assistance
visit of the unit's training program every 18 months.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.1.2. Interview
newly assigned personnel within 30 days (60 days for Air Reserve Component) to
determine training status and CDC enrollment/progression requirements. Initiate
Air Force Form 623,&nbsp;<i>Individual</i>&nbsp;<i>Training Record,</i>&nbsp;six-part
folders (when required by the Air Force Career Field Manager), or approved
electronic equivalent, for all trainees entering upgrade training for the first
time and provide to the supervisor. Conduct a comprehensive trainee orientation
according to AFI 36-2201 for trainees initially entering upgrade training
within 60 days of assignment (90 days for Air Reserve Component). UTMs must
also manage the unit CDC program and conduct a training progress review with
the supervisor and trainee at the 24th month of upgrade training to evaluate
status.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.1.3. Ensure all
work centers have a master training plan. Assist work centers in developing a
master training plan to plan, manage, and execute training activities.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Supervisor.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Supervisors
have the single greatest impact on mission accomplishment. They must share
their experiences and expertise to meet mission requirements and provide a
quality training program to the trainee. Supervisors must plan, conduct, and
evaluate training. Supervisors will:</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.2.1.
Use CFETPs (or approved electronic equivalent) to manage work center and
individual training and develop master training plans to ensure completion of
all work center duty position requirements (for example, 100 percent task
coverage). The supervisor must also integrate training with day-to-day work
center operations and consider trainer and equipment availability, training
opportunities, and schedules.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.2.2. Conduct and document work center
training orientation within 60 days of new assignment (120 days for Air Reserve
Component). Also, conduct and document an initial evaluation of newly assigned
personnel's trainee qualifications within 60 days of initial permanent change
of station or permanent change of assignment (120 days for Air Reserve
Component).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.2.3. Select
trainers (and certifiers as required by the Air Force Career Field Manager)
based on skill qualifications with the assistance of the UTM.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.2.4. Administer the
CDC program for assigned trainees.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.2.5.<b>&nbsp;</b>Maintain
Air Force Form 623, six-part folder, or other approved training record for
Airmen in the grades of airman basic through technical sergeant (or personnel
in combat ready duty positions, if required by the Air Force Career Field Manager)
and senior noncommissioned officers in retraining status, or as directed by the
Air Force Career Field Manager. Before submitting members for upgrade, ensure
the trainee, as a minimum, meets all mandatory requirements as defined in the
Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory, CFETP, and the Air Force job
qualification standard (AFJQS).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.3.<b>&nbsp;Trainer.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The trainer and
supervisor may be the same individual. If necessary, the supervisor may assign
someone else to provide the training. Trainers are selected based on their
experience and ability to provide instruction to the trainees. Additionally,
they must maintain task qualification and complete the Air Force Training
Course. Trainer responsibilities include planning, conducting, and documenting
training; preparing and using teaching outlines or task breakdowns, as
necessary; developing evaluation tools; and briefing the trainee and supervisor
on the training evaluation results.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.4.<b>&nbsp;Task Certifier.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Task
certifiers provide third-party certification and evaluation on tasks identified
by the Air Force Career Field Manager, if applicable. The certifier must
conduct additional evaluations and certify qualification on those designated
tasks. Certifiers must be at least a staff sergeant with a 5-skill level or
civilian equivalent, attend the Air Force Training Course, and be capable of
evaluating the task being certified. Certifiers will develop evaluation tools
or use established training evaluation tools and methods to determine the
trainee's ability and training program effectiveness and will brief the
trainee, supervisor, and trainer on the training evaluation results.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.5.<b>&nbsp;Trainee.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The trainee is the focal
point of the Air Force training program. Trainees must make every effort to
become qualified to perform in their Air Force specialty. The success and
quality of trainee training greatly depends on the relationship between the
supervisor, trainer, and trainee. Trainees must:</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.5.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Actively
participate in all opportunities for upgrade and qualification training.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.5.2. Comprehend the
applicable CFETP requirements and career path.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.5.3. Obtain and
maintain knowledge, qualifications, and appropriate skill level within the
assigned specialty.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.5.4. Budget on- and
off-duty time to complete assigned training tasks, particularly CDC and
self-study training requirements, within established time limits.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.5.5. Request
assistance from the supervisor, trainer, and UTM when having difficulty with
any part of training.</span></p>

<p><span>12.9.5.6. Acknowledge
and document task qualification upon completion of training.</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.10. Training Forms and Documents.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Training
documentation is important to personnel at all levels because it validates the
status of training and task qualification. Documentation also helps management
assess mission capability and readiness, and it defines requirements for
individual career progression.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.1.<b>&nbsp;Air Force Form 623.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force Form 623
(or electronic equivalent) is the standard folder used as a training record.
The form reflects past and current qualifications and is used to determine
training requirements. Supervisors maintain the Air Force Form 623 for all
assigned personnel according to AFI 36-2201.<i>&nbsp;</i>The form is available
to all personnel in the chain of command, including the UTM, upon request.
Return the form to the member upon separation, retirement, commissioning, or
promotion to master sergeant, unless otherwise directed by the Air Force Career
Field Manager.&nbsp;<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;Do not give Air Force Forms 623
containing classified information to the individual.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.2.<b>&nbsp;Career Field Education and
Training Program (CFETP).</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The CFETP is a
comprehensive core document identifying life-cycle education and training
requirements, training support resources, core and home station training, and
deployment/Unit Type Code task requirements for a specialty. Supervisors use
the CFETP to plan, prioritize, manage, and execute training within the career
field. CFETPs are used to identify and certify all past and current
qualifications. Keep at least one copy of the entire CFETP (Part I and II), in
the work center for general access and master training plan development. Unless
otherwise directed by the Air Force Career Field Manager, work center
supervisors may file only Part II of the CFETP, with cover page and
identification page, in the Air Force Form 623, or equivalent form. If the
CFETP is divided into distinct sections (by aircraft, duty position, or
mission, etc.) then file only the sections applicable to the individual, such
as current/past qualifications, and current upgrade/duty position training
requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Part
I.</b>&nbsp;Provides information necessary for overall management of the
specialty and is maintained as part of the work center master training plan.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Part
II.</b>&nbsp;Contains the specialty training standard identifying the duties,
tasks, and technical references to support training, AETC-conducted training,
core and home station training tasks, deployment/Unit Type Code tasks, and
correspondence course requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.3.&nbsp;<b>Air Force Job Qualification
Standard (AFJQS).</b></span></p>

<p><span>The AFJQS is a training
document approved by the Air Force Career Field Manager for a particular job
type or duty position within an Air Force specialty.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.4.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force IMT 623A,&nbsp;<i>On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet</i>.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Use Air Force IMT 623A,
or automated version, to document an individual's training progress. The form
reflects status, counseling, and breaks in training. The supervisor and/or
trainer and the trainee must sign and date all entries.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.5.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force IMT 797,&nbsp;<i>Job Qualification Standard Continuation/Command JQS</i>.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force IMT 797 is a
continuation of the CFETP, Part II, or AFJQS. This form defines locally
assigned duty position, home station training, and deployment/Unit Type Code
requirements not included in the CFETP, Part II.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.6.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force IMT 803,&nbsp;<i>Report of Task Evaluations</i>.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Evaluators use Air Force
IMT 803 to conduct and document completion of task evaluations during training
staff assistance visits, when directed by the commander, or when task
certification requires validation. File completed evaluations conducted on a
single trainee by the supervisor/trainer or task certifier in Air Force Form
623 until upgraded or no longer applicable to the current duty position.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.7.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force IMT 1098,&nbsp;<i>Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>Supervisors use Air
Force IMT 1098 to document selected tasks requiring recurring training or
evaluation. Air Force and major command directives may identify tasks contained
in the CFETP that require special certification, recurring training, or
evaluation.</span></p>

<p><span>12.10.8.<b>&nbsp;Master Training Plan.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The master training plan
employs a strategy for ensuring all work center job requirements are completed
by using a master task listing. The master training plan provides milestones
for tasks and CDC completion, and prioritizes deployment/Unit Type Code, home
station training, upgrade, and qualification tasks.</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.11. Career Development Course Program
Management:</span></b></p>

<p><span>12.11.1.<b>&nbsp;Purpose and Scope:</b></span></p>

<p><span>12.11.1.1.
CDCs are published to provide the information necessary to satisfy the career
knowledge component of OJT. These courses are developed from references
identified in the CFETP that correlate with mandatory knowledge items listed in
the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory. CDCs must contain information
on basic principles, techniques, and procedures common to an Air Force
specialty code. They do not contain information on specific equipment or tasks
unless the specific equipment or task best illustrates a procedure or technique
having utility to the entire Air Force specialty code.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.1.2.
Headquarters Air University/A4L electronically publishes an  Air Force
specialty code listing of CDC requirements, identifying all mandatory CDCs for
skill-level upgrade.  The list is available on the Headquarters Air
University/A4L website at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/"><span>http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/</span></a><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>under the Course and Admin Information tab.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.<b>&nbsp;CDC Administration:</b></span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.1. If available,
supervisors will use CDCs to satisfy career knowledge requirements for upgrade
training.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.2. If a CDC
becomes available after entering upgrade training, the individual does not have
to take the CDC, unless specified by the Air Force Career Field Manager.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.3. The UTM will
ensure trainees are enrolled in required CDC material within 45 days of
in-processing (within 60 days for overseas units).</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.4.
Within 10 duty days of receipt, the UTM issues CDC material to the supervisor
and trainee and briefs them on proper use of the CDC and documents the
trainee's Air Force IMT 623A or equivalent automated training record.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.5. The
supervisor determines volume sequence of study, sets the overall course
completion schedule, and develops a tracking system to monitor progress. Each
volume must be completed within 30 days. (<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;The UTM may
grant an extension due to mission requirements. Air Reserve Component and
individual mobilization augmentees have 60 days.) If necessary, the supervisor
determines the reason for slow progress, counsels the trainee, documents the
counseling on Air Force IMT 623A or automated version, and places the trainee
in supervised study.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.6. The trainee
answers the unit review exercise questions. The unit review exercise is an
 open book  teaching device. The trainee transfers answers to the field scoring
sheet. The supervisor scores the unit review exercise, conducts review training
on the areas missed, fills in the bottom of the scoring sheet, places the field
scoring sheet in the Air Force Form 623 or automated training records, counsels
the trainee, and documents Air Force IMT 623A or automated version. The
supervisor will conduct a comprehensive review of the entire CDC with the
trainee in preparation for the course examination and documents the review on
the Air Force IMT 623A or automated version.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.7. The
supervisor will notify the UTM to schedule and order the course examination.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.8.
If the trainee receives a satisfactory result, the supervisor conducts and
documents review training, then signs and places the course examination
scorecard in the Air Force Form 623 or automated training records until the
trainee completes upgrade training or qualification training.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.9. If the
trainee receives an unsatisfactory result, the unit commander, with help from
the UTM or base training manager, interviews the supervisor and trainee to
determine reason for failure and corrective action required within 30 days from
initial notification (90 days for Air Reserve Component and individual
mobilization augmentees). The supervisor documents the counseling on Air Force
IMT 623A or automated version, places the trainee in supervised review
training, and forwards a copy of the evaluation to the base training office.</span></p>

<p><span>12.11.2.10. If the
trainee receives a second unsatisfactory course examination result, the unit
commander, with assistance from the UTM or base training manager, interviews
the supervisor and trainee to determine reason for failure within 30 days from
initial notification (90 days for Air Reserve Component and individual
mobilization augmentees). After reviewing the facts, the unit commander decides
on one of the following options: (1) Evaluate for possible CDC waiver (do not
place trainee into Training Status Code T); (2) Withdraw the Airman for failing
to progress, place into Training Status Code T, and pursue separation; (3)
Withdraw the Airman for failing to progress, place into Training Status Code T,
request Air Force specialty code withdrawal, and recommend retraining or return
to a previously awarded Air Force specialty code; or (4) Withdraw Airman for
failing to progress, place into Training Status Code T, reevaluate at 90 days,
and pursue either option 1, 2, or 3 as appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 12C Community
College of the Air Force</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>12.12. Community College of the Air Force:</span></b></p>

<p><span>12.12.1. The Community
College of the Air Force is the largest community college in the world and is
the only community college in the Department of Defense exclusively for
enlisted personnel. The mission of the Community College of the Air Force is to
offer and award job-related associate in applied science degrees and other
academic credentials that enhance mission readiness, contribute to recruiting,
assist in retention and support the career transitions of Air Force enlisted
members. Community College of the Air Force awards the associate in applied
science degree to enlisted members of the Regular Air Force, Air National
Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command. Community College of the Air Force offers
over 70 degree programs in 5 general areas: (1) Aircraft and Missile
Maintenance; (2) Allied Health; (3) Electronics and Telecommunications; (4) Logistics
and Resources; and (5) Public and Support Services. Enlisted Airmen may only
participate in degree programs specifically designed for their Air Force
occupational specialty. Community College of the Air Force also offers programs
and other academic credentials that support professional development,
professional certification, and recognition opportunities.</span></p>

<p><span>12.12.2.
The Community College of the Air Force was activated in 1972 to gain academic
recognition for formal technical training conducted by Air Force schools. From
1980 to 2004, Community College of the Air Force was independently accredited
by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.
Today, Community College of the Air Force shares in Air University's regional accreditation
through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on
Colleges.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.12.3. The Community
College of the Air Force administrative center is located at Maxwell Air Force
Base, Gunter Annex, Alabama. More than 6,500 instructors assigned to more than
100 affiliated schools deliver more than 2,000 degreeapplicable courses for
which collegiate credit is earned. Each year more than 1.6 million semester
hours are earned in Community College of the Air Force classrooms. To date,
Community College of the Air Force has awarded more than 480,000 associate of
applied science degrees.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.12.4. A<b>ssociate in
Applied Science Degree.</b>&nbsp;Associate degrees earned in professional,
technical or terminal programs are frequently called associate of applied
science degrees. The educational standard for the associate in applied science
degree is to be designed for those students who plan to seek employment based
upon the competencies and skills attained through these programs and to offer
the academic, technical and professional knowledge and skills required for job
acquisition, retention and advancement. While not designed to meet the needs of
students who transfer to a four-year institution, portions of these programs
may do so. Community College of the Air Force offers and awards the associate
in applied science degree designed to provide graduates with knowledge, skills
and theoretical background for enhanced performance as technicians within their
respective Air Force occupational specialty. This is accomplished by combining
collegiate credit earned through completed formal technical training courses
delivered at affiliated military schools and general education courses
completed from accredited civilian colleges. Since enlisted Airmen are
constantly relocating in performance of their duties, Community College of the
Air Force provides a means for them to complete degree requirements regardless
of where they are assigned. One way the Community College of the Air Force
helps enlisted Airmen to progress toward completing degree requirements while
deployed, on temporary duty, or at multiple duty locations is through General
Education Mobile. General Education Mobile identifies civilian colleges that
provide distance learning courses approved by the Community College of the Air
Force in meeting degree program general education requirements. This prevents
Airmen from completing unnecessary courses that would not apply toward degree
graduation requirements, eliminates waste of military tuition assistance funds,
and prevents wasting Airmen's time and efforts.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.12.5.
Enlisted Airmen are automatically registered in the Community College of the
Air Force degree program designed for their Air Force occupational specialty
during the fourth week of Basic Military Training. Each degree program consists
of 64 semester hours and combines Air Force formal technical training and
education with a core of general education requirements obtained from
accredited civilian colleges or nationally recognized examination programs. To
graduate, students must complete the 64 semester-hour academic requirements,
hold at least the Journeyman 5-skill level (or equivalent), and have a minimum
of 16 semester hours of Community College of the Air Force residency credit
applied toward the degree program. Residency is defined as credit earned in a
Community College of the Air Force affiliated school or credit awarded for
occupational specialty progression. Table 12.1 identifies the requirements for
the typical Community College of the Air Force degree and the semester-hour
requirements in each subject area.</span></p>

<p><span>12.12.6.&nbsp;<b>Collegiate
Credit.</b>&nbsp;Community College of the Air Force awards collegiate academic
credit for degree-applicable courses delivered at affiliated military schools.
However, not all Air Force training courses are awarded Community College of
the Air Force academic credit. The college accepts credit in transfer from
accredited colleges to be applied toward specific degree program requirements.
General education courses accepted in transfer from civilian colleges must meet
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges
accreditation and Community College of the Air Force requirements. Refer to the
Community College of the Air Force General Catalog for policies concerning acceptance
of civilian general education courses in transfer. Community College of the Air
Force also researches and awards technical credit for degree-applicable federal
and civilian professional credentials (certifications, licensures, and
registries). Students may earn Community College of the Air Force collegiate
credit for specific national professional credentials that are approved by the
college to satisfy applicable degree program technical education and program
elective requirements. To determine which professional credentials can be
awarded credit and used in a specific degree program, refer to the current
Community College of the Air Force General Catalog at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/"><span>http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/</span></a><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/"><span>.</span></a></p>

processes benefits the Air Force by molding a more diverse and qualified
workforce to maintain critical and valuable national defense assets. The Airman
benefits by being provided the education and credentials needed in highly
technical Air Force career fields. The Airman will also possess highly valued
skills needed by industry when he or she transitions out of the Air Force. The
end result is industry benefits immensely by receiving a highly trained,
qualified, experienced, and disciplined employee, which is a valuable payback
of investments. To support documentary evidence of training, skills, and
practical experience, Airmen are highly encouraged to maintain records of all
previous and current education, training, and qualifications.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 12D Education</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>12.15.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Educational</b>&nbsp;<b>Financial Assistance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Voluntary Education
Program supports long-range Air Force goals for maintaining a high-quality
force and enhancing professional and personal development, recruitment,
retention, and readiness. The Air Force offers three programs for enlisted
personnel to help defray the cost of obtaining off-duty education:</span></p>

<p><span>12.15.1.<b>&nbsp;Military Tuition Assistance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To
assist individuals in furthering their education, the Air Force provides a
tuition assistance program (with some restrictions) to all eligible Air Force
members. As of 1 October 2014, the Air Force pays the cost of tuition only at
accredited institutions not to exceed the hourly and annual caps established by
DoDI 1322.25,&nbsp;<i>Voluntary Education</i>&nbsp;<i>Programs,</i>&nbsp;and
AFI 36-2649,&nbsp;<i>Voluntary Education</i>&nbsp;<i>Program.</i>&nbsp;These
funds are not taxed thus lowering the tax deduction in an Airman's paycheck. Air
Force members cannot use tuition assistance to purchase textbooks, ebooks,
career development courses/DVDs, references/instructional materials, electronic
equipment/supplies, certificate/license examinations and all fees regardless of
applicability to course enrollment or institutional reimbursement policy.
Students using military tuition assistance whose tuition exceeds the semester
hour cap may use the top-up benefit in their Montgomery GI Bill or Post 9/11 GI
Bill to cover the remaining portion.</span></p>

<p><span>12.15.2.<b>&nbsp;Montgomery GI Bill.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Eligible individuals who
entered the service for the first time on or after 1 July 1985 are enrolled in
the Montgomery GI Bill. Members who participate have their pay reduced by $100
a month for the first 12 months. What looks like a contribution of $1,200 is
actually a little more than $900 because no taxes are paid on the $1,200.
Participants may also elect to contribute an additional $600, which adds a
maximum of $5,400 to the total benefit package. Inservice use of the Montgomery
GI Bill is permitted after 2 years of continuous Regular Air Force. Benefits
expire 10 years after separation or retirement.&nbsp;<b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The
amount of the total benefit is adjusted each year in relation to the cost of
living index.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>12.15.3.<b>&nbsp;Post-9-11 GI Bill.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Eligible
individuals who were on Regular Air Force on or after 11 September 2001 may
choose to enroll in this new GI Bill. This program allows some Airmen to
transfer GI Bill benefits to dependents if they have sufficient retainability.
The details and benefits of this GI Bill are not the same as the Montgomery GI
Bill. The decision to move to this program is irrevocable, so Airmen are
requested to get full details from the Veteran's Administration at&nbsp;</span><a href="file://RNDAP01302/TE/AADD/2013%20PDG/Final%20Word%20Docs%20for%20PDF%20file/www.va.gov"><span>www.va.gov</span></a><a href="file://RNDAP01302/TE/AADD/2013%20PDG/Final%20Word%20Docs%20for%20PDF%20file/www.va.gov"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><b><span>12.16. College Credit by Examination.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Military members may
earn college credits through examination. Individuals may earn up to as much as
60 semester hours of college credit at no financial cost by doing well on the
examinations. However, the amount of semester hours accepted by an academic
institution is dependent on the policies of the accepting institution. The two
major types of examinations available to military personnel are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span>12.16.1.<b>&nbsp;Defense Activity for
Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES).</b></span></p>

<p><span>The DANTES subject
standardized tests are a series of tests for obtaining academic credit for
college-level knowledge. The DANTES subject standardized tests are essentially
course achievement tests. Each DANTES subject standardized tests is based on
several textbooks commonly used for a course of the same or similar title. Some
of the DANTES subject standardized tests include law enforcement, business,
natural science, social science and history, and mathematics.</span></p>

<p><span>12.16.2.<b>&nbsp;The College-Level Examination
Program (CLEP).</b></span></p>

<p><span>The CLEP measures
college-level competency. The  general  CLEP tests measure college-level
achievement in the five basic areas required for college freshmen and
sophomores: English composition, humanities, mathematics, natural science, and
social science and history. Additional tests are available in subject areas
that include business, English literature, information systems, sociology,
psychology, history, management, and foreign language.</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.17. Enlisted-to-Air Force Institute of
Technology (AFIT) Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>12.17.1.

<p><b><span>12.19. Commissioning Programs.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Enlisted members can
obtain a commission while on Regular Air Force through one of the various
commissioning programs. A few of the most common programs include:</span></p>

<p><span>12.19.1.&nbsp;<b>Officer Training School.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Eligibility for a
commission through Officer Training School requires military members to possess
a baccalaureate or higher degree from an accredited college or university. AFI
36-2013,&nbsp;<i>Officer Training School (OTS) and Enlisted Commissioning
Programs (ECPS),&nbsp;</i>contains specific guidance. Additionally, the base
education services office has information and can provide assistance.</span></p>

<p><span>12.19.2.<b>&nbsp;Leaders Encouraging Airmen
Development (LEAD).</b></span></p>

<p><span>The LEAD Program
delegates authority to unit and wing commanders to nominate highly qualified
Airmen to become Air Force officers via United States Air Force Academy
attendance. Depending on level of qualifications, nominations may lead to
direct entry to United States Air Force Academy, entry to the United States Air
Force Academy Preparatory School, or referral to other programs.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>12.19.3.<b>&nbsp;Scholarships for Outstanding
Airmen to Reserve Officer Training Corps (SOAR) Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>SOAR
offers Regular Air Force enlisted personnel the opportunity to earn a
commission while completing their bachelor's degree as an Air Force Reserve
Officer Training Corps cadet. Those selected separate from the Regular Air
Force Air Force and join an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps detachment
to become full-time college students. The Air Force provides them with a
tuition and fees scholarship of up to $15,000 per year, an annual textbook
allowance, and a monthly nontaxable stipend. Award of this scholarship is for 2
to 4 years, depending on how many years remain in the student's bachelor's degree
program. Airmen with some or no college credit may apply for the program. A
limited number of SOAR selects are offered a scholarship with no tuition cap.
This program is open to students in any major. Upon graduation and completion
of the program, students are commissioned as second lieutenant and returned to
Regular Air Force (typically within 60 days of commissioning) for at least 4
years.</span></p>

<p><span>12.19.4.<b>&nbsp;Air Force Reserve Officer
Training Corps Airman Scholarship and Commissioning Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This
program allows military members to receive an Air Force Reserve Officer
Training Corps scholarship to attend a college or university of their choice,
provided the college or university offers an Air Force Reserve Officer Training
Corps program. If selected for this program, the member is discharged from
Regular Air Force and enlisted into the Air Force Inactive Obligated Reserve.
Upon completion of the degree and the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps
requirements, the member receives an Air Force commission.</span></p>

<p><b><span>12.20. Air University Associate-to-Baccalaureate
Cooperative Program (AU-ABC).</span></b></p>

<p><span>12.20.1.<b>&nbsp;Vision.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
vision of Air Force leaders is to provide distance learning and bachelor s
degree opportunities for Airmen. The AU-ABC aligns with this Air Force vision
and meets the Air University near-term goal of providing enhanced educational
opportunities for our enlisted force. The AU-ABC initiative establishes
partnerships between the Air Force and accredited civilian higher education
institutions to offer baccalaureate degree opportunities via distance learning.
AU-ABC links Airmen who have completed associate degrees to  military
supportive  baccalaureate programs. AU-ABC applies Community College of the Air
Force associate degree credit toward baccalaureate degrees and requires
participants to complete no more than 60 semester hours after having earned an
Associate of Applied Science degree. AU-ABC degree programs are linked to one
or more Air Force-relevant degree programs currently offered by Community
College of the Air Force. To participate, registrants must be serving in the
Regular Air Force, Air Force Reserves, or Air National Guard. Baccalaureate
degree requirements may be completed after a student retires or separates from
the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>12.20.2.<b>&nbsp;Program Plans.</b></span></p>

<p><span>AU-ABC programs are

<p align="center"><b><span>RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 13A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>With the constant focus
on efficiency, the Air Force must get the greatest return from every
investment. People are one of the most important resources. This chapter
provides valuable information to consider when managing resources and
personnel. Also, everyone must safeguard Air Force property and protect it from
fraud, waste, and abuse; and resource management requires all members be
sensitive to environmental issues. This chapter provides an overview of
resource management and identifies many of the Air Force environmental
programs.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 13B Traits of a
Healthy Team</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.2. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>As leaders, we must
develop effective teams to accomplish the mission. While building effective
teams, we must cultivate a healthy team spirit. The spirit in which a team
operates influences every stage of team development and can ultimately
determine whether mission goals are met. A healthy team spirit is the engine
that runs high performance teams. Five critical attributes are present in all
healthy teams: trust, ethical behavior, critical judgment, sharing, and
cooperation. While each is essential in building a healthy team spirit, trust
is the core of all healthy team interaction.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.3.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Trust:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.3.1. Trust is
essential in forming any good relationship; teamwork requires good
relationships with a high degree of trust. Team members must share mutual
confidence in the integrity and ability of teammates. They also need to feel
comfortable enough to take risks, think outside the box, and share their
thoughts and ideas without fear of being shut down or discounted. Freedom to
communicate openly, honestly, and directly within the group is the hallmark of
a trust-based team. Individuals must understand the importance of utilizing
effective communication skills to develop the level of trust needed for the
teams to grow. These communication skills include positive listening habits
such as maintaining good eye contact, recalling essential information, allowing
individuals to speak freely with minimal to no interruptions, as well as
responding in the appropriate manner. In her book&nbsp;<i>"Teams at
Work,"</i>&nbsp;author, organizational consultant, and Institute for
Planning and Development founder Dr. Suzanne Zoglio wrote  Nothing reduces
trust in a group faster than members saying one thing within the group and
something else outside the group. When members are assertive enough to say what
they need to say directly to the appropriate people and to refrain from talking
behind each other's backs, trust is enhanced. </span></p>

<p><span>13.3.2. Team members may
respond to other team members they do not trust by alienating them, ignoring
their inputs, and withholding vital information. Trust is important in creating
a healthy team because information needs to be shared and accepted in good
faith. Feedback must also be exchanged between members in an open and sincere
manner without fear of harsh criticism. Without trust, a team's efforts can be
sabotaged and progress brought to a grinding halt. Leaders can promote a
trusting atmosphere by being trustworthy and by trusting their workers.
Additionally, by valuing individual differences and encouraging open and honest
communication, leaders empower their teams to solve problems innovatively
through a shared sense of collaboration that is free of self-preservation and
one's own personal interest.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>13.3.3. While there are
many strategies that can be utilized for building trust within a team, leaders
should focus their efforts on leading by example and developing a trusting
relationship within the team; communicate openly and honestly; know team
members and establish a good rapport with team members; discourage cliques or
divisions within the team; and finally, discuss trust issues with the team.
Remember, trust is earned and can be lost.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.4. Ethical Behavior.</span></b></p>

<p><span>We lose trust in people
because of behaviors that reduce our respect for them. Such behaviors are
usually unethical and kill the spirit of the team. Ethical behaviors, on the
other hand, conform to accepted principles of right and wrong that govern our
profession. Team members who exhibit honesty, integrity, and concern for doing
what is right behave ethically. In his book&nbsp;<i>"Essentials of
Management,"</i>&nbsp;author and Professor of Management, College of
Business at Rochester Institute of Technology, Andrew J. DuBrin said  To a
strong team player, getting the group task accomplished is more important than
receiving individual recognition.  He also outlined the underlying reasons as
to why unethical behavior arises in the team. The primary cause can be closely
contributed to one's  values .</span></p>

<p><span>13.4.1.
Ethics and values operate as a synchronous unit and is often driven by
individual personal interests within the team. Teams will often experience
turmoil when self-interest or greed enters the team; unconscious biases may
lead to stereotypes and affect the judgement of the team; and the likelihood
that a team may rationalize or make unethical decisions to complete the task or
reach their goal. When teams operate with high standards and moral values, they
increase trust and therefore work cohesively.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.5. Sharing Information:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.5.1. If teams are to
succeed, they must openly share information inside and outside the group. This
sharing of information involves both active listening and talking. According to
Professor DuBrin,  Information sharing help other team members do their job
well and also communicates concern for their welfare.  Leaders' best
demonstrate concern for the welfare of other team members when they actively
listen.  The active listener strives to grasp both the facts and feelings
behind what is being said,  Professor DuBrin added. Active listening and
information sharing encourage positive, open, and sincere communication among
team members.</span></p>

<p><span>13.5.2.
Teams must communicate. Team members need to safely assert themselves and share
their ideas. Teams that don t allow honest, open sharing quickly lose their
effectiveness. As a result, some team members may purposely withhold vital
information or disengage from the team. This may cause confusion, frustration,
and the inability to complete tasks within teams. While sharing information
between team members is essential in producing effective, well-thought-out
plans. Also essential is for the leader to share information with team members.
When leaders hold on to information, they can create an inaccurate, incomplete,
or totally wrong picture of the expected outcome to team members. Information
sharing yields better results. Leaders can increase team success by giving
members complete access to all necessary data, discouraging the discounting of
ideas and feelings, and encouraging the practice of active listening and
valuing individual differences.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.6. Critical Judgment.</span></b></p>

<p><span>When we share
information, someone is bound to criticize our ideas. For a team to be
effective, constructive criticism should be accepted and encouraged. Professor
DuBrin said,  A high performance team demands sincere and tactful criticism
among members. The willingness to accept constructive criticism increases
self-awareness and improves team effectiveness.  Critical judgment enables
teams to accept intra-group feedback (criticism) and outside evaluations,
necessary to examine processes and practices. By using critical feedback, teams
can redirect their focus and energy, and correct problems quickly rather than
letting them intensify.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>13.6.1.
Giving constructive criticism occurs when teams focus on the problem or
behavior and not necessarily personal opinions; when the negative feedback is
given at the appropriate time and is not introduced during a later stage of
team development; and lastly when the individual is given an opportunity to
observe and self-correct the problem. Critical judgment is essential to ensure
teams consistently focus in the right direction.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.7. Cooperation:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.7.1. Cooperation is critical if teams are to
combine diverse backgrounds, skills, and approaches to meet the challenges,
customer requirements, and mission changes. Cooperation yields synergistic
results and reduces the time it takes to reach a desired outcome. Dr. Zoglio<i>&nbsp;</i>said,
 At work there are so few solo opportunities; most challenges require the
cooperation of many people. Team members must rely on each other to follow
through on assignments, produce quality results, share creative ideas, and
contribute to a pleasant work environment.  Leaders who encourage cooperation
show team members that others have very important contributions to the goals of
the unit. Team members may also come to understand how dependent they are on
one another in reaching mission objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>13.7.2.
Dr. Zoglio further states that successful teams manage differences through
win/win negotiating and reach decisions by consensus, rather than voting.
Successful teams have few turf wars, little competitiveness, and an ability to
forgive and forget. Cooperation breeds shared ownership for performance
results, and achieving objectives increases team pride and a healthy team
spirit. Conversely, competition hinders the cooperative process, as some team
members attempt to outshine others to gain extra attention. Such  all-starring 
leads to in-fighting, making the team less productive.  All-starring  may also
be evidence of a power struggle. To reduce power-play behavior, leaders should
reemphasize each team member's specific roles and responsibilities, which
eliminates potential barriers to cooperation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.8. Healthy Team Spirit Summary.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Cultivating a healthy
team spirit requires trust, ethical behavior, critical judgment, sharing, and
cooperation. Trust is at the heart of any healthy team interaction. Team
members must feel comfortable with, and confident in, one another to be able to
fully participate and share their ideas and feelings. Positive group member
behaviors establish the climate of trust needed to develop a healthy team
spirit. Ethical behavior requires members do what is legally, morally, and
professionally right for one another and the organization. Such behavior is
essential to the communication a team needs to accomplish its goals. Leaders
must establish a healthy team spirit to drive performance and develop effective
teams to accomplish the mission.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 13C Managing
Resources Other Than Personnel</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.9. Resource Management System:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.9.1.<b>&nbsp;Resource Management System
Defined.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Resource management
system does not refer to a single system. Instead, the Air Force resource
management system involves various systems focusing on outputs and resources
used, managers effectively using resources, measuring actual performance
compared to planned performance, and using financial plans and accounting to
enhance management controls at each organizational level. The resource
management system provides a way to establish priorities, choose policies, and
act to get the desired results and required resources at an acceptable cost.
Resource management system elements include the execution plan, management and
accounting systems, participatory and committee management, resource management
teams, and resource management training.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Resource Management System
Duties.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force managers
oversee activities that cost money; however, in terms of resources, resource
management system duties refer to the stewardship of money, manpower, and
equipment. Being an effective steward involves more than legal accountability.
Headquarters, United States Air Force and major commands make decisions about
using resources. Although base-level resource managers do not control initial
allocation of all their resources, they must effectively manage these
resources.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Commanders.</b>&nbsp;Financial
management is inherent to command. Commanders review, validate, and balance the
execution plan to ensure successful financial management. They must actively
review financial programs for each work center (responsibility center) that
reports to them and improve resource management by inquiring about program
conditions, reviewing causes, weighing alternatives, and directing action. They
must also ensure resource management system success by allocating sufficient
resources to resource management system training and resource management team
efforts.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Comptrollers.&nbsp;</b>Comptrollers
support the organization's mission and the Air Force by providing sound
financial management and advice to the commander and staff. They promote
responsible and proper financial management to ensure economical and efficient
use of resources consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements. They
apply policies and procedures that enable the organization to carry out
accounting, budget, and cost functions.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.2.3.<b>&nbsp;Responsibility
Center Managers.</b>&nbsp;Responsibility center managers plan, direct, and
coordinate subordinate organizations' activities. They analyze subordinate
organizational plans, identify imbalances in resource distribution, analyze
alternative actions, and balance programs.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Cost
Center Managers.</b>&nbsp;The cost center is the basic production flight or
work center. The cost center manager regulates the consumption of work hours,
supplies, equipment, and services to do the tasks within their cost center.
Cost center managers shift resources to or from various production tasks within
the cost center to ensure the proper mix or to provide the emphasis required.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Resource
Advisors.</b>&nbsp;Resource advisors monitor and help prepare resource
estimates. They help develop obligations and expense fund targets, monitor the
use of resources in daily operations compared to projected consumption levels,
and serve as the primary point of contacts on resource management matters
pertaining to their responsibility center. Resource advisors are appointed in
writing by the responsibility center manager.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.3.<b>&nbsp;The Financial Management Board.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Established
by the senior or host commander at each base, the financial management board
determines program priorities and ensures effective allocation of resources.
The financial management board reviews and approves or disapproves
recommendations made by the financial working group to ensure balanced, valid
financial programs and to consider all known or anticipated requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>13.9.4.<b>&nbsp;The Financial Working Group.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Composed
of both line and staff resource advisors and responsibility center managers,
the financial working group manages commodities and resources integral to the operating
activities of the base or unit. The financial working group develops
requirements and revisions for the base or unit execution plan, reviews all
appropriated fund execution plans, and makes recommendations to the financial
management board for final approval. Additionally, the financial working group
presents recommendations to the financial management board for unfunded
requirement prioritization and fund target adjustments between responsibility
centers, and base-level budgetary guidance. The financial working group
provides technical guidance to base activities on using their primary
responsibility resources.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.10.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Effective Use of Government Property:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.10.1.<b>&nbsp;Supply Discipline.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force members must
have a supply discipline to conserve, protect, and maintain available
government supplies, equipment, and real property for operational requirements.
The Air Force's mission makes it imperative that all military and civilian
personnel operate and maintain government systems, equipment, supplies, and
real property in the best possible condition, in constant readiness, and in the
absolute minimum quantity necessary to accomplish assigned tasks. Commanders
and supervisors at all levels are responsible for prudent management, control,
storage, and cost-effective use of government property under their control.</span></p>

<p><span>13.10.2.<b>&nbsp;Roles.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Commanders,
subordinates, supervisors, and individuals must:</span></p>

<p><span>13.10.2.1. Accurately
maintain property records to reflect a current inventory and condition of
property.</span></p>

<p><span>13.10.2.2. Ensure
personnel carefully and economically use and safeguard property.</span></p>

<p><span>13.10.2.3. Provide
adequate security, protection, and storage for property.</span></p>

<p><span>13.10.2.4. Make
recommendations for preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.</span></p>

<p><span>13.10.3.<b>&nbsp;Custodial Management of Public
Property.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
property custodian is any person designated by the organization commander or
chief of staff agency responsible for government property in his or her
possession. A custodian must plan and forecast requirements to meet mission
goals, prepare and forward materiel requests to the proper agency, sign custody
receipts or listings for property charged to his or her organization, report
losses or irregularities relating to property to his or her immediate
commanders or accountable officers, and take action to reconcile and correct
property records. A custodian may be held liable for the loss, destruction, or
damage of any property or resources under his or her control.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.11. Financial Management:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.11.1.<b>&nbsp;Use of Resources.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force commanders and
supervisors are responsible for the efficient and economical use of all
resources in their organizations. Commanders and supervisors directly influence
the budgeting, allocation, composition, and distribution of these resources. It
should be noted that every Air Force member is directly involved in and
responsible for managing resources.</span></p>

<p><span>13.11.2.<b>&nbsp;Cost-free Resources.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In
the following types of instances, everyone has a principal responsibility to
ensure resources are used in the most cost-effective manner. Keep in mind, all
Air Force resources, at one time or another, had some kind of cost charged to
get into the Department of Defense inventory. Some resources may appear to be
cost-free assets because Airmen:</span></p>

<p><span>13.11.2.1. May not
either control the determination or allocation of these resources (real
property, weapon systems, and manpower).</span></p>

<p><span>13.11.2.2. May not have
the authority to change the mix of the total resources allocated.</span></p>

<p><span>13.11.3.&nbsp;<b>The Operating Budget.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
operating budget covers costs associated with the operation of all Air Force
organizations. The approval by higher headquarters gives obligation authority
to accomplish the mission. The budget program operates on a fiscal year basis
(fiscal year represents the period beginning the first day of October and
ending the last day of the following September [1 October through 30
September].)</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.12.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Fraud, Waste, and Abuse:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.<b>&nbsp;Fraud, Waste, and Abuse
Defined.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force loses
millions of dollars in money and resources every year due to individuals abusing
the system, wasting precious resources, and committing acts of fraud. Fraud,
waste and abuse is:</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Fraud.&nbsp;</b>Any
intentional deception designed to unlawfully deprive the Air Force of something
of value or to secure from the Air Force for an individual a benefit,
privilege, allowance, or consideration to which he or she is not entitled. Such
practices include, but are not limited to:</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.1.1. Offering,
paying, accepting bribes or gratuities, or evading or corrupting inspectors or
other officials.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.1.2. Making
false statements, submitting false claims, or using false weights or measures.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.1.3. Using
deceit, either by suppressing the truth or misrepresenting material facts, or
deprive the Air Force of something of value.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.1.4.
Adulterating or substituting materials and falsifying records and books of
accounts.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.1.5. Conspiring
to carry out any of the actions in paragraphs 13.12.1.1.1 through 13.12.1.1.4.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.1.6.
Engaging in conflict of interest cases, criminal irregularities, and the
unauthorized disclosure of official information relating to procurement and
disposal matters.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;For purposes of this handbook, the
definition can include any theft or diversion of resources for personal or
commercial gain.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Waste.</b>&nbsp;The
extravagant, careless, or needless expenditure of Air Force funds or the
consumption of Air Force property that results from deficient practices,
systems controls, or decisions is waste. Waste also includes improper practices
not involving prosecutable fraud.&nbsp;<b>Note:<i>&nbsp;</i></b>Consider
wartime and emergency operations when explaining possible waste. For example,
legitimate stockpiles and reserves for wartime needs, which may appear
redundant and costly, are not considered waste.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Abuse.&nbsp;</b>The
intentionally wrongful or improper use of Air Force resources is abuse.
Examples include misuse of rank, position, or authority that causes the loss or
misuse of resources such as tools, vehicles, computers, or copy machines.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.2.<b>&nbsp;Preventing Fraud, Waste and
Abuse.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Preventing
fraud, waste and abuse is of primary concern. Detection and prosecution serve
to deter fraudulent, wasteful, or abusive practices; however, the key element
of the program is to prevent the loss of resources. The Secretary of the Air
Force, Inspector General, provides policy guidance, develops procedures, and
establishes and evaluates the Air Force complaints and fraud, waste and abuse
programs. In turn, inspector generals at every level are responsible for
establishing and directing the Air Force complaints and fraud, waste and abuse
programs. Air Force personnel have a duty to promptly report fraud, waste and
abuse to an appropriate supervisor or commander, to an Inspector General or
other appropriate inspector, or through an established grievance channel.
Fraud, waste and abuse complaints may be reported to the Air Force Audit
Agency, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, security forces, or
other proper authorities. Further, all military and civilian members must
promptly advise the Air Force Office of Special Investigations of suspected
criminal misconduct or fraud. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations
investigates criminal allegations.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.<b>&nbsp;Fraud, Waste and Abuse
Complaints:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Resolution.&nbsp;</b>As
with personal complaints, Air Force members should try resolving fraud, waste
and abuse issues at the lowest possible level using command channels before
addressing them to a higher level or the Inspector General. Individuals may
submit:</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.1.1. Fraud, waste
and abuse disclosures by memorandum, in person, or by fraud, waste and abuse
hotlines.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.1.2. Complaints
anonymously.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Making a
disclosure or complaint requires factual, unbiased, and specific information.
Individuals must understand they are submitting official statements within Air
Force channels. Therefore, they remain subject to punitive action (or adverse
administrative action) for knowingly making false statements and for submitting
other unlawful communications. Information in a disclosure or complaint to an
Inspector General is protected.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Complainant
Privacy.</b>&nbsp;The complainant's privacy is safeguarded to the maximum
extent practicable to encourage voluntary cooperation and promote a climate of
openness in identifying issues requiring leadership intervention. The Inspector
General has the responsibility to safeguard the personal identity and
complaints of individuals seeking assistance or participating in an Inspector
General process such as an investigation. While this does not mean the
communications made to an Inspector General are privileged or confidential, it
does mean that disclosure of those communications (and the identity of the
communicant) is strictly limited to an official need-toknow basis.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Disclosure.</b>&nbsp;This
information is not disclosed unless required by law or regulation, when
necessary to take adverse action against a subject, with the approval of the
Secretary of the Air Force, Inspector General.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.4.&nbsp;<b>Summary
of the Results.&nbsp;</b>Individuals making a complaint may request a summary
of the results from the office to which the complaint was made. However,
witnesses (including complainants and subjects) do not have unrestricted access
to reports, complainants, and subjects, or any other case file information by
virtue of their status as a witness. They have access to Inspector General
records as provided for by the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.5.&nbsp;<b>Whistleblower
Rights.</b>&nbsp;Whistleblower witnesses have additional rights. The nature of
the allegation and findings will determine what information is releasable. All
information released is according to Freedom of Information Act and Privacy
Act.  Third-party  complainants are not entitled to a response regarding
alleged wrongs not directly affecting them unless authorized to receive via a
Freedom of Information Act or a Privacy Act release.</span></p>

<p><span>13.12.3.6.&nbsp;<b>Inspector
General Channels.</b>&nbsp;If the Inspector General receives a complaint or
disclosure more appropriate for another channel may be referred to that channel
by the receiving Inspector General. When Inspectors General refer complaints to
command or other more appropriate resolution channels, Inspectors General
notify complainants of the referral, except for anonymous complainants.</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.1.&nbsp;<b>Air Force Policy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
United States Air Force is a leader and devoted guardian of the environment. As
trustee to over 8 million acres of natural habitat, the Air Force takes
considerable measures to defend and enhance America's rich natural resources
and cultural heritage. Over the last 20 years, the Air Force has followed a
compliance-based approach to environmental management resulting in an
unparalleled record of responsiveness to regulation, community interests, and
ecological needs. Yet, to meet current and future mission requirements, the Air
Force environmental program must ensure environmental resources, such as air,
land, and water, are available to meet operational needs. This approach allows
the Air Force to&nbsp;<i>sustain, restore, and modernize&nbsp;</i>their environmental
resources, or "natural infrastructure," in full compliance and
support of military readiness challenges.</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.2.&nbsp;<b>Department
of Defense and Air Force Programs.</b>&nbsp;Per Executive Order 13693,&nbsp;<i>Planning
for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,&nbsp;</i>the Department of
Defense and Air Force established and maintained an environmental management
system. In accordance with Executive Order 13693, the Air Force will continue
to implement and maintain environmental management system to achieve the
performance necessary to sustain compliance, reduce risk, and continuously
improve to achieve sustainability goals. AFI 32-7001,&nbsp;<i>Environmental
Management</i>, implements the environmental management system framework and
provides guidance and procedures applicable to all Air Force installations
within the United States to include the territories, and in foreign countries.
See Figure 13.1 for the environmental management system<i>&nbsp;</i>vision,
programs, and guidance. The environmental management system<i>&nbsp;</i>sustains
and enhances mission capability by:</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.2.1. Maintaining
compliance with all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and policy
requirements. Typically installations will meet environmental Code of Federal
Regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency and implemented
by the States.</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.2.2. Reducing
compliance burden by implementing pollution prevention solutions that reduce

<p><span>13.13.3.&nbsp;<b>Air Force Planning.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force
environmental management system will integrate environmental impact analysis,
operational risk management, and prevention of pollution methodologies in order
to institute sustainable practices across the Air Force mission and reduce both
environmental risk and the Air Force's environmental footprint, and accommodate
new mission as required. Key actions for installation/major command organizations
include:</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.3.1. Documenting
aspects and impacts for the installation's activities, products, and services.
Aspects are elements of the activities, products, and services that can
interact with the environment and produce either a negative or positive
environmental impact.</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.3.2.
For aspects classified as significant, ensure actions to formally manage as
part of the environmental management system, including setting objectives and
targets and establishing action plans. This helps identify the investment to
resource.</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.3.3. The
environmental programming and budgeting process provides the necessary
resources to achieve the goals and objectives of the Air Force strategic plan,
the organizational-level, multi-site or installation environmental management
system, or other major program objectives. Environmental requirements are
entered into Air Forceapproved programming tools/software following Civil
Engineering operations and maintenance programming guides and supplemental
budgeting policy and guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;13.13.4.&nbsp;<b>Air Force Operational
Controls/Performance Monitoring.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Installations shall
ensure adequate operational controls are in place to control, mitigate, or
prevent negative environmental impacts. Operational controls may be physical
(e.g., barrier, secondary containment), engineering (e.g., alarm system), or
administrative (e.g., standard operating procedure, management plan,
checklist).</span></p>

<p><span>13.13.4.1. Develop and

<p><b><i><span>Section 13D Planning,
Programming, Budgeting, and Execution</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.14. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and
Execution Philosophy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The ultimate objective
of the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process is to provide
the best mix of forces, equipment, manpower, and support attainable within
fiscal constraints according to Department of Defense Directive 7045.14,&nbsp;<i>The
Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) Process</i>. The goal of
the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process is to achieve the
defense objectives established by the President and the Secretary of Defense in
the strategic planning and joint planning guidance. The Air Force uses a unique
process for implementing the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution<b><i> </i></b>the
Air Force corporate structure. This structure increases management
effectiveness by applying judgment and experience to programs, resource
limitations, and other program adjustments. This enables senior leadership to
assess alternative ways to achieve the planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution objective. The Air Force develops their program to achieve defense
objectives established by the President and the Secretary of Defense as well as
internal Air Force strategic planning objectives. The formulation of the Air
Force budget is a complicated and time-consuming endeavor. Planning,
programming, budgeting, and execution is a shared process within the Air Force
with significant responsibility delegated to the Director of Programs, Deputy
Chief of Staff for Plans and Programs (AF/A8P), and the Deputy Assistant
Secretary for Budget, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for
Financial Management and Comptroller (SAF/FMB).</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.15. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and
Execution Process.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The planning,
programming, budgeting, and execution process is the Department of Defense s
resource allocation system. This process has a framework that decides on future
capabilities and provides an opportunity to reexamine prior decisions in light
of evolving threats, economic conditions, and security concerns. Finally,
planning, programming, budgeting, and execution is an iterative process
consisting of four interrelated and overlapping phases: planning, programming,
budgeting, and execution.<b>&nbsp;</b>13.15.1.<b>&nbsp;Planning.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force translates
top-down guidance into meaningful plans and requirements for which a program
for the future year's defense program can be developed. Planning defines and
examines alternative strategies and analyzes external conditions and trends.
Planning provides the means to anticipate changes and understand the long-term
implications of near-term choices and decisions. Streamlined planning and
assessment documents help prioritize objectives, assess strategies, and provide
the link between planning and programming. Within the concept of planning,
programming, budgeting, and execution, planning also provides a program
objective against which the Air Force can measure program execution success.</span></p>

<p><span>13.15.2.<b>&nbsp;Programming.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Through
the programming processes, the Air Force and other military department's link
planned requirements with the resources needed to provide them. Inevitably,
this will involve tradeoffs beyond those agreed to in the planning process. By
programming, the Air Force matches available resources (fiscal, manpower, and
materiel) against validated requirements to achieve the strategic plan and
submit program proposals. Planning policies and guidance are addressed and
initial program costs are established. The key objective of programming is to
develop a balanced, capabilities-based Air Force program in the form of the Air
Force program objective memorandum. In addition, through the programming
processes, the Air Force defends the program objective memorandum during
program review and budget review and adjusts the program as a result of the
Office of the Secretary of Defense reviews and changing national and
international situations.</span></p>

<p><span>13.15.3.<b>&nbsp;Budgeting.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The budgeting phase of
planning, programming, budgeting, and execution occurs concurrently with the
programming phase. Each Department of Defense component submits a proposed
budget estimate simultaneously with a program objective memorandum. The
budgeting phase (formulation and justification) provides a platform for a
detailed review of a program's pricing, phasing, and overall capability to be
executed on time and within budget. The budgeting process principally addresses
the years to be justified in the President's budget. Three things happen in the
preparation of the budget estimate submission. First, Air Force budget analysts
identify situations where the program has put Air Force resources at risk of
Office of the Secretary of Defense or Congressional reduction. Second, the
comptroller applies the latest inflation figures, flying hour and manpower
rates, etc. Third, the program is put into the Office of the Secretary of
Defense budget format and budget justification documentation is prepared. Once
these steps are complete, the final position is called the program objective
memorandum/budget estimate submission or program budget review. The budgeting
phase continues with the program budget review submission and fact-of-life
changes via notification document in the off-year. Secretary of the Air Force
for financial management and comptroller is the Air Force lead for budget and
budget execution.</span></p>

<p><span>13.15.4.<b>&nbsp;Budget Execution.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Budget execution focuses
on running the Air Force day to day. Execution is carried out at the
Headquarters Air Force, field operating agency, major command, primary support
unit, wing, and unit level. The Air Force major commands (including the
Headquarters Air Force) are allocated their share of obligation authority to
execute their missions in accordance to approved integrated priority lists for
those programs that are centrally managed. Because the budget being executed in
any given year was actually compiled over a year earlier, you should logically
assume some assumptions on which the budget was based will have changed. Because
change is anticipated, Congress allows some flexibility within the operating
budgets to move resources without requiring their permission but installations
are expected to execute to the integrated priority list for centrally managed
programs. One key part of budget execution is the major command's operations
and maintenance operation plan. Air Force program execution is reviewed during
major command budget execution reviews in February, April (concurrent with the
internal Air Force midyear review), and July.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.16. Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and
Execution Summary.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Every leader contributes
to the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process. Within this
system, leaders help establish and forecast a budget to ensure sufficient funds
are available to accomplish the mission. Thoughtful and accurate estimates on
the local level are extremely important in reflecting the overall Air Force
needs. Wise day-to-day resource management is essential to having an effective
planning, programming, budgeting, and execution process.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 13E Manpower
Management and Competitive Sourcing</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.17. Manpower Resources.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Manpower
is a constrained resource that comprises a large portion of the Air Force
Budget. All missions and programs compete for limited authorized military and
civilian end-strength, established grade distributions, and must comply with
other guidelines as directed by Congress. Manpower must be programmed in
accordance with validated manpower requirements, and within fiscal limits and
acceptable risk identified in defense planning and programming guidance.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.18. Chain of Responsibilities.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Directorate of Manpower, Organization and Resources, Program Development
Division (Headquarters Air Force/A1MP) allocates programmed manpower resources by
command identifier, program element code, resource identification code, and
country State code to the commands directing implementation of approved
programs. Major commands and equivalents translate these manpower resources
into manpower authorizations by updating the unit manpower document. The
installation manpower and organization flight is the liaison between
installation agencies and the major command A1M staff for all manpower and
organization issues.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.19. Manpower Resource Levels:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.19.1.&nbsp;<b>Changing Manpower
Allocations.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Command-specific
military and civilian manpower requirements must be validated by the major
command A1M and approved by Headquarters Air Force A1M before they can be used
in the programming and resourcing process. Before manpower allocations can be
changed, the requesting organization must give reasons for the requested
change. The major command must propose specific tradeoffs if the initiative
requires an increase in military or civilian manpower.</span></p>

<p><span>13.19.2.&nbsp;<b>Accommodating Temporary
Manpower Requirements.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>End-strength will not be
programmed to accommodate cyclical or temporary requirements. Instead major
commands and equivalents should use other means to accomplish their short term
mission or surge workload to include: (1) use available funds and command
civilian employment plans to employ civilians; (2) utilize overtime, temporary
full-time, part-time, or over-hire of civilian personnel; (3) seek support from
the Air Reserve Component via Military Pay Appropriation funds; (4) utilize
temporary duty military and civilian personnel; and (5) seek contract service.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.20. Requirements Determination:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.20.1.&nbsp;<b>General Concept.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Manpower
and organization flight personnel assist Air Force commanders and functional
managers at all levels in mission accomplishment by objectively quantifying
manpower requirements for the distribution of Air Force manpower resources. Key
services of this competency include peacetime manpower standards development,
wartime manpower requirements, and commercial services management actions (for
example, public-private competition, in-sourcing, and business process
reengineering). The foundation of any manpower requirements determination
effort is the application of Continuous Process Improvement methodologies to a
function's processes to make process improvements.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.2.&nbsp;<b>Determining Manpower
Requirements:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.20.2.1. The Air Force
manpower requirements determination process systematically identifies
minimumessential manpower required for the most effective and economical
accomplishment of approved missions and functions within organizational and
resource constraints. To accomplish this, Headquarters Air Force functional
managers work with Headquarters Air Force A1M to determine the appropriate
manpower management tool consistent with resources needed to develop the
manpower standard; the required mix of military, civilian, and/or contract
services; and the required military category (officer or enlisted) and grade.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.2.2. Determining
the correct amount of military manpower required to meet the Air Force's most
stringent wartime missions is key to achieving the National Military Strategy
and the Defense Planning Guidance. The Defense Planning Guidance defines the
planning scenarios used to size and shape the Total Force. These include the
amount of military needed for deployment and fight in-place missions for the
given scenario. Manpower requirements are sized for the most demanding phase of
the scenario construct, including all rotational forces needed for prolonged
conflicts. These scenarios drive force structure and manpower military mix
budgeting decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.3.&nbsp;<b>Organization:&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.20.3.1. The Air Force
must be organized to best use available resources. This requires simple,
streamlined structures designed for seamless transition from peace to war. The
principal characteristics desired in Air Force organizations include mission
orientation, unambiguous command, decentralization, agility, flexibility,
simplicity, and standardization.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.3.2.
Manpower standards are established to ensure work center operations are
efficient and standardized to create the most efficient organization. The
ultimate goal of organizational performance is mission accomplishment. Resource
requirements reflected in a manpower standard should be based on organization
and process design, which most effectively and efficiently accomplishes the
mission. Improving mission effectiveness while maintaining or improving
efficiency should be the goal of any modification to a function's current
organizational or process design.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Efficiency does not
necessarily mean decreasing resources but rather improving the return on the
resources used.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.4.&nbsp;<b>Performance Improvement.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Improving
performance requires both planning and execution. For organizational change
effort effectiveness, they generally must include some redesign and/or
coordination on five fronts. These fronts are related organizational areas to
consider. A change on one front may require actions or changes on another. For
example, changing a process may also require some training or retraining
(people front); the process improvement may affect how technology is used
(technology front); or the process design may require updates to regulations
(policy, legislation, regulation front). The five fronts (see figure 13.2) are:</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Organization
and People.&nbsp;</b>Human resources are the key to future viability and
organizational growth in a continuously learning environment. Although
processes and other front factors may change, focus should remain on providing
workers with appropriate knowledge, skills, experiences, and tools. This will
empower them to learn and act, which will tie their rewards to the
organization's values and measures.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Technology.&nbsp;</b>Technology
is a crucial enabling factor that allows compression of cycles, lead time,
distance, and broader access to information and knowledge assets. Technology
also eliminates barriers between customers and suppliers.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Policies,
Legislation, and Regulations.&nbsp;</b>Changing existing policies, regulations,
and legislation may be required for new processes.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.4.4.&nbsp;<b>Physical
Infrastructure.&nbsp;</b>The physical facilities, equipment, and tools should
be designed to support and maximize changes in workflow, information
technology, and human resources.</span></p>

<p><span>13.20.4.5.&nbsp;<b>Process.&nbsp;</b>The
flow of work and information into, and throughout the organization must be
redesigned using standard Continuous Process Improvement methodologies like
Business Process Engineering, Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.21. Unit Manpower Document.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
unit manning document, used to help manage manpower resources, is a computer
product that lists unit funded and unfunded manpower requirements, and contains
many data elements that identify the unique position attributes. These
attributes include position number, Air Force specialty code, functional
account code, office symbol code, grade, personnel accounting symbol, reason
code, etc. The unit manning document is the primary document that reflects the
manpower required to accomplish the unit mission. The installation manpower and
organization office will periodically, or upon request, supply a unit with an
updated unit manning document. Supervisors should routinely check the unit
manning document for accuracy and use it to track their authorized manpower
strength. Headquarters Air Force A1M and the Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency
often produce reports based on unit manning document data; continuous review of
coding is critical for proper position management. See Figure 13.3.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.22. Manpower Management for Senior Leaders:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.22.1.<b>&nbsp;Keeping Unit Manpower Documents
Current.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The unit manpower
document displays current and projected requirements and can be configured to
display desired fields in various formats. Unit commanders and supervisors may
request a unit manpower document from the installation manpower and
organization flight on an as-needed basis. Typically, the unit manpower point
of contact serves as the liaison between the unit and manpower and organization
flight; thus, work center supervisors should coordinate any unit manpower
document changes, etc., with their unit manpower point of contact.</span></p>

<p><span>13.22.2.<b>&nbsp;Funded and Unfunded
Requirements and the Enlisted Grades Allocation Program:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.22.2.1.
The terms  manpower requirement  and  manpower authorization  are often
misunderstood. A manpower requirement is a statement of manpower needed to
accomplish a job, workload, mission, or program.&nbsp; The two types of
manpower requirements are funded and unfunded. Funded manpower requirements are
those that have been validated and allocated. Funded manpower requirements are
also known as authorizations. Unfunded requirements are validated manpower
needs that are deferred because of budgetary constraints.</span></p>

<p><span>13.22.2.2. Some actions
not only affect authorization levels but can also impact funded grades. The
enlisted grades allocation program is designed to ensure enlisted grades are
equitably allocated to Headquarters Air Force, major commands, field operating
agencies, and direct reporting units, and at the same time not exceed
constraints. A grade imbalance between what is required and what is funded
(authorized) can occur as a result of legislative and budgetary constraints on
the allocated grades. For example, Chief Master Sergeants are constrained to 1
percent of the total enlisted force.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>13.22.2.3. Headquarters
Air Force implements congressional and Department of Defense grade constraints
by creating grade factors. Two types of factors created and distributed are:
(1) overall command grade factors for each enlisted grade; and (2) career
progression group factors for each Air Force specialty code to the first three
digits. Command grade factors ensure authorized grades do not exceed
command-ceiling constraints. The career progression group factors ensure
equitable allocation of the grades within each Air Force specialty code in each
command. Both types of factors are applied to the budgeted end-strength. Air Force
career field managers can recommend adjustments to Head Quarters Air Force A1M,
Directorate of Manpower, Organization and Resources. When making adjustments,
they must maintain a zero balance of total grades allocated for each command.
Commands may engage in grade swaps, via the Air Force career field manager,
which in-turn may impact the respective factors. The factors themselves cannot
be swapped.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.23. Initiating and Tracking Manpower Changes:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.23.1.
Periodically, a unit may need to change an existing requirement on the unit
manning document. An authorization change request (may also be referred to as
 manpower change request ) is used to request this change. The unit point of
contact identifies the requested change and provides detailed justification to
the servicing manpower, organization and resources flight. The manpower and
organization section evaluates the request, enters it into the manpower
programming and execution system, and makes a recommendation for approval or
disapproval to the major command.</span></p>

<p><span>13.23.2. Many actions
necessitate an authorization change request. Some of the most frequent are Air
Force specialty code changes, position realignments, redistribution of funding
from a funded requirement to an unfunded requirement, and grade conversions.
Many factors must be considered when a unit proposes a change. Common
considerations include: (1) determining how the change affects the
organizational structure; (2) ensuring the manpower realignment does not exceed
the requirements allowed by Air Force manpower standards; (3) ensuring the
requested change complies with current programming guidelines; and (4) ensuring
the requested change does not adversely impact the unit's ability to deploy or
perform its wartime mission.</span></p>

<p><span>13.23.3.
Changes to the unit manning document must be processed within resource
constraints (i.e. no net increase in resources) minus no net increase in
resources, grades, etc. For example, if a unit wants to fund a position that is
currently unfunded, a funded position must be identified for conversion to
unfund and detailed rationale for the change provided. The servicing manpower
and organization flight will work closely with the unit point of contact when
developing an authorization change request. Unit commander approval of
authorization change request actions is required prior to submission of the
authorization change request to the major command point of contact with the
exception of actions resulting from a public-private competition or in-sourcing
initiative.</span></p>

<p><span>13.23.4.
Approved changes to the unit manning document are reflected by an authorization
change notice generated by the manpower programming and execution system. The
authorization change notice provides details of the approved change and the
rationale for the change. The manpower and organization flight will, in turn,
provide a copy of the authorization change notice to the affected unit's point
of contact. If the request is disapproved, the major command provides rationale
to the submitting unit through the servicing manpower and organization flight.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.24. Manpower and Organization Flight.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
installation manpower and organization flight performs a variety of functions
to help effectively manage manpower resources. The core competencies of the
manpower and organization flight encompass organization structure, requirement
determination, program allocation and control, and process improvement.
Personnel within the manpower and organization flight provide day-to-day
manpower resource management services to include unit manning document
management, assisting with authorization change requests, authorization change
notices, and organizational structure changes. Manpower and organization flight
personnel also provide other management services, such as performance management,
commercial activity services, Airmen Powered by Innovation Program, Continuous
Process Improvement and management advisory studies.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.25. Commercial Services Management:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.<b>&nbsp;Purpose.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Commercial
services management is a program designed to improve functions using a variety
of management tools including competitive sourcing, in-sourcing, and
post-competition accountability. The three principal goals of commercial
services management are to sustain readiness, improve performance and quality
by doing business more efficiently and cost effectively, and focus available
personnel and resources on core Air Force missions. Commercial services
management will not affect military-essential skills or those functions that
are inherently governmental.</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.1. Military
Essential skills are defined as skills that:</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.1.1. Directly
contribute to the prosecution of war (combat or direct combat support).</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.1.2. Exercise
Uniform Code of Military Justice authority.</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.1.3. By law must
be filled with military personnel.</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.1.4. Are
military by custom or tradition (for example, bands and honor guards).</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.1.5. Are needed
to support overseas rotations and to sustain certain career fields.</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.1.6. Are not
available in the private sector.</span></p>

<p><span>13.25.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Inherently
Governmental Function.</b>&nbsp;The Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of
1998 defines an inherently governmental function as one that is so intimately
related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government
employees. Functions may include the determination of budget policy, guidance,
and strategy; the determination of the content and application of policies and
regulations; the selection of individuals for federal government employment;
and obligating money on behalf of the government. For example, warranted
contracting officers are inherently governmental because they are responsible
for making decisions on behalf of the government. They are the signature
authority for committing government funds. The entire contracting staff,
however; does not necessarily satisfy the same criteria. Contracting personnel
who research and provide information, advice, etc., to the warranted
contracting officers do not necessarily have to be government personnel.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.26. Competitive Sourcing Process.</span></b></p>

<p><span>AFI 38-203,&nbsp;<i>Commercial
Activities Program</i>, defines a structured process for determining whether to
perform work inhouse or through contract.</span></p>

<p><span>13.26.1.&nbsp;<b>Competitive Sourcing Study:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.26.1.1.
A competitive sourcing study is a public-private competition that compares the
total cost of the in-house government operation of an activity to the total
cost of private sector performance of the same activity. The study results
determine whether a commercial activity can be done more economically and efficiently
by contract or by an in-house workforce.</span></p>

<p><span>13.26.1.2.
During the competitive sourcing study, the in-house government operation is
reengineered into a most efficient organization and submitted in the
competition as the agency's tender which is the government's proposal for how
it will perform the work. The process of developing a most efficient
organization emphasizes innovation in meeting the requirements laid out in the
solicitation for the work being completed. The most efficient organization is allowed
latitude in its organization and processes outside of the standard Air Force
structure to enable greater efficiency and effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span>13.26.2.&nbsp;<b>Competitive Sourcing Impact:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.26.2.1.
Air Force policy is to minimize both the adverse effects on personnel and the
disruption to the affected organizations. Adversely affected personnel are
provided the right of first refusal for contractor jobs, for which they are
qualified, in the event the government is unable to place them in other federal
positions.</span></p>

<p><span>13.26.2.2. Competitive
sourcing generates savings by finding more efficient ways to accomplish a
particular function. A competitive sourcing study also frees up military
personnel to perform other core military essential activities. In a competitive
sourcing study, the mission remains essentially unchanged; the composition of
the workforce is what changes. Where blue suiters were initially performing the
mission, the resulting service provider will be made up of either civil
servants or private sector contract employees.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.27. In-sourcing:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.27.1.<b>&nbsp;Origin and Authorization:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.27.1.1.
In-sourcing is the conversion of a contracted function to Department of Defense
civilian or military performance, or any combination thereof. Although OMB
Circular A-76 provides a structured process for converting contracts to
in-house performance through public-private competition, 10 United States Code,
Section 2463,&nbsp;<i>Guidelines and Procedures for Use of Civilian Employees
to Perform Department of Defense Functions</i>, permits Department of Defense
components to convert contracts without applying the Circular's requirements.
10 United States Code, Section 2463 provides for special consideration to using
Department of Defense civilian employees to perform any function that is currently
performed by a contractor and meets any of the following criteria:</span></p>

<p><span>13.27.1.1.1. Has been
performed by Department of Defense civilian employees at any time during the
previous 10 years.</span></p>

<p><span>13.27.1.1.2. Is closely
associated with the performance of an inherently governmental function.</span></p>

<p><span>13.27.1.1.3. Has been
performed pursuant to a contract awarded on a noncompetitive basis.</span></p>

<p><span>13.27.1.1.4. Has been
determined by a contracting officer to have been performed poorly during the 5
years preceding the date of such determination, because of excessive costs or
inferior quality.</span></p>

<p><span>13.27.1.2.
Furthermore, in accordance with the Deputy Secretary of Defense memorandum,
In-sourcing contracted services-implementation guidance, contracted functions
found to be inherently governmental, exempt from contract performance,
unauthorized personal services, or experiencing problems associated with
contract administration shall be in-sourced regardless of cost.</span></p>

<p><span>13.27.2.<b>&nbsp;In-sourcing Business Case
Analysis:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.27.2.1. An insourcing
Business Case Analysis compares the cost of a contracted function to the cost
of Department of Defense civilian employees to perform the same activity. The
Business Case Analysis justifies the decision to in-source when based on cost.
Included in the Business Case Analysis are certifications validating contract
cost, in-house manning, available labor pool, and activity meets the
requirements of a valid and enduring mission requirement. Installations and
major commands develop Business Case Analysis, and Air Force manpower analysis
agency validates Business Case Analysis as part of the Air Force in-sourcing
approval process. Cost models are built using COMPARE, an Air Force manpower
analysis agency provided tool that incorporates guidance and factors to
estimating and comparing the full costs of civilian and military manpower and
contract Support.</span></p>

<p><span>13.27.2.2. If new or
expanded requirements or functions performed under contract are determined to
be inherently governmental or exempt from private sector performance for
reasons stated in DoDI 1100.22,&nbsp;<i>Policy and Procedures for Determining
Workforce Mix</i>, the functions shall be converted to government performance
without an economic analysis. In all other cases a cost comparison is required
and serves as the key component of the Business Case Analysis.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.28. Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Headquarters
Air Force A1M is responsible for implementing the Air Force commercial services
management program.&nbsp; Air Force manpower analysis agency develops and
maintains tools, templates, and guidebooks to enable the field to execute the
program, administers the inherently governmental/commercial activities
inventory, monitors post competition accountability, and provides field support
on commercial services management initiatives. Major command A1M is the
manpower function responsible for providing commercial services management
oversight at command levels and providing guidance to manpower and organization
flights for implementation of the commercial services management program at the
respective wings.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 13F Government
Property and Equipment</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.29. General Responsibilities:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.29.1. The Air Force
mission requires that all military and civilian personnel operate and maintain
Government systems, equipment, supplies, and real property in the best possible
condition, in constant readiness, and in the absolute minimum quantity
necessary to accomplish assigned tasks.</span></p>

<p><span>13.29.2.
Commanders must manage public property under their control, including proper
care and use, provide instructions to subordinates on their specific
responsibilities, and maintain records that may be audited. Commanders and
supervisors establish controls to eliminate uneconomical equipment management,
ensure all personnel are taught proper care and safeguard principles, and
enforce these principles. Logistics readiness squadrons offer training on a
variety of topics for different management levels. Commanders appoint
representatives and ensure the representatives attend the proper training. For
example, primary and alternate equipment custodians attend mandatory Block III
computer-based training accompanied by a supplemental Block III training
provided by the logistics readiness squadron's equipment accountability
element.</span></p>

<p><span>13.29.3.
The Air Force equipment management system provides a standard equipment
management system applicable to all Air Force activities. This system is
web-enabled and requires a password for access. Air Force equipment management
system provides worldwide visibility of all in-use and warehoused equipment
assets and is used to report capitalized asset depreciation, determine
equipment requirements based on Air Force allowance standards, support the
budget and buy program, and report equipment types and quantities required to
accomplish the mission. The allowance standards are provided both online in the
Air Force equipment management system and offline via compact disk. The
allowance standards include specific items and authorized quantities required
for the wartime and peacetime needs of each unit.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.30. Property Accounting.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The organization
commander or equivalent designates a property custodian for Government property
used by the unit and listed on allowance standard documents. Upon assuming
responsibility and at least annually, the designated property custodian must
perform an inventory of all assets. The custodian signs the custodian
authorization/custody receipt listing acknowledging completion of the inventory
and signifying all items listed are being used properly and maintained in
serviceable condition. After the inventory is completed, the custodian signs
the acknowledgement of responsibility block which allows the custodian to
become accountable for the property physically in possession, then obtains the
commander's signature as validation that the inventory took place and actions
are underway to resolve discrepancies. The property custodian is relieved of
responsibility only when the account is transferred to another custodian,
issues or turns in items and obtains a signed receipt, or provides authorized adjustment
documents (turn-in receipts, transfer documents, etc.).</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.31. Report of Survey.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A report of survey is
used to research and investigate the cause of loss, damage, destruction, or
theft of Government property and to determine if the cause of loss was
attributable to an individual's negligence or abuse. The final report is used
to assess financial liability against the persons responsible or to relieve
them from liability if there is no evidence of negligence, willful misconduct,
or deliberate unauthorized use of the property. The report of survey also
serves as a source document to adjust accountable records and provides a tool
for commanders to identify deficiencies requiring corrective action to prevent
recurring incidents. AFMAN 23-220,&nbsp;<i>Reports of Survey for Air Force
Property,</i>&nbsp;identifies procedures for processing a report of survey and
implementing the report of survey program.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.1.<b>&nbsp;When to Complete a Report of
Survey:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.31.1.1.<i>&nbsp;</i>With
some exceptions, a report of survey must be completed for all Government
property lost, damaged, destroyed, or stolen. The property can be real or
personal. Air Force real property includes buildings and items attached to
them, such as air-conditioners and compressors. Anything not real property,
such as parkas, tools, desks, equipment, and vehicles is personal property.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.1.2. A report of
survey is not necessary when:</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.1.2.1. The
individual responsible for the loss or damage makes voluntary payment, and
loss, damage, destruction, or theft of property is $500 or less. This policy
does not prevent the initiation of a report of survey if the loss is less than
$500, evidence of negligence, or a systematic loss of property by the same
individual over a period of time.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.1.2.2.
Investigation of the loss, damage, or destruction of a vehicle indicates no
evidence of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized
use. The commander may still take action against individuals in these cases
using punitive or administrative options.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.1.2.3. Do not use
assessment of financial liability as a form of disciplinary action.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.2.<b>&nbsp;Initiating a Report of Survey:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.31.2.1.<i>&nbsp;</i>Generally,
the organization possessing the lost or damaged property is responsible for
initiating a report of survey even if the property is deployed or issued on a
hand-receipt outside the organization.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.2.2. Depending on
the organizational structure, the commander normally initiates the proceedings
by appointing an investigating official. The investigating official will be an
officer, senior NCO, or civilian employee (General Schedule-7, Wage Grade-9,
Wage Leader-5, or Wage Supervisor-1 or above). The investigator must be a
disinterested, impartial individual who has no interest or involvement in the
custodianship, care, accountability, or safekeeping of the property in
question.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.3.<b>&nbsp;Report of Survey Investigation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>At a minimum, the
investigating official will perform the following steps during an
investigation:</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.3.1.<i>&nbsp;</i>Develop
the facts in the case which will lead to the findings and recommendations. The
investigator must interview any persons with knowledge of the case if they are
in the immediate area. This includes the person who may have lost, damaged,
destroyed, or stolen the property.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.3.2. Obtain
written statements from persons interviewed and obtain sworn statements in
accordance with the&nbsp;<i>Manual for Courts-Martial,</i>&nbsp;Appendix 2,
Section 936. This section authorizes the investigator to swear witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.3.3. Ensure the
findings and the recommendations are supported by the testimony of persons
involved and that the testimony leads logically to the findings and
recommendations.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.3.4. Determine if
financial liability should be assessed based strictly on the facts and
circumstances of the case. If financial liability is recommended based on value
on the property involved and not the fact that financial liability generally is
limited not to exceed one month's pay or by statements made to the
investigating officer by the person involved and the assessment of financial
liability will cause personal hardship.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Reducing the
recommended assessment of financial liability is a command prerogative and not
within the purview of the investigating officer.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.4.<b>&nbsp;Liability:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.31.4.1. All Air Force
members and employees can be held liable for the loss, damage, or destruction
of Government property proximately caused by their negligence, willful
misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.4.2. Persons who
have lost, damaged, destroyed, or stolen Government property valued at $500 or
less may voluntarily pay for the property.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.5.<b>&nbsp;Processing the Report of
Survey:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.31.5.1.<i>&nbsp;</i>After
the investigation is complete, the investigating official allows the persons
involved to review the case and provide verbal or written information to refute
the findings and recommendations. In the process of refuting the findings of a
report of survey, an Airman may seek advice from the local area defense
counsel.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.5.2.
The report of survey is then processed to the appointing authority to assign
financial responsibility against the individual charged or relieve him or her
from responsibility. If financial responsibility is assessed, refer the report
of survey to the legal office for review.</span></p>

<p><span>13.31.5.3. At the time the report of survey is
submitted for acknowledgment by the individual charged, he or she is advised
the report of survey action may be appealed to the next level in the chain of
command above the person who assigned the financial liability assessment.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 13G Facility
Management</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.32. Installation Commander Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The installation
commander has overall responsibility and accountability for the operation of an
Air Force installation. The major command and installation commander, assisted
by the base civil engineer, are responsible for the following:</span></p>

<p><span>13.32.1. Develop,
operate, maintain, and control the use of Air Force facilities in compliance
with applicable Department of Defense and Air Force policies and procedures.</span></p>

<p><span>13.32.2.
Develop comprehensive asset management plans, identify facility lifecycle
requirements, implement applicable common levels of service, assess the impact
of asset condition on mission support through the use of key performance
indicators, and develop and execute real property construction, sustainment,
restoration, and modernization programs.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.33. Responsibilities of the Using
Organization:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.33.1.
Successful facility management relies heavily upon the using organization. The
using organization's unit commander will ensure requirements for real property
alterations, additions, or new construction are identified to the base civil
engineer or wing commander when required.</span></p>

<p><span>13.33.2. The unit
commander designates in writing an officer, E-5 and above, or civilian
equivalent, as primary and alternate facility managers for each facility
assigned to the organization. In multipurpose facilities, the major user should
be assigned as the primary facility manager. Other organizations using a
portion of a multipurpose facility are encouraged to appoint an alternate
facility manager for their respective area.</span></p>

<p><span>13.33.3.
Work that alters real property in any way, to include modifications or repair,
requires approval from the base civil engineer. Facility managers submit work
requests to the base civil engineer customer service unit utilizing established
processes. The base civil engineer determines the execution method for work
that is approved.</span></p>

<p><span>13.33.4. Emergency work,
defined as work that corrects an issue that poses an immediate threat to
mission, life, safety, or health will be identified to customer service unit by
the quickest means possible, to include verbal or phone communication. All
other forms of work will be identified to the customer service unit by the
facility manager utilizing the Air Force Form 332,&nbsp;<i>Base Civil Engineer
Work Request</i>, or designated information technology systems.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.34. Base Civil Engineer Squadron
Responsibilities:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.34.1. The base civil
engineer is charged to provide, operate, maintain, restore, and protect the
built and natural infrastructure necessary to support the Air Force mission. As
such, the base civil engineer serves as the focal point for all construction,
sustainment, restoration, and modernization of facilities identified as real
property and associated real property installed equipment.</span></p>

<p><span>13.34.2. The base civil
engineer's customer service unit typically manages the installation's facility
manager program. They provide initial and recurring training for facility
managers, which covers facility manager roles and responsibilities and
identifies the processes and procedures required for submitting work requests.</span></p>

<p><span>13.34.3. The base civil
engineer's customer service unit receives and reviews all incoming work
requests for validity, verifies scope, and ensures the work request is
coordinated with the appropriate agencies such as fire, safety, and
environmental. If the work request is approved, it will be executed in-house by
the operations flight or as a contract managed by the engineering flight.</span></p>

<p><span>13.34.4.
In-house work will either be direct scheduled or planned. Direct scheduled work
does not need detailed planning and can be sent directly to the required shop
for execution. An example of a direct scheduled work is fixing a leaky faucet.
Planned work is typically more complex and requires detailed planning,
scheduling of multiple shops, and lead time for material acquisition. An
example of planned work is relocating a doorway and associated exit signs to
accommodate the new layout. In-house work is prioritized for execution based on
impact to the overall mission and as labor, materials, and funding become
available.</span></p>

<p><span>13.34.5. When work
exceeds the scope or capability of the operations flight, the work request will
be classified as a project and sent to the base civil engineer's engineering
flight where it will compete against other projects for execution as a
contract.</span></p>

<p><span>13.34.6.
The base civil engineer ensures changes to real property are captured and
updated in the real property inventory. The real property inventory must be
complete and up-to-date with source documentation for audit purposes to support
financial improvement and audit readiness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.35. Planning and Programming Facility
Projects:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.35.1. Planning refers
to the identification of facility work to satisfy current and future mission
requirements. The base civil engineer uses several methods to identify facility
requirements including annual space utilization surveys, biennial commander s
facility assessments, environmental compliance status assessments, asset
management plans, and user- or occupant-identified requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>13.35.2. During
programming, the authority and resources necessary to accomplish the planned
work are acquired. After the requirements are identified, the base civil
engineer develops facility project proposals and presents them to the
installation commander for validation, prioritization, and approval by the
proper authority. A key element of programming facility requirements is proper
work classification. Work authorization, approval levels, and fund sources vary
with work classification. Real property maintenance work is classified as
maintenance, repair, or construction. Operations and maintenance
appropriation-funded unspecified minor military construction projects may not
exceed $1,000,000. The threshold for using operation and maintenance funding
for laboratory revitalization unspecified minor military construction projects
is $4,000,000.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.36. Real Property Records:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.36.1. Air Force
leadership, Department of Defense, and Congress utilize real property inventory
to make planning, programming, and budgeting decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>13.36.2.
The real property inventory forms an audit trail that begins when a facility is
constructed and includes all costs for any alterations and improvements
accomplished by military construction and minor construction, to include
self-help or government purchase card work. A complete real property inventory
consists of all sites, lands, and facilities for which the Air Force has real
property accountability, regardless of the organization using or funding the
facility or land.</span></p>

<p><span>13.36.3. Any activity
leading to real property inventory additions, updates, or deletions must have
proper approval documentation from the base civil engineer and filed with the
real property officer as directed. In most instances these actions are
accomplished by the civil engineer squadron. However, when services are
procured by government purchase card or other means the facility manager will
assist with accomplishing these actions.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 13H Energy
Conservation Program</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>13.37. Air Force Need for Program.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Federal government, as the Nation's largest energy consumer, must significantly
improve their energy management in order to save taxpayer dollars and reduce
emissions that contribute to air pollution and global climate change. In
encouraging effective energy management in the Federal government, the Energy
Policy Act of 2005, the Security Act of 2007, and Executive Order 13693&nbsp;<i>Planning
for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,</i>&nbsp;strive to achieve the
following goals:</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.1.&nbsp;<b>Energy Efficiency and
Greenhouse Gases Reduction Goal.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Improve
energy efficiency through reduction of facility energy intensity (British
thermal units per year per square foot) by 2.5 percent annually through the end
of fiscal year 2025, or a total of 25 percent by the end of fiscal year 2025,
relative to Air Force energy use in fiscal year 2015. Continue to reduce
facility energy intensity by 1.5 percent annually from fiscal year 2015 to
fiscal year 2020, or a total of 37.5 percent relative to Air Force energy use
in fiscal year 2003. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions 40% by fiscal year 2025,
relative to a 2008 baseline for most facilities.</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.2.&nbsp;<b>Sustainable Design and
Development:</b></span></p>

<p><span>13.37.2.1.
All new construction and major renovation of facilities must comply with Air
Force sustainable design and development policy, 2 June 2011, and incorporate
sustainable practices. These facilities must become net-zero energy facilities
(renewable generation offsets all fossil fuel) by 2030. Fifteen percent of
existing facility inventory must incorporate sustainable practices by the end
of fiscal year 2025.</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.2.2. Agency
acquisition of goods and services must incorporate the use of sustainable
environmental practices, including acquisition of bio based, environmentally
preferable, energy efficient, water efficient, and recycled content products.
This includes the use of paper with at least 30 percent recycled content.</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.3.&nbsp;<b>Vehicles.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Petroleum consumption is
to be reduced by 30 percent through the end of fiscal year 2025<b>&nbsp;</b>as
compared to fiscal year 2014. Alternative (nonpetroleum-based) fuel use is to
be increased by 10 percent annually. Zero emissions vehicles should account for
20 percent of all new agency passenger vehicle acquisitions by 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>13.37.4.&nbsp;<b>Renewable Energy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Energy Policy Act of
2005 established that in fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year 2009, 3 percent
of electrical consumption be generated by renewable sources; in fiscal year
2010 through fiscal year 2012, 5 percent and 7.5 percent thereafter. Executive
Order 13693 outlines the goal of 30 percent of facility electric consumption
come from renewable sources by 2025 and Title 10, United States Code, Section
2911,&nbsp;<i>Energy Performance Goals and Master Plan for the Department of
Defense,</i>&nbsp;sets a goal of 25 percent of electrical energy consumption generated
by renewable sources by fiscal year 2025.</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.5.&nbsp;<b>Petroleum.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Through
life-cycle cost-effective measures, each agency shall reduce the use of
petroleum within its facilities. Agencies may accomplish this reduction by
switching to a less greenhouse gas-intensive, nonpetroleum energy source, such
as synthetic or renewable energy sources.</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.6.&nbsp;<b>Electronic Products.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Electronic products
procured must be at least 95 percent compliant with electronic product
environmental assessment tool standards. Energy Star features of computers must
be enabled. Use environmentally sound practices when disposing of electronic
equipment.</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.7.&nbsp;<b>Source Energy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Federal government
shall strive to reduce total energy use and associated greenhouse gas and other
air emissions, as measured at the source.</span></p>

<p><span>13.37.8.&nbsp;<b>Water Conservation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Beginning
in fiscal year 2008, reduce potable water consumption intensity (gallons per
square foot) relative to fiscal year 2007, through life-cycle cost-effective
measures by 2 percent annually through the end of fiscal year 2025, or 36
percent by the end of calendar year 2025. Reduce industrial, landscaping, and
agricultural water consumption by 2 percent annually or 30 percent by the end
of fiscal year 2025 relative to a baseline of consumption in fiscal year 2010.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.38. Air Force Compliance with Policy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Compliance with energy
management policy is assessed by taking measurements in two areas: mobility
energy and facility (utility) energy. (<b>Note</b>: Water usage is included in
the definition of energy management.)</span></p>

<p><span>13.38.1.&nbsp;<b>Mobility Energy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The policy to reduce
mobility energy will be assessed by measuring actual petroleum consumption.
Consumption will be measured in barrels and include aircraft and vehicle
operations.</span></p>

<p><span>13.38.2.&nbsp;<b>Facility Energy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The policy to reduce
facility energy will be assessed by measuring utility consumption to include
electricity, coal, natural gas, petroleum, water, etc. Consumption will be
measured in million British thermal units per square foot (or gallons per square
foot) and will include all installation facilities except privatized housing
and facilities meeting Department of Energy exclusion requirements.</span></p>

<p><b><span>13.39. Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>13.39.1. With the constant emphasis on
efficiency, the Air Force must get the greatest return from every investment.
The Air Force invests in people and other resources, all of which must be
managed wisely. This chapter provided an overview of responsibilities and
outlined a few of the many Air Force management objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>13.39.2.
All supervisors, managers, and commanders are responsible for safeguarding Air
Force resources and exercising sound resource management practices. Remember,
the amount of money spent and the other resources used (manpower, facilities)
affect the entire mission. Leaders have a daily role to play in the overall
system. They must plan for future requirements and ensure allocated resources
are used properly. If correctly accomplished, the result will be a stronger and
more efficient Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 14A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.1. Introduction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>14.1.1.
Your success as a military leader depends on your ability to think critically
and creatively; it is also crucial to communicate your intentions and decisions
to others. The ability to communicate clearly to write, speak, and actively
listen greatly impacts your capacity to inform, teach, motivate, mentor, and
lead those around you. Communicating your intent and ideas so that others
understand your message and act on it is one of the primary qualities of
leadership.</span></p>

<p><span>14.1.2. Communication is
the process of sharing ideas, information, and messages with others. In the Air
Force, most communication involves speaking and writing. Any communication can
be broken into three parts: the sender, the message, and the audience. For
communication to be successful, the audience must not only receive the message,
but the audience must interpret the message in the way the sender intended.</span></p>

<p><span>14.1.3.
This chapter begins by examining the fundamentals of better communication, both
written and spoken. Then the chapter focuses on written communications in
general terms and outlines certain methods that can be used to improve writing
style. Finally, it provides an overview and samples of the types of correspondence
the noncommissioned officer (NCO) is likely to deal with in daily activities.

<p><b><i><span>Section 14B The
Principles and Seven Steps for Effective Communication</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.2. Principles of Effective Communication.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Everyone must understand what makes communication succeed and
fail. Most mistakes are caused by forgetting one of the five principles of good
communication. This section addresses the five core principles, focused,
organized, clear, understanding, and supported (FOCUS) (Figure 14.1).</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Figure 14.1. FOCUS
Principles</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>14.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Focused.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The first hallmark of
good communication is that the communication is focused. The sender has a clear
idea of the purpose and objective, locks on target, and stays on track.</span></p>

<p><span>14.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Organized.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Good organization means
your material is presented in a logical, systematic manner. When writing or
speaking is not well organized, audiences become easily confused or impatient
and may stop reading or listening. Even if you are providing useful, relevant
information, your audience may underestimate the value of the information and
your credibility.</span></p>

<p><span>14.2.3.<b>&nbsp;Clear.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This principle covers
two interrelated ideas. First, to communicate clearly, we need to understand
the rules of language; how to spell and pronounce words, and how to assemble
and punctuate sentences. Second, we should get to the point, not hide our ideas
in a maze of words.</span></p>

<p><span>14.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Understanding.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Understanding their
current knowledge, views, and level of interest in the topic helps when sharing
ideas with others. Understanding what is&nbsp;expected with the format and
length of response, due date, level of formality, and any staffing requirements
helps when you have been asked to write a report.</span></p>

<p><span>14.2.5.<b>&nbsp;Supported.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Use logic and support to
make your point. Support and logic are the tools used to build credibility and
trust with your audience. Nothing cripples a clearly written, properly
punctuated paper quicker than a fractured fact or a distorted argument.</span></p>



<p><b><span>14.3. Overview.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Like
many things, good communication requires preparation. There are seven steps
that will help every Airman become a better communicator, both in written
correspondence and in speaking abilities (Figure 14.2). The first four steps
lay the groundwork for the drafting process.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b><span>14.4. Step 1<i> </i>Analyze Purpose and
Audience.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Once the need for
communication is determined, step 1 requires you to be&nbsp;clear on your
purpose and know or understand your audience. Those who&nbsp; have mastered the
art of communication stay focused on their objective&nbsp;and approach audience
analysis seriously</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>14.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Choose the Purpose.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Most Air Force writing
or speaking is either to direct, inform,&nbsp;persuade, or inspire. Your task
is to think about the message you<b>&nbsp;</b>want to send (the what) and make
some sort of determination what your purpose is (the why). Once you decide the
purpose, you will know where to place the emphasis and what the tone of your
communication should be (Figure 14.3).</span></p>

  <td width="474" valign="top">
  <p><b><span>To Direct </span></b><i><span>Directive
  communication</span></i><span>&nbsp;is generally
  used to pass on information describing actions you expect to be carried out

  directions and expectations of your audience.</span></p>
  <p><b><span>To Inform </span></b><span>The
  goal of&nbsp;<i>informative communication</i>&nbsp;is to pass on information
  to the audience. The emphasis in informative communication is clear, direct
  communication with accurate and adequate information tailored to the
  education and skill levels of the audience. Audience feedback and interaction
  may be appropriate in some situations to make sure they  got the message. </span></p>
  <p><b><span>To Persuade </span></b><i><span>Persuasive Communication</span></i><span>&nbsp;is typically used when you are trying to  sell  your

  <p><b><span>To Inspire </span></b><span>One
  final purpose for writing or speaking that doesn t get much attention, but is
  frequently used in the military is to&nbsp;<i>inspire</i>. The emphasis in

  and likewise your audience.</span></p>

Purpose</span></b></p>

<p><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p><span>14.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Draft the Purpose Statement.</b></span></p>

<p><span>One way to make sure you
are clear on your objective is to write a&nbsp;<i>purpose statement</i>, which
is one sentence that captures the essence of what you are trying to do your
 bottom line.  Developing a clear purpose statement will:</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.2.1. Help you FOCUS
as you develop your communication.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.2.2. Help your
audience&nbsp;<i>focus</i>&nbsp;when you deliver your message.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.3.<b>&nbsp;Know Yourself.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Realizing your own
strengths and weaknesses will help you meet your communication goals.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.4.<b>&nbsp;Know Your Organization.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In the military, we
rarely act or speak in a vacuum. Often we represent our organization, unit, or
functional area and must understand them and accommodate their views,
capabilities, or concerns in our communications.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.5.<b>&nbsp;Know Your Audience.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The receiving audience
falls into one of four sub-categories. Depending on the type of communication
and coordination needed, you may or may not deal with each one of these:</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.5.1. Primary
receiver the person you directly communicate with, either verbally or in
writing.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.5.2. Secondary
receiver people you indirectly communicate with through the primary receivers.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.5.3.
Key decision makers the most powerful members of the audience; the ones that
really make the decisions. Knowing who they are will help focus your attention
and potentially your delivery in larger briefings and certain written
communication.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.5.4.
Gatekeepers people in the chain who typically review the communication before
the communication reaches the intended audience. Knowing who they are and what
their expectations are can save you embarrassment and help ensure your success
in the long run.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.<b>&nbsp;Succeed With Your Audience.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Some tips are:</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Rank.</b>&nbsp;Differences
in military rank can be a real barrier to communication in the Air Force. Many
of us become tongue-tied when communicating with those senior in rank, and
cursory or impatient with those who are junior in rank. We must constantly
remind ourselves we are all communicative equals and should strive to be candid,
direct, and respectful with everyone.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Jargon.</b>&nbsp;Tailor
to your audience<b>.&nbsp;</b>Do not overestimate the knowledge and expertise
of your readers, but do not talk down to them either. Be careful with excessive
use of career-field specific jargon and acronyms.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Be
Inclusive.</b>&nbsp;Remember our diverse force<b>.</b>&nbsp;Sometimes we
inadvertently exclude members of our audience by falling into communication
traps involving references to race, religion, ethnicity, or sex. Remember this
concept when designing your visual support. Knowing your audience and adhering
to good taste and sensitivity will keep you in check.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.4.&nbsp;<b>Tone.</b>&nbsp;This
is not just what you say, but how you say it<b>.&nbsp;</b>Closely tied to the
purpose of your communication is the tone you take with your audience. Speakers
have gestures, voice, and movements to help them communicate. Writers only have
words on paper. How many times have you seen colleagues get bent out of shape
over a misunderstood e-mail? Why? Because the nonverbal signals available
during face-to-face communication are absent. Recognize this disadvantage in
written communication and pay close attention to the tone.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.5.&nbsp;<b>Courtesy.</b>&nbsp;The
first rule of writing is to be polite. Forego anger, criticism, and
sarcasm strive to be reasonable and persuasive. Try not to deliberately
embarrass someone and avoid with a more tactful choice of words.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.6.&nbsp;<b>Make
it Personal.</b>&nbsp;When appropriate, use pronouns to create instant rapport,
show concern, and keep your reader involved. Using pronouns also keeps your
writing from being monotonous, dry, and abstract. The pronouns you will
probably use the most are you, yours, we, us, and our. Use I, me, and my
sparingly. One rule of business writing is to put your audience first; so, when
possible, avoid using I<i>&nbsp;</i>as the first word of an opening sentence
and avoid starting two sentences in a row with we or I unless you are trying to
hammer home a point.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.7.&nbsp;<b>Formal.&nbsp;</b>( To
be, or not to be ) versus Informal ( hey dude ). Different communication
situations require different levels of formality. The informal tone is more
like a conversation between you and your reader and is characterized by clear,
direct, active language. In today's Air Force, most of your writing will be
informal, though ceremonies and awards may require more elaborate (formal)
language. Whether your tone is formal or informal, you still need to follow the
accepted rules of grammar.</span></p>

<p><span>14.4.6.8.&nbsp;<b>Be
Positive.&nbsp;</b>To cultivate a positive tone give praise where praise is
due, acknowledge acceptance before&nbsp;focusing on
additional improvements, and express criticism in the form of helpful
questions, suggestions, requests, recommendations, or clear directives rather
than accusations. Your audience always appreciates sincerity and honesty.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.5. Step 2<i> </i>Research Your Topic.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Whether
your goal is to persuade or inform, you will need more than fancy words to win
the day you will need substance as well as style. Once you re clear on your
purpose and audience (Step 1), you will need to research your topic to uncover
information that will support your communication goals. Before you begin the
research, refer to the five approaches to researching below for the best method
for accomplishing researching.</span></p>

<p><span>14.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Approach
1</b>. Review purpose and scope of the overall project. Sometimes your purpose
and scope will evolve as you learn more about the topic, and you may need to do
some preliminary research just to get smart enough to scope out the effort.</span></p>

<p><span>14.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Approach
2.&nbsp;</b>Assign a deadline as you can easily get lost in the research
process. Don t do an outstanding job of data retrieval, then a marginal job on
the presentation because you ran out of time.</span></p>

<p><span>14.5.3.&nbsp;<b>Approach
3.&nbsp;</b>Ask the boss. Even if you can eventually find the answer on your
own, save some time by asking your supervisor for suggestions on where to
start.</span></p>

<p><span>14.5.4.&nbsp;<b>Approach
4.&nbsp;</b>Determine what is known. Before you look for answers outside
yourself, look in the mirror. You may already have valuable knowledge about an
assigned research project. When relying on personal knowledge, be sure to
identify and guard against any biases you may have.</span></p>

<p><span>14.5.5.&nbsp;<b>Approach
5.&nbsp;</b>Determine where to look for information. Coworkers and base
personnel are easy because you can meet with them face-to-face. Office files
and references in paper form and on your computer network may be valuable
sources of information. Finally, the internet and library offer an unlimited
supply of information.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.6. Step 3<i> </i>Support Your Ideas.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Once
you have researched your topic and collected information, you need to figure
out how to use what you have found to meet your communication goals. Individual
pieces of evidence are used to build your argument. When identifying some
common types of evidence, they may include:</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Definition.</b>&nbsp;A
definition<b>&nbsp;</b>is a precise meaning or significance of a word or
phrase.</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Testimony.</b>&nbsp;A
testimony<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>uses the comments of recognized authorities to
support your claim. These comments are sometimes direct quotations or
paraphrases, but direct quotations tend to carry more weight with listeners or
readers.</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Statistics.&nbsp;</b>The
use of statistics<b>&nbsp;</b>provides a summary of data that allows your
audience to better interpret quantitative information. Statistics can be very
persuasive and provide excellent support if handled competently. Keep them
simple and easy to read and understand. Also, remember to round off your
statistics whenever possible and document the exact source of your statistics.</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.4.&nbsp;<b>Example</b>.
An example<i>&nbsp;</i>is a specific instance chosen to represent a larger fact
in order to clarify an abstract idea or support a claim. Good examples must be
appropriate, brief and attention arresting. Quite often they are presented in
groups of two or three for impact.</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.5.&nbsp;<b>Fact.</b>&nbsp;A
fact is a noncontroversial piece of data that can be confirmed by observation
or by talking to communally accepted authorities. Be careful to distinguish
facts from inferences, and handle inferences you would like to use in your
research as testimony, not fact.</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.6.&nbsp;<b>Explanation:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.6.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Analysis.</b>&nbsp;The
analysis is the separation of a whole into smaller pieces for further studies;
clarifying a complex issue by examining one piece at a time.</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Comparison
and Contrast.</b>&nbsp;Use comparison to dramatize similarities between two
objects or situations, and contrast to emphasize differences.</span></p>

<p><span>14.6.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Description.</b>&nbsp;A
description is to tell about something in detail, to paint a picture with
words, typically more personal and subjective than a definition.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.7.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Step 4<i> </i>Organize and Outline.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Select
a pattern that enables you and your readers to move systematically and
logically through your ideas from beginning to conclusion. Some of the most
common organizational patterns are listed below. Your purpose, the needs of
your audience, and the nature of your material will influence your choice of
pattern.</span></p>

<p><span>14.7.1.<b>&nbsp;Topical.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Use the topical format
to present groups of ideas, objects, or events by categories.</span></p>

<p><span>14.7.2.<b>&nbsp;Compare or Contrast.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Use the compare and
contrast style when you need to discuss similarities and differences between topics,
concepts, or ideas.</span></p>

<p><span>14.7.3.<b>&nbsp;Chronological.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When using the
chronological pattern, you discuss events, problems, or processes in the
sequence of time in which occurrences take place or should take place (past to
present or present to future).</span></p>

<p><span>14.7.4.<b>&nbsp;Sequential.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A step-by-step approach,
sequential is similar to the chronological pattern. Use this approach to
describe a sequence of steps necessary to complete a technical procedure or
process.</span></p>

<p><span>14.7.5.<b>&nbsp;Spatial or Geographical.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When
using spatial or geographical pattern, you will start at some point in space
and proceed in sequence to other points. This pattern is based on a directional
strategy north to south, east to west, clockwise or counterclockwise, bottom to
top, above and below.</span></p>



<p><span>14.7.6.<b>&nbsp;Problem and Solution.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Use
the problem and solution pattern to identify and describe a problem and one or
more possible solutions, or an issue and possible techniques for resolving the
issue. Discuss all facets of the problem, such as origin, characteristics, and
impact.</span></p>

<p><span>14.7.7.<b>&nbsp;Reasoning and Logic.</b></span></p>

<p><span>State an opinion and
then make your case by providing support for your position. Use the reasoning
and logic pattern when your mission is to present research that will lead your
audience down the path to your point of view.</span></p>

<p><span>14.7.8.<b>&nbsp;Cause and Effect.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Use the cause and effect
pattern to show how one or more ideas, actions, or conditions lead to other
ideas, actions, or conditions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.8. Step 5<i> </i>Draft.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A draft is not the
finished product, and each sentence does not have to be polished and perfect.
The focus is to get your ideas down on paper. Do not obsess about grammar,
punctuation, spelling, and word choice this all comes later. You do not have to
fix every mistake you see. By periodically checking your outline, you are less
likely to lose focus and include irrelevant information. Break up your draft
into a three-part structure introduction, body, and conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.1.<b>&nbsp;Introduction.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
introduction captures your audience's attention, establishes rapport, and
announces your purpose. Therefore, the introduction sets the stage and tone for
your message and the direction you plan to take the audience. A typical
introduction has three components: stage-setting remarks, a purpose statement,
and an overview.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.1.1. Stage-setting
remarks sets the tone, captures the audience's attentions, and encourages the
audience to read further. Stage-setting remarks are optional and can be omitted
in very short messages.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.1.2. The purpose
statement is the one sentence you would keep if you had only one. Moreover, the
purpose statement specifically states your purpose, thesis, or main point.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.1.3. The overview
clearly presents your main points, previews your paragraph sequence, and ties
your main points to your purpose.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.2.<b>&nbsp;Body.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This
is the heart of your message and includes the main ideas about your subject and
supporting details under each main idea. The body, depending on the purpose and
subject, will typically consist of several paragraphs. As a general rule a
separate paragraph is formed for each main idea.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.3.<b>&nbsp;Conclusion.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
conclusion is the last and often neglected part of well-arranged communication.
An effective conclusion often summarizes the main points discussed in the body,
and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. Conclude your communication with
positive statements based on your preceding discussion and avoid bringing up
new information. The introduction and conclusion should balance each other
without being identical.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.4.<b>&nbsp;Effective Paragraphs:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.8.4.1.
Paragraphs are the primary vehicles for developing ideas. They group related
ideas into single units of thought, separate one unit of thought from another,
and alert readers that the writer is shifting to another phase of the subject.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.4.2.
Each paragraph contains a topic sentence, preferably at the beginning, that
prepares the reader for the rest of the paragraph and provides a point of focus
for support details, facts, figures, and examples. Use supporting ideas to
prove, clarify, illustrate, and develop your main point. The objective is to
help the readers see the paragraphs as integrated units rather than a mere
collection of sentences.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.5.<b>&nbsp;Plain Language.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Prepare
all Air Force correspondence using plain language. Plain language means using
logical organization; common, everyday words (except for necessary technical
terms);  you  and other pronouns; the active voice; and short sentences.</span></p>



<p><span>14.8.6.<b>&nbsp;Transitions.</b></span></p>

<p><span>One
way to make sure your paragraphs flow together, both internally and externally,
is by using transitions in the form of words, phrases, or sentences. Internal
transitions are used within a sentence to improve the flow, while external
transitions are used to link separate paragraphs together within the body of
the communication.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.7.<b>&nbsp;Effective Sentences.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To draft clear and
concise sentences, choose clear and concise words and phrases to make up your
sentences. There are three considerations to make when drafting sentences:
active voice, smothered verbs, and parallelism.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.7.1.&nbsp;<b>Write
Actively.</b>&nbsp;The active voice shows the subject as the actor, reaches out
to the reader and gets to the point quickly with fewer words. Whereas the
passive voice shows the subject as receiver of the action.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.7.2.<b>&nbsp;Smothered
Verbs.</b>&nbsp;Make your verbs do the work for you. Weak writing relies on
general verbs that take extra words to complete their meaning. Keep verbs
active, lively, specific, concise and out in front, not hidden.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.7.3.<b>&nbsp;Parallel
Construction.</b>&nbsp;Use a consistent pattern when making a list. If your
sentence contains a series of items separated by commas, keep the grammatical

<p><span>If
you occasionally suffer from writer's block, you are not alone many experienced
writers have a hard time getting started. The five fears that lead to writer s
block are fear of failure, fear of rejection, fear of success, fear of
offending, and fear of running out of ideas. Some ways to overcome writer s
block are:</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.8.1. Brainstorm or
 free write  to get your creative ideas flowing.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.8.2. Write just the
topic sentences for each paragraph.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.8.3. Avoid
procrastination.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.8.4. Don t worry
about page length, word count, or some other constraint on the first draft.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.8.5. Bounce ideas
off a friend or coworker.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.8.6. Use visuals,
like pictures or diagrams, to show meaning.</span></p>

<p><span>14.8.8.7. Develop
rituals or routines to get in the mood for writing.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.9. Step 6<i> </i>Edit the Draft.</span></b></p>

<p><span>One
way to make sure you edit efficiently is to read your document at least three
times to allow yourself to really look hard at the problem areas that could
mess up your product. In the first pass, look at the big picture; in the second
pass, look at paragraph construction; and in the third pass look at sentences,
phrases, and words.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.1.<b>&nbsp;First Pass: The Big Picture.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Pay attention to the
arrangement and flow of ideas. Here are some ideas to think about:</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.1.1. Ensure the
purpose statement answers the original tasker.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.1.2. Review the
introduction to ensure it contains the purpose statement.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.1.3. Compare the
introduction and conclusion to make sure they go together without sounding
identical. The introduction should declare the purpose, and the conclusion
should show the readers the purpose was accomplished.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.1.4. When checking
for relevance and completeness, ensure the paragraphs clearly relate to the
purpose statement, contain all main points, and are arranged in a consistent
order.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Second Pass: Paragraph,
Structure, and Clarity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In the second pass,
check whether the main points and supporting ideas are appropriately organized
in paragraphs. For each paragraph, focus on the following areas:</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Unity
of Focus.</b>&nbsp;Ensure there is only one main point of the paragraph and all
the information in the paragraph relates enough to be in the same paragraph.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Topic
Sentence.</b>&nbsp;Ensure the paragraph has one sentence that captures the
central idea of the paragraph.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Supporting
Ideas.</b>&nbsp;Ensure sentences expand, clarify, illustrate, and explain
points mentioned or suggested in each main idea. The paragraph should have
enough details to support the central idea without any extra sentences that are
irrelevant to the main point. Also, ensure all transitional words, phrases, and
clauses improve the flow and show proper relationships. Finally, the paragraph
should contain three to seven sentences.</span></p>

<p><span>14.9.3.<b>&nbsp;Third Pass: Sentences, Phrases,
and Words.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Look
at the details and concentrate on the small stuff that can sabotage your
communication. These details include the passive voice, unclear language,
excessive wordiness, grammatical errors, and spelling mistakes. Read the paper
out loud. This requires the communicator to slow down and use two senses seeing
and hearing which increases the chances of catching errors. What one sense
misses, the other will pick up.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.10. Step 7<i> </i>Fight for Feedback and Get
Approval.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Fighting
for feedback and getting approval are both activities that are part of life in
the Air Force. Feedback and coordination are closely linked. If the
communicator does a good job at fighting for feedback, the coordination process
becomes much smoother. The biggest benefit to fighting for feedback is getting
a second pair of eyes to review the communication. Even the best writers and
speakers cannot see where the communication can be made stronger as they become
too close to the communication. Coworkers are usually a good choice because of
their familiarity with the issue and jargon. Also, asking a trusted agent or
someone you consider an expert in a specific area of the communication, such as
grammar, is another choice to obtain feedback.</span></p>

<p><span>14.10.1.<b>&nbsp;Feedback.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To give effective
feedback, refer to the following:</span></p>

<p><span>14.10.1.1. First,
effective feedback is consistent, objective, and sensitive to the stated
purpose. If asked to review a package, make sure you understand what the person
wants from your review and stick to it.</span></p>

<p><span>14.10.1.2. Second,
distinguish between necessary, desirable, and unnecessary changes. A page full
of red marks is hard to interpret. Instead, give the author a sense of what
really needs to be changed.</span></p>

<p><span>14.10.1.3.
Third, avoid using general statements. Instead, pinpoint specific problems such
as awkward sentences, grammar, etc. 14.10.1.4. Fourth, concentrate on improving
the message's content, not the style or personal preferences of the author
(unless the author has asked you specifically to comment on writing style).
Before providing feedback, refer to the feedback philosophies in Figure
14.4.&nbsp;<b>Figure 14.4. Feedback Philosophies</b></span></p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="0">
 <tbody><tr>
  <td width="577" valign="top">
  <p><b><span>Feedback:&nbsp;</span></b><span>Should describe rather than judge.</span></p>
  <p><span>Is both positive and negative. A balanced description of other
  people's work considers both strong and weak points.</span></p>
  <p><span>Strive for being specific rather than general. Highlight or
  underline specific items you want to bring to the author's attention.</span></p>
  <p><span>Direct at behavior the author can control. A
  suggestion to improve the briefing room's temperature, for example, is
  probably beyond the author's control.</span></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><span>14.10.2.<b>&nbsp;Supervisor-Subordinate
Feedback.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Responsibility
as a supervisor requires the need to be tactful and patient, especially when
approving and disapproving subordinate's communications. A supervisor is
obligated to help subordinates improve their work. This obligation may mean
helping them to revise or rewrite their communication, especially if they are
inexperienced.</span></p>

<p><span>14.10.3.&nbsp;<b>Get Approval.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Formal coordination gives affected individuals a
chance to comment, and helps ensure the best course of action
is&nbsp;presented to the decision maker. To do this you
get other offices to approve what you are proposing through the coordination
process. Only after the package is fully coordinated can you provide the boss
with the best course of action and tell them who is supporting that action.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 14C Writing</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.11. Common Writing Formats.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The principles of
effective communication apply equally well to written and spoken
communications. This section will not repeat these principles but will provide
the basic formats of written Air Force communication. These formats are the
most common and familiar ways of preparing all official and personal
correspondence and memorandums.</span></p>

<p><span>14.11.1.<b>&nbsp;Official Memorandum.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Official
memorandums are used to communicate with all Department of Defense agencies. In
addition, use official memorandums to conduct official business outside the
government with vendors or contractors when the personal letter is
inappropriate (Figure 14.5).</span></p>

<p><span>14.11.1.1. Use printed
letterhead, computer-generated letterhead, or plain bond paper. Only type or
print on one side of the paper using black or blue-black ink, and use 10 to
12-point Times New Roman font for text.</span></p>

<p><span>14.11.1.2.
Neatly and legibly correct minor typographical errors in ink on all
correspondence do not redo correspondence to correct a typographical error that
does not change intent. Redo correspondence to correct a minor error only if
the correction is sufficiently important to justify the time, purpose, and
expense.</span></p>

<p><span>14.11.2.<b>&nbsp;Personal Letter.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Use
the personal letter when your communication needs a personal touch or when
warmth or sincerity is essential. You may use the personal letter to write to
an individual on a private matter for praise, condolence, sponsorship, etc.
Keep the personal letter brief, preferably no longer than one page, include a
salutation element (Dear Xxxx), and a complimentary close element (usually
Sincerely).</span></p>

<p><span>14.11.3.<b>&nbsp;Memorandum for Record (MFR or
MR).</b></span></p>

<p><span>The MFR has three forms:
the separate-page MFR, the explanatory note, and the compact note.</span></p>

<p><span>14.11.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Separate-Page Memorandum for Record.</b>&nbsp;The
separate-page MFR is based on the official memorandum but omits the  FROM: 
since the writer is both the sender and receiver. This MFR is an in-house
document to record information that would otherwise not be recorded in writing
(for example, a telephone call, results of a meeting, or information passed to
other staff members on an informal basis). People who work together every day
generally pass most information to their coworkers verbally, but there are
times when information should be recorded and kept on file. A memorandum for
record is the right tool for this purpose. Figure 14.6 illustrates the format
for the separate page MFR.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="566" height="256" src="afh1_files/image239.png" ></span></p>



<p><span>14.11.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Explanatory
Note Memorandum for Record.</b>&nbsp;The explanatory note memorandum for record
is usually on the file copy of most correspondence (Figures 14.7 and 14.8).
This memorandum for record gives the reader a quick synopsis of the purpose of
the correspondence, tells who got involved, and provides additional information
not included in the basic correspondence. By reading both the basic
correspondence and the memorandum for record, readers should understand enough
about the subject to coordinate on or sign the correspondence without having to
call or ask for more information. If the basic correspondence really does say
everything, an explanatory memorandum for record may not be required. However,
some organizations require you to acknowledge that you have not merely
forgotten the memorandum for record by including  memorandum for record:
Self-explanatory  on the file copy.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.12. Writing Accomplishment Impact Bullet
Statements.</span></b></p>

<p><span>At
some point in your career, you may be required to write bullet statements for
an enlisted performance report; Air Force IMT 1206,&nbsp;<i>Nomination for
Award;</i></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>bullet background paper;
or other Air Force communication. The key to writing an effective bullet
statement consists of three steps:</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.1.<b>&nbsp;Step 1: Extract the Facts.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Getting
started can be the hardest part of bullet statement writing. The key is to
collect all of the information you can find relevant to the actual
accomplishment. First, gather as much information as you can, then sort through
the information collected. When sorting the information:</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.1.1. Isolate and
record the specific action the person performed.</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.1.2. Mark the
action with a power verb that best describes the action (for example, repaired,
installed, designed, etc.).</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.1.3. Document
related numerical information (number of items fixed, dollars saved, man-hours
expended, people served, pages written, etc.).</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.1.4. Document how
this accomplishment impacted the bigger picture and broader mission of the
unit, group, wing, installation, command or Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.1.5. Once
captured, review each item and test to see if the item is truly associated with
the single accomplishment identified earlier.</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.2.&nbsp;<b>Step 2: Build the Structure.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The next step is to take
the sorted information and organize the information into an
accomplishment-impact bullet. There are two components: the accomplishment
element and the impact element.</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Accomplishment
Element.</b>&nbsp;The accomplishment element should always begin with an action
and only focus on one single accomplishment. Most of the time this action takes
the form of a strong action verb such as conducted, established, or led. If you
need to give action verbs an added boost, you can use an adverb such as
actively, energetically, or swiftly to modify the verb. For a more complete
list of verbs and adverbs, refer to Air Force Handbook 33-337,&nbsp;<i>The
Tongue and Quill</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Impact
Element.</b>&nbsp;The impact element part of the bullet statement explains how
the person's actions have had an effect on the organization. The impact element
can show varying levels of influence, such as the person's actions connected to
significant improvements to a work center's mission, a unit's mission, or as
broad as the entire Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>14.12.3.<b>&nbsp;Step 3: Streamline the Final
Product.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Streamlining the final

<p><b><i><span>Section
14D Face-to-Face: Speaking and Listening</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.13. Air Force Speaking.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This section focuses on
spoken communication both speaking and listening.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.1.<b>&nbsp;Verbal Communication.</b></span></p>

<p><span>An effective voice
drives home ideas or information. The speaker has control over such things as
rate, volume, pitch, and pause. The techniques used to create interest and help
increase communication include:</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Rate.</b>&nbsp;There
is no correct rate of speed for every speech; however, consider this: the
average processing rate is 500 words per minute and the average speaking rate
is 180 words a minute. Speak too slowly, and the audience will lose interest;
on the other hand, speak too fast and the speech will become unintelligible.
The key is to vary the rate of speech to hold the audience's attention and to
add emphasis.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Volume.</b>&nbsp;Another
verbal technique that can give emphasis to a speech is volume. If possible,
check out the room to know how loudly you must talk, remembering you will need
to talk louder with a crowd since the sound is absorbed. Remember your voice
will carry further when the room is empty versus full. If the audience must
strain to hear you, they will eventually tune you out from utter exhaustion.
Speak louder or softer to emphasize a point  a softer level or lower volume is
often the more effective way to achieve emphasis.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Pitch.</b>&nbsp;The
use of notes, higher or lower, in the voice is called pitch. Speakers use pitch
changes in vowels, words, or entire sentences. Use a downward (high to low)
inflection in a sentence for an air of certainty, and an upward (low to high)
inflection for an air of uncertainty. Variety in speech pitch helps to avoid
monotone and to capture the listener's attention.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.1.4.<b>&nbsp;Pause.</b>&nbsp;The
pause technique gives the speaker time to catch his or her breath and the
audience time to collect the speaker's ideas. The pause technique serves the
same function as punctuation in writing. Short pauses usually divide points
within a sentence and longer pauses note the ends of sentences. The speaker can
also use longer pauses for breaks from one main point to another, from the body
to the conclusion of the speech, or to set off an important point worthy of
short reflection.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.1.5.<b>&nbsp;Articulation
and Pronunciation.</b>&nbsp;Articulation is the art of expressing words
distinctly. Pronunciation is the ability to say words correctly. People can
articulate their thoughts and still mispronounce words while doing so.
Unfortunately (and unfairly), many people consider word pronunciation or
mispronunciation a direct reflection on the speaker's intelligence. If you are
not sure of the pronunciation, consult a current dictionary.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.1.6.<b>&nbsp;Length.</b>&nbsp;The
length of a presentation is crucial. A key rule in verbal communication is
short and sweet.</span></p>

<p><span>Be prepared, know what
you want to say, then say what you want to say with your purpose and audience
in mind.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.2.<b>&nbsp;Nonverbal Communication.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Actually
presenting the talk is the hardest part for many people. How can body movement,
voice, and sincerity enhance a presentation? Communications experts tell us
that over half of our meaning may be communicated nonverbally. Although
nonverbal meaning is communicated through vocal cues, much meaning is carried
by the physical behaviors of eye contact, body movement, and gestures.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Eye
Contact.</b>&nbsp;This is one of the most important factors in nonverbal
communication. Nothing will enhance the delivery more than effective eye
contact with the audience. Eye contact is important for three reasons. First,
lets the listeners know the speaker is interested in them. Second, effective
eye contact allows you to receive nonverbal feedback from the audience. Third,
effective eye contact enhances the credibility of the speaker.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Body
Movement.</b>&nbsp;Good body movement is important because body movement
catches the eye of the listener. Effective body movement can be described as
free and purposeful. While not essential, the speaker should feel free to move
around in front of the audience. When looking at note cards, speakers should
drop their eyes, not their head.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.2.3.<b>&nbsp;Gestures.</b>&nbsp;Gestures
are the purposeful use of the hands, arms, shoulders, and head to reinforce
what is being said. Effective gestures are both natural and purposeful.
Fidgeting with a paperclip, rearranging or shuffling papers, and constantly
clicking a pen are distracting to the audience.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.3.<b>&nbsp;Delivery Formats.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Your approach to
delivery of the spoken message is usually affected by several factors,
including the time you have to prepare and the nature of the message. Three
common delivery formats are:</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Impromptu.</b>&nbsp;Speaking
when we respond during a meeting or  take the floor  at a conference. Speakers
may do this when they have to speak publicly without warning or with only a few
moments' notice. To do impromptu speaking well requires a great amount of
self-confidence, mastery of the subject, and the ability to  think on your
feet.  A superb impromptu speaker has achieved the highest level in verbal
communications.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Prepared
(Formally Extemporaneous).</b>&nbsp;Prepared speaking or briefing refers to
those times when we have ample opportunity to prepare. This does not mean the
person writes a script and memorizes the script, but prepared delivery does
require a thorough outline with careful planning and practicing. The specific
words and phrases used at the time of delivery, however, are spontaneous and
sound very natural.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.3.3.<b>&nbsp;Manuscript.</b>&nbsp;A
manuscript briefing is the delivery format that requires every word spoken to
be absolutely perfect. The disadvantage of a manuscript briefing is that people
demonstrate a tendency to lack spontaneity, lack eye contact, and they stand
behind the lectern with their script.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.4.<b>&nbsp;Types of Speaking.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Types of speaking used
in the Air Force include briefing, teaching lecture, and formal speech.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Briefing.</b>&nbsp;The
best military briefings are concise and factual. Their major purpose is to
inform listeners about a mission, operation, or concept. Some briefings direct
or enable listeners to perform a procedure or carry out instructions. Other
briefings advocate, persuade, or support a certain solution and lead the audience
to accept the briefing. Every good briefing has the qualities of accuracy,
brevity, and clarity. Accuracy and clarity characterize all good speaking, but
brevity distinguishes the briefing from other types of speaking. A briefer must
be brief and to the point and should anticipate some of the questions that may
arise. If a briefer cannot answer a question, he or she should not attempt an
off-the-top-of-the-head answer. Instead, he or she should admit to not knowing
the answer and offer to provide the answer later.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Teaching
Lecture.</b>&nbsp;The teaching lecture is the method of instruction most often
used in the Air Force. As the name implies, the primary purpose of a teaching
lecture is to teach students about a given subject. Teaching lectures are either
formal or informal. Formal lectures are generally one-way with no verbal
participation by the students. Informal lectures are usually presented to
smaller audiences and allow for verbal interaction between the instructor and
students.</span></p>

<p><span>14.13.4.3.<b>&nbsp;Formal
Speech.</b>&nbsp;A formal speech generally has one of three basic purposes: to
inform, persuade, or entertain. The informative speech is a narration
concerning a specific topic but does not involve a sustained effort to teach.
Orientation talks and presentations at commander's call are examples of
informative speeches. The persuasive speech is designed to move an audience to
believe in or take action on the topic presented. Recruiting speeches to high
school graduating classes and court-martial summations are speeches primarily
developed to persuade. The entertaining speech gives enjoyment to the audience.
The speaker often relies on humor and vivid language to entertain listeners. A
speech to entertain is appropriate at a Dining-Out.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.14. Effective Listening:</span></b></p>

<p><span>14.14.1.&nbsp;<b>Understanding the Listening
Process.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To
better understand the listening process, let's begin by distinguishing between
hearing and listening. Hearing occurs when your ears pick up sound waves being
transmitted by a speaker or some other source. Hearing requires a source of
sound and an ear capable of perceiving sound. Hearing does not require the
conscious decoding of information.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.2.&nbsp;<b>Listening To Make Sense.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Listening,
on the other hand, involves making sense out of what is being transmitted.
Listening involves not only hearing, it involves attending to and considering
what is heard. Effective listening is an active process. Active listening
involves exerting energy and responding appropriately in order to hear,
comprehend, evaluate, and remember the message.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.3.&nbsp;<b>The Importance of Listening.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Listening
is especially important in the Air Force, and actually in any military unit.
Success is literally a matter of life and death, and we routinely
maintain/operate equipment worth millions of dollars. Receiving, comprehending,
and remembering spoken information is critical. Any miscommunication is
potentially catastrophic. Effective listening helps to build the trust and
mutual respect needed to do our jobs. Military personnel must understand their
team members and the situation. Leaders with good listening skills often make
better decisions and have a stronger bond with their Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.&nbsp;<b>Pick the Right Tool for the
Job: Informative, Critical, or Empathic Listening.</b></span></p>

<p><span>There are different
situations where listening is important and different reasons to listen.
Everyone must understand</span></p>

<p><span>the importance for
acknowledging and identifying these differences because appropriate listening
behaviors in one situation are sometimes inappropriate in another situation.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Informative
Listening.</b>&nbsp;In informative listening, the listener's primary concern is
to understand information exactly as transmitted. A successful listening
outcome occurs when the listener understands the message exactly as the sender intended.
Suggestions for improving informative listening are to:</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Keep
an Open Mind.</b>&nbsp;If the primary goal is to understand the message, set
aside your preconceptions about the topic and just listen.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Listen
as if You Had to Teach It.</b>&nbsp;Typically, we expend more effort to
understand a subject when we know that we have to teach a subject to someone
else. By taking this approach, we have the mental fortitude to focus longer,
ask questions when we do not understand, and think more deeply on a topic.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Take
Notes.</b>&nbsp;Focus on main points, and do not attempt to capture everything.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.1.4.&nbsp;<b>Respond
and Ask Appropriate Questions.</b>&nbsp;Good informative listening questions
help you clarify and confirm your understanding of the message.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.1.5.&nbsp;<b>Exploit
the Time Gap Between Thinking and Speaking Speeds.</b>&nbsp;The average
speaking rate is 180 words per minute; the average processing rate is 500 words
per minute. Use this extra time to mentally repeat, forecast, summarize, and
paraphrase the speaker's remarks.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Critical
Listening.</b>&nbsp;Critical listening is usually thought of as the sum of
informative listening and critical thinking. The listener is actively analyzing
and evaluating the message the speaker is sending. Critical listening is appropriate
when seeking input to a decision, evaluating the quality of staff work or a
subordinate's capabilities, or conducting research. Suggestions for improving
critical listening are to:</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Take
Notes.&nbsp;</b>As with informative listening, focus on main points, and do not
attempt to capture everything.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Listen
as if You Had to Grade It.</b>&nbsp;One of the few things more difficult than
teaching is grading another's work. By taking this approach, we have the mental
fortitude to focus longer, ask questions when we do not understand, and think
more deeply on a topic.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Exploit
the Time Gap Between Thinking and Speaking Speeds.</b>&nbsp;Critical listening
is different from informational listening in that you need to try to understand
first and evaluate second. Even when you are listening critically, do not
mentally argue with the speaker until the message is complete.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Ask
Appropriate Questions.</b>&nbsp;Good critical listening questions will be
probing in nature to thoroughly evaluate the intellectual content of the
speaker's message.</span></p>

<p><span>14.14.4.3.<b>&nbsp;Empathic
Listening.&nbsp;</b>Empathic listening is often useful when communication is
emotional or when the relationship between speaker and listener is just as
important as the message. Use this type of listening as a first step in the
listening process, a prerequisite to informational or critical listening.
Empathic listening is often appropriate during mentoring and nonpunitive
counseling sessions and is very helpful when communicating with family members.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 14E Electronic
Communications and the Internet</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.15. E-mail.</span></b></p>

<p><span>E-mail
is defined as the electronic transmission of information over computer-based
messaging systems. Recent technological advancements have increased
opportunities for more timely, efficient, and effective text-based
communications. These advancements facilitated the explosive growth of e-mail
use throughout the Air Force at all levels. To uphold a commitment to secure
messaging, the Air Force has established guidelines to ensure standardized and
responsible use by all Air Force members.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.16. Identity Management.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A vital element for
messaging security is the implementation of public key infrastructure and
common access cards for identity management. Public key infrastructure allows
for the authentication of the sender identity using a digital signature and the
encryption and decryption of the message. Users of Department of Defense
electronic messaging are directed to follow current Air Force guidance for the
use of public key infrastructure to sign and encrypt e-mail.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.17. Defense Message System.</span></b></p>

<p align="right"><span>The defense message
system is the core messaging system of record for the Department of Defense and
the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>Defense message system
is a flexible, commercial-off-the-shelf based application that provides
messaging services to all Department of Defense users (including deployed
tactical users) and interfaces to other United States government agencies,
allied forces, and defense contractors.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.18. Air Force Organizational Messaging.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Organization simple mail
transfer protocol mailboxes may be used for all organizational messaging
requirements unless usage of defense message system is required in support of
combatant command responsibilities.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.19. Individual Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>All
government communications systems are subject to monitoring, interception,
search, and seizure for all authorized purposes. Government-provided messaging
systems are for official use and limited authorized personal use only.
Individuals must:</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.1. Maintain
responsibility for the content of their electronic messages and ensure that
messages sent adhere to acceptable use of Internet-based capabilities.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.2.
Maintain sent and received information according to Air Force records
management directives. Emails may be subject to requests under the freedom of
information act, litigation, and court orders. If requested, individuals are
responsible for reviewing messages in email accounts and all backups to locate
responsive material.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.3. Adhere to local
policy on sending electronic messages to a large number of recipients. Digital
images, as well as mass distribution of smaller messages, may delay other
traffic, overload the system, and subsequently cause system failure.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.4. Adhere to local
policy when sending an electronic message to mail distribution lists. Use web
pages or electronic public folders for unofficial electronic messages (i.e.,
booster club activities, etc.).</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.5. Only reply to
electronic messages that absolutely require a response and minimize the use of
the Reply to All function.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.6. Bear sole
responsibility for material sent.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.7. Properly
coordinate and staff electronic messages according to local directives.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.8. Take
appropriate action on non-delivery notices or message rejects to ensure
messages reach the intended recipient.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.9. Not
auto-forward electronic messages from the .mil domain to a commercial internet
service provider.</span></p>

<p><span>14.19.10. Not
indiscriminately release electronic messaging addresses to the public. For
further information reference the Air Force Freedom of Information Act; Release
of Email Addresses.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.20. Privacy Act Information.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Privacy Act of 1974 requires agencies to provide safeguards to ensure the
security and confidentiality of records and to protect individuals against an
invasion of personal privacy.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Exercise caution before transmitting personal
information over e-mail to ensure the message is adequately safeguarded. When
information is so sensitive and personal, e-mail is not the proper way for
transmitting this information. When sending personal information over e-mail
within Department of Defense, ensure:</span></p>

<p><span>14.20.1. There is an
official need.</span></p>

<p><span>14.20.2. All addressees
(including  cc  addressees) are authorized to receive personal information under
the Privacy Act.</span></p>

<p><span>14.20.3.
 For official use only  is added to the beginning of the subject line, followed
by the subject, and apply the following statement at the beginning of the
e-mail:  This e-mail contains for official use only information which must be
protected under&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Privacy Act&nbsp;</span></i><span>and AFI 33-332.  Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to
e-mails and use only in situations when you are actually transmitting personal
information.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.21. E-mail Protocol.</span></b></p>

<p><span>E-mail protocol provides
guidelines for proper behavior while on-line. There are many ways to make
social blunders and offend people when you are posting. Respect the social
culture, and remember that the net is multicultural. Nuances get lost in
transmission.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.1.&nbsp;<b>Rule 1<i> </i>Be Clear and Concise:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.21.1.1. Make sure the
subject line communicates your purpose.<b>&nbsp;</b>Be specific and avoid
ambiguous titles.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.1.2. Lead with the
most important information. If the goal is to answer a question, then paste the
question at the top of the page for clearer understanding.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.1.3. Use topic
sentences if the e-mail has multiple paragraphs.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.1.4. Be brief and
stick to the point. Address the issue, the whole issue, and nothing but the
issue.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.1.5. Use bold,
italic, or color to emphasize key points.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.1.6. Choose
readable fonts. Use 12 point or larger when possible.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.2.<b>&nbsp;Rule 2<i> </i>Watch Your Tone:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.21.2.1. Be polite.
Treat others as you want to be treated. Think of the message as a personal
conversation.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.2.2.
Be careful with humor, irony, and sarcasm. Electronic postings are perceived
much more harshly than they are intended, mainly because the receiver cannot
see the sender's body language or hear the tone of voice, or any other
nonverbal cues that make up 90 percent of interpersonal communications.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.2.3. DON T SHOUT.
Do not write using all CAPITAL LETTERS this is the e-mail equivalent of
shouting and is considered rude.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.2.4. Keep the
email clean and professional. E-mail is easily forwarded. Harassing,
intimidating, abusive, or offensive material is unacceptable.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.3.<b>&nbsp;Rule 3<i> </i>Be Selective
About What Message You Send and Do Not:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.21.3.1. Discuss
controversial, sensitive, for official use only, classified, personal, Privacy
Act, or unclassified information requiring special handling of documents.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.3.2. Forget
operations security. Remember operations security, even unclassified
information, when brought together with other information, can create problems
in the wrong hands.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.3.3. Create junk
mail, forward email, or put email on a bulletin board.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.3.4. Create or
send chain letters. They waste time and tie up the system.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.3.5. Use e-mail
for personal ads.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.4.&nbsp;<b>Rule 4<i> </i>Be Selective
About Who Gets Your Message:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.21.4.1. Reply to
specific addressees to give those not interested a break.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.4.2. Use  reply
all  sparingly.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.4.3. Get
permission before using large mail groups.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.4.4. Double-check
the address before mailing, especially when selecting from a global list where
many people have similar last names.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.5.&nbsp;<b>Rule 5<i> </i>Check Your
Attachments and Support Material:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.21.5.1. Ensure all
information is provided the first time to keep from repeating e-mail just to
add another fact.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.5.2. Before
sending ensure that you have attached the attachments; this is the most common
mistake.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.5.3. Cite all
quotes, references, and sources. Respect copyright and license agreements.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.6.&nbsp;<b>Rule 6<i> </i>Keep Your E-mail
Under Control:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.21.6.1. Sign off the
computer when you leave your workstation.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.6.2. Create
mailing lists to save time.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.6.3. Read and
delete files daily. Create an organized directory on your hard drive to keep
mailbox files at a minimum. Ensure record copies are properly identified and
stored in an approved filing system.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.6.4. Acknowledge
important or sensitive messages with a reply to sender; for example, Thanks,
done, I will start working the details in the email immediately, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>14.21.6.5.
When away from your e-mail for an extended period, consider setting up an  Auto
Reply  message to let people know how long you will be unavailable via e-mail,
as well as providing alternate points of contact for questions that require
immediate answers or response.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 14F Conducting
an Effective Interview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.23. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Many
Air Force positions require a job interview. Knowing how to prepare for and
conduct yourself during this process can go a long way toward helping you get
that special duty or some other much-coveted job in the Air Force. This section
is designed to help you prepare for and succeed in conducting an effective Air
Force interview:</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.1.&nbsp;<b>Purpose of Interviews.</b>&nbsp;So, you ve found
a new job in the Air Force one that requires special talents and experience;
one that requires you to gather letters of recommendation, submit a resume, and
provide copies of your last five enlisted performance reports (EPR);&nbsp;<b><i>and</i></b>&nbsp;one
that requires you to sit through a job interview. If you ve ever completed a
special duty assignment or worked at certain headquarters assignments, chances
are you ve already sat through a job interview. However, for many Airmen out
there, the Air Force job interview is a new experience one requiring
preparation, practice, and perseverance.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.1.1.
Before you set off for that interview, there are a few things you will need to
understand about the interview process. First, you need to understand the
purpose of the job interview. All job interviews are designed with one goal in
mind: to find the right person for a particular job. As military members, many
of you will sit through job interviews to get that special job or position
you ve been looking for. Understanding that employers may have to interview
several member for the position, should give you some respect for the process
and help you understand that your goal in an interview is to convince the
interviewer that&nbsp;<b><i>you</i></b>&nbsp;are the right person for the job.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.1.2. The second thing you should know
about interviews is that they are a two-way process. You are not only
interviewing for a job; you are interviewing the prospective employer to see if
you actually want the job. Are you willing to spend the next 2-3 years of your
career in this organization? Are you willing to work under the conditions laid
out in the job description? Are you willing to make a permanent change of
station for the position? There are a host of other concerns you should have in
mind when preparing for the interview, many of which should center on your
desire for the job and working in the new organization.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.1.3.
Third, you need to understand that interviews are information-sharing events
between you and the interviewer. Your job is to convince the interviewer that
your unique knowledge, skills, and abilities are a perfect match for the
position you re seeking. Conversely, the interviewer's job is to sift through
reams of information gathered from numerous interviews and eventually match
the&nbsp;<b><i>right</i></b>&nbsp;person to the position. The interviewer is
basically asking each interviewee the same question:  Why should I hire&nbsp;<b><i>you</i></b>? 
while all interviewees are also highlighting their particular skills for the
job.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.2.&nbsp;<b>Types of Interviews.</b>&nbsp;As
you ve just read, the purpose of the interview is to find the best person for
the job. However, interviews can be conducted in several different ways.
14.23.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Face-to-face Interviews:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.23.2.1.1.
Face-to-face interviews usually take place in one of two formats: the
individual interview or the panel interview. The individual interview may be
the person who will supervise you or someone higher in the chain of command.
Hiring decisions are often made based on this type of interview. Count on
discussing your skills, experience, and training, and how they all relate to
the job.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.2.1.2.
A selection panel or board interview is frequently used when organizations are
filling a managerial position. Usually, three or more people sit on the board,
and all candidates are asked the same questions. A selection board interview
usually involves more structured questions than an individual interview. This
interview can be stressful because you have to answer questions from several
people. Be sure to make eye contact with everyone on the panel. When answering
a question, you should make eye contact with the person asking the question.</span></p>







<p><span>14.23.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Phone Interviews:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.23.2.2.1.
The phone interview is another strategy organizations use to select highly
qualified Airmen. In this situation, the hiring organization interviews
applicants over the phone. These interviews are sometimes used to make
first-round cuts to the applicant pool.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.2.2.2.
If you apply for a special assignment, chances are the location will be away
from your current assignment. In this case, the hiring organization usually
conducts the entire interview over the phone. In these situations, there are no
second chances to make a good impression, and decisions are based strictly on
the phone interview.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.&nbsp;<b>Interviewing:&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Pre-interview Preparations:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.1.
One of the first things you need to do to prepare for any Air Force job
interview is to carefully study the job advertisement or position description.
This provides you with information on the particular knowledge, skills, and
abilities for which the hiring organization is looking. What experience or
skills are required for the job? Do you have the required experience or skills?
Note the key responsibilities of the job and try to match your knowledge,
skills, and abilities to those requirements and you should make the connections
now because you will be asked to do the very same thing during the interview.
This first step helps you understand how your talents measure up to the
requirements for the position you re seeking.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.2.
The next step is to gather all required information and documentation for the
application process. In many cases, you will need to submit past EPRs, a
personnel report on individual personnel, a resume, letters of recommendation,
and a cover letter. A targeted resume and letters of recommendation should
highlight your particular knowledge, skills, and abilities, and relate them to
the position for which you re applying. A cover letter should target one or two
strengths not mentioned in your EPRs, resume, or letters of recommendation.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.3.
One important aspect to consider before the interview is to conduct research on
the mission and history of the hiring organization before the interview. Who
are the commander and senior enlisted members of the organization? How large is
the organization? What are the mission and vision statements? If you know
someone who works in the organization, you should call him or her and ask some
particular questions about the organization. Are there any mission changes in
the foreseeable future? How many enlisted personnel are assigned there? Has the
organization done anything noteworthy in the past 2 or 3 years? The more you
know about the organization, the better job you will do of convincing potential
employers that you care about the organization, as well as the job you re
seeking.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.4.
When preparing for any interview, think about and write down your strengths and
weaknesses. Identify two or three strengths that target the knowledge, skills,
and abilities in the job advertisement. Next, identify one or two weaknesses
that can be turned into strengths (for example, I m detail oriented but not a
micromanager). Putting your strengths and weakness on paper allows you to study
and become intimately familiar with them and builds your confidence as you
prepare for the interview. As you write down your strengths and weaknesses,
develop specific examples that highlight your skills. You will be asked to
provide examples of your experience during the interview. Developing
examples&nbsp;<b><i>before</i></b>&nbsp;the interview can only help make the
interview flow more smoothly.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.5.
Use job descriptions and bullets from past EPRs to develop possible questions
employers might ask during the interview. Remember, employers know exactly what
they are looking for, and they are using the interview process to find the
right person to fill the position. Put yourself in the interviewer's shoes and
develop a set of questions you would ask if you were them. Then, develop
answers to the questions you just came up with. If your EPRs were sent as part
of the application package, you can bet some of the questions will be targeted
toward specific achievements highlighted. Include specific, concrete examples
that not only highlight your skills but also tie directly to the specific
requirements of the job. Some examples of areas to concentrate on are: (1)
problem-solving skills; (2) thoughts on Air Force transformation; (3)
team-building skills; (4) how you support the Chief of Staff of the Air Force
priorities; (5) leadership philosophy; (6) ability to adapt and work in
fast-paced environments; (7) handling criticism; and (8) decision making
ability.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.6.
Also, be able to answer the following questions: Why should I hire&nbsp;<b><i>you</i></b>?
How soon can you report? If applicable, how does your family feel about the
move? Where do you see yourself in 2 to 3 years? Are there any personal issues
that may prevent you from accepting or performing in this position?</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.7.
Develop a list of questions to ask potential employers. Interviewers expect
candidates to ask intelligent, thoughtful questions concerning the organization
and the nature of the work. The nature and quality of your questions reveals
your interest in the organization and the position you re seeking. Ensure your
questions are employer-centered; avoid self-centered questions that might
indicate you are primarily interested in knowing about the benefits of the
position. Potential questions should center on (1) duties and responsibilities
of the job; (2) possible mission changes in the organization; (3) chain of
command or lines of responsibility; (4) unique requirements of the
organization; and (5) a typical day in the organization.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.1.8. Finally, you need to practice,
practice, practice. Practice how you will get out of your car. Practice how you
will walk into the room. Practice how you will answer questions. Practice how
you will ask questions. Practice your nonverbals. Practice anything you think
you will do before, during, or after the interview. This will make you more
comfortable and confident and will help you perform better during the
interview. If possible, have friends and family conduct mock interviews.
Practice in front of a mirror if mock interviews are impossible or impractical.
The bottom line here is practice, practice, practice!</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Listening
Skills.</b>&nbsp;Listening during the interview is as essential to your success
as talking openly and honestly about knowledge, skills, and abilities.
Concentrate on what is being said and how it is said, rather than how you are
doing. By listening to the interviewer's statements, comments, and questions,
you gain a better understanding of the organization and what workplace would be
like to work there. If you pay close attention, you can probably hear the
 questions behind the questions' your interviewer asks. In other words, pay
close attention and read between the lines for what is&nbsp;<b><i>not</i>&nbsp;</b>being
said in the interview, and you can probably pick up useful nuggets of
information that can benefit you during the interview. For instance, if the
interviewer continually asks about your ability to develop and motivate teams
or seems to refer to getting teams to work better, you may pick up a possible
team-development issue within the organization. With this information, you can
sell your ability to lead and motivate teams and possibly land yourself the
job.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.&nbsp;<b>The Actual Interview.</b></span></p>

<p><span>As
mentioned earlier, most will be interviewed in one of two ways: by phone or in
person. If conducted by phone, the interview begins the moment you pick up the
phone and ends once you hang up. On the other hand, personal interviews begin
the moment you get out of your car and end when you drive out of the parking
lot. Either way, the interview is the one best chance you have of  selling
yourself  to any potential employer. Whether you interview by phone or in
person, there are certain rules you should keep in mind: (1) keep your answers
concise; limited to about 2-3 minutes; (2) provide specific examples of your skills
and achievements; (3) tie your strengths to the requirements of the job; (4)
ask questions; (5) maintain a conversational tone throughout the interview; and
(6) keep important documents nearby (such as EPRs, resumes, letters of
reference, etc.).</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.1.&nbsp;<b>The Phone Interview.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To
some, the phone interview may seem less important than a personal interview
because the interview is conducted from different locations and removed from
direct observation of the interviewer. However, in many aspects, the phone
interview is more difficult than a personal interview. For instance, in a
personal interview you can usually gauge how the interview is going by paying
attention to the interviewer's nonverbals. On the other hand, with a phone
interview there are no visual cues to tell you how you are doing. Therefore,
there are some areas you will have to pay close attention to if you want to
successfully navigate through a phone interview. Here are a few tips to help
you succeed:</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.1.1.
Smile during the interview, just as you would in a personal interview. While
hiding behind a phone allows you to disguise your body language, there is no
way you can disguise your vocal cues due to nonverbals. Smiling during a phone
interview keeps you energetic and helps project enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.1.2.
Keep a mirror in front of you during the interview. This allows you to see your
own expressions and will help to ensure you are smiling and paying attention to
your body language. Just because the interviewer can t see you doesn t mean he
or she is not listening for details of your nonverbal responses during the
interview. A mirror also ensures you conduct yourself in much the same way you
would in a personal interview. You would not put your feet on a desk during a
personal interview, would you? Of course not! So keep your feet off your desk
during a phone interview. Believe it or not, your body posture naturally
reflects in your voice. If your posture is slacking while you are on the phone,
you can bet your vocal tone will convey that. Keeping a mirror in front of you
will help you focus on your body language and nonverbal responses.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.1.3.
Know when to speak, and then when to stop. In a personal interview, you can
usually tell from the interviewer's nonverbals when you need to wrap up an
answer or move on. Phone interviews are often filled with long, silent pauses.
Do not feel that you need to fill that dead space with conversation. Pay close
attention to the tone of the interviewer's voice and know when to stop talking
and move on.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.1.4. Develop
notes for telephone interviews. These notes should include a list of your
strengths and weaknesses and how your skills match organizational needs.
Develop a list of potential questions employers might ask, along with possible
responses. Practice delivering responses so that you will be ready to give
polished answers in a clear confident tone. Do not memorize canned answers
since they are likely to sound canned over the phone. Instead, use the script
to trigger appropriate responses that sound both spontaneous and energetic. Do
not forget to ask questions. Questions for potential employers should be part
of your script and should be kept readily available during the interview. Keep
in mind, the real key to success in any interview is practice.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.&nbsp;<b>The Personal Interview:</b></span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.1.
In many cases, personal interviews begin the moment you get out of your car and
do not end until you drive away. Many prospective employers will observe you as
you walk from your car to the front door of the building or office. Others will
purposely let you sit in a waiting area for 10 to 20 minutes. All of this is
designed to create tension and provide the employer an opportunity to observe
your bearing before the actual interview begins. We cannot overstate that you
are on the interviewing clock even though you are not sitting in an
interviewing room.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.2.
In job interviews, potential employers judge you on how you look and act, not
just on what you say. Your actions, mannerisms, and appearance are reflected in
your body language. They give nonverbal information about your work-related
skills, attitudes, and values. Research shows that 65 percent of meaning in any
interaction is conveyed nonverbally. In many interviews, nonverbal cues are just
as important as verbal information in determining who is hired. After all, each
person the organization interviews is probably qualified for the job.
Therefore, you want to appear&nbsp;<b><i>more</i></b>&nbsp;qualified than
anyone else do not let your nonverbals cost you a job.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.3.
The first thing required for the interview is to ensure you are wearing the
proper uniform. You should get this information before the interview, but check
before the interview to make sure. Your dress and appearance is the first
nonverbal message you send to any employer, so ensure you are squared away and
nothing is out of place.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.4.
Offer a firm (but not&nbsp;<b><i>too</i></b>&nbsp;firm), warm, whole-hand
handshake. Shake hands with both men and women the same way. You would not give
men and women different salutes, so do not offer them different handshakes.
Practice your handshake before the interview.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.5.
Make eye contact with the interviewers. Your eyes are your most powerful
communication tools, and many interviewers use eye contact to determine
enthusiasm, sincerity, and possible inconsistencies in your responses. If you
use natural eye contact, the interview will become more like a conversation
between acquaintances and you will get over some of your nervousness.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.6.
Sit up straight, but not stiff, and lean slightly forward toward the
interviewer. As the interview progresses, you may want to mirror the body
language of the interviewer. If the interviewer takes a more relaxed posture,
then you should relax too but not too much. If the interviewer is more formal,
then you need to mirror that formal behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.7.
Use natural gestures. If you normally use your hands to gesture as you talk, do
so during the interview. Gestures help you relax, convey enthusiasm, and
release nervous energy. Be careful, though, to avoid nervous gestures such as
drumming your fingers, playing with a pencil, jingling the change in your
pocket, tapping your feet, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.8. Speak
clearly and evenly not too fast, but not too slow. Expression is a powerful way
to show enthusiasm. Do not speak in a monotone voice. Allow your volume to rise
and fall, and pronounce words clearly. Use good grammar and diction, and always
think before you speak. The interviewer will assess your communication skills
based on how clearly you express yourself.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.9.
Notice the nonverbal cues of the interviewer. His or her facial expressions
will let you know how well he or she is listening and may give you clues as to
how you are doing. For instance, if the interviewer seems distracted or
inattentive, you will need to shorten your answers, use examples, or ask
questions.</span></p>

<p><span>14.23.4.2.10.
As the interview ends, take 2 to 3 minutes to summarize. This gives you a
chance to end the interview on a positive note, convey your interest in the
position, and sell yourself one more time. During the summary, recap one or two
of the key points of the interview and restate how your experience and skills
match those required for the position.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.24. Post-interview Actions:</span></b></p>

<p><span>14.24.1. Once the
interview is complete, two things will increase your chances of success and
help you learn from your experience. First, send a short (two or three
paragraphs) thank-you note to the organization with which you interviewed. The
letter should be typed or handwritten and should express your gratitude for the
interview opportunity. Restate your interest in the position and highlight any
particularly noteworthy points made in your conversation or anything you wish
to further clarify. This is also an opportunity to add anything you forgot or
wish you had said in the interview. Close the letter by mentioning that you
will call in a few days to inquire about the employer's decision. Always mail
the letter within a day or two of the interview.</span></p>

<p><span>14.24.2. The second thing
is to make a few notes about the interview. Record some of the questions asked
and how you answered them. Write down your strong and weak points from the
interview. Make a list of what made the interview successful, what you would
change, and what you need to improve. These notes can be invaluable information
for you to review and work on for future interviews.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.25. Interview Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
job interview is the most important step in any job-search process. Many Airmen
will undergo the rigors of an interview for special positions during the course
of their careers. Understanding the purpose of the job interview and your role
in successfully planning for and conducting a proper interview can greatly
increase your chances of landing a coveted job in the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 14G Staff-Level
Communication</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.26. Spoken Communication via the Meeting.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Meetings are used to
share information, solve problems, plan, brainstorm, or motivate. Whatever
their purpose, you need to know some basics about conducting an effective
meeting.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.<b>&nbsp;Planning the Meeting.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Success or failure in a
meeting can usually be traced to the planning phase. The key issues associated
with planning a meeting are listed below. As you review these items, remember
to check on what are standard operating procedures in your organization.
Meetings come in all flavors from totally spontaneous to highly structured and
ceremonial. Most are in the middle. If a group has been meeting regularly for a
while, try to find out how they have done business in the past.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Decide if the Meeting is
Appropriate.</b>&nbsp;If you can achieve the goal by speaking face-to-face with
one or two people, scheduling a formal meeting might not be necessary. If the
goal is to just pass on information, consider if sending an e-mail is a viable
and appropriate substitute for the meeting.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Define
the Purpose.</b>&nbsp;Every meeting should have a purpose and if there is no
purpose, you should not meet. When thinking about the purpose, define in terms
of the product wanted at the end of the meeting and what purpose will the
product be used for.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Decide
Who Should Be Invited.</b>&nbsp;Invite only those directly involved in the
issues being discussed. If you are trying to solve a problem or make a decision
on a controversial issue, make sure you have adequate representation from all
groups who have a voice in the decision. If you only invite people with one
point of view, your meeting will run smoothly, but your decision may not stand
up later.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.4.&nbsp;<b>Decide
Where and When the Meeting Should Occur.</b>&nbsp;Ensure the time is convenient
for the people who are required to be there, keep the meeting under an hour, or
plan for breaks. Finally, reserve the room.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.5.&nbsp;<b>Plan
for Capturing Meeting Information.</b>&nbsp;If this is not a routine meeting
with an appointed recorder, take a moment to think about how you will capture
the meeting information, both in the meeting itself and afterwards.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Capturing
Information during the Meeting.</b>&nbsp;This can be done by using standard
note-taking procedures. Ensuring your meeting place has either a dry erase
board, butcher paper, or other note-taking capabilities will assist in getting
this accomplished.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Capturing
Information after the Meeting.</b>&nbsp;Meeting minutes capture the process and
outcome of the meeting. Minutes  close the loop  on the meeting and let the
attendees know what was decided.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.1.6.&nbsp;<b>Send
Out an Agenda.</b>&nbsp;Create an agenda and send the agenda to attendees no
later than 1 or 2 days before the meeting. The agenda should include the date,
time, location, and purpose of the meeting. This advance notice gives everyone
an opportunity to prepare their thoughts and know where the meeting is going
before they get there.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.2.<b>&nbsp;Running the Meeting.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Avoid dragging out a
meeting unnecessarily.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Start
on Time; Stay on Time.</b>&nbsp;Meetings should start on time with an upbeat
note, so do not wait for tardy attendees. State your desired outcome.</span></p>



<p><span>14.26.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Follow
the Agenda.</b>&nbsp;People generally don t like when a meeting deviates from
the agenda. Review the agenda in the opening minutes of the meeting to remind
everyone of the goals and plan for the meeting.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Understand Group Dynamics.</b>&nbsp;If
you are in charge of a group that will meet over a period of time, you should
learn the basics about group dynamics. In group dynamics which will be
experienced in meetings, teams or groups move through predictable stages. To
avoid frustration, becoming familiar with these stages is important.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.2.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Forming
Stage.&nbsp;</b>When a team is forming, members cautiously explore the
boundaries of acceptable group behavior. The forming stage is a stage of
transition from individual to member status, and of testing the leader s
guidance, both formally and informally. Because so much is going on to distract
the members' attention in the beginning, the team accomplishes little, if
anything, that is concerned with the project goals. Do not be overly concerned;
this is perfectly normal!</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.2.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Storming
Stage.</b>&nbsp;Probably the most difficult stage for the team is the storming
stage. The team members begin to realize the task is different and more
difficult than imagined and they become testy, accusatory, or overzealous.
Impatient about the lack of progress, but still too inexperienced to know much
about decision making or the scientific approach, members argue about what
actions the team should take. They try to rely solely on their personal and
professional experience, resisting any need for collaborating with other team
members. Their behavior means team members have little energy to spend on
progressing toward the team's goal, but they are beginning to understand one
another.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.2.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Norming
Stage.&nbsp;</b>During the norming stage, members reconcile competing loyalties
and responsibilities. They accept the team, team ground rules (or  norms ),
their roles in the team, and the individuality of fellow members. Emotional
conflict is reduced as previously competitive relationships become more
cooperative. As team members begin to work out their differences, they now have
more time and energy to spend on the project. Thus, they are able to at last
start making significant strides.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.2.3.4.&nbsp;<b>Performing
Stage.</b>&nbsp;By the time of the performing stage, the team has settled their
relationships and expectations. At last, team members have discovered and
accepted each other's strengths and weaknesses and learned what their roles
are. The team is now an effective, cohesive unit. They can begin
performing diagnosing and solving problems, and choosing and implementing
changes. You can tell when your team has reached the performing stage because
you start getting a lot of work done finally!</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.3.&nbsp;<b>Follow up: Preparing Meeting
Minutes.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Follow
up involves sending out meeting minutes and starting the whole cycle over
again. Prepare meeting minutes in the official memorandum format. Minutes are a
clear summary of the participants' comments and document planned or completed
actions.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.3.1. Date the
minutes the day they are distributed. The names of members present may be
listed in two columns to save space.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.3.2. Place
information regarding a future meeting in the last paragraph.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.3.3.
When a person signs a paper as a member of a board or committee, the signature
element indicates that person's status on that board or committee, not any
other position the person may hold. To approve the minutes, type  Approved as
written  two lines below the recorder's signature block, followed by the
approving authority's signature block.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.3.4. Minutes are
typed either single or double-spaced, with additional space between items of
business and paragraphs.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.3.5. The format
should be neat and orderly, paying particular attention to uniformity of
margins and text.</span></p>

<p><span>14.26.3.6. Spell names correctly,
use acceptable grammar, and construct and punctuate sentences well. All verbs

<p><b><i><span>Section 14H Instruments
of Written Communication</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>14.27. Bullet Background Paper.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
bullet background paper is an excellent tool designed to present concisely
written statements centered on a single idea or to present a collection of
accomplishments with their respective impacts. Refer to Figure 14.9 for
additional information on the bullet background paper.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.28. Air Force IMT 1768,&nbsp;<i>Staff Summary
Sheet</i>.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Use
the staff summary sheet to summarize staff work, request action, or forward
information. Staff summary sheets often contain several handwritten notes
before reaching the approval authority; therefore, they do not require the same
level of perfection (error-free typing, etc.) as the correspondence they may
cover. Refer to Air Force Handbook 33-337 for information on filling out the
staff summary sheet.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.29. Electronic Staff Summary.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Electronic staff summary
requiring your group or wing commander's signature should be sent through your
internal channels via e-mail. The office of primary responsibility transmits
the package via e-mail to the first reviewer to coordinate and comment. The
first reviewer should forward (never reply) the package with comments (if any)
to the next reviewer. This procedure is repeated until the last reviewer has
coordinated on the package. The last reviewer forwards the entire package back
to the office of primary responsibility.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.30. Trip Report.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A trip report describes
a temporary duty trip to another location and includes the purpose, travelers,
itinerary, discussions, and conclusions or recommendations.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.31. Staff Study Report.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Use
the staff study report to analyze a clearly defined problem, identify
conclusions, and make recommendations. Not all organizations routinely use a
staff study report, but it is an accepted format for a problem-solution report
in both Air Force and Joint Staffs. The staff study report should represent
completed staff work. This means the staff member has solved a problem and
presented a complete solution to the boss. The solution should be complete
enough that the decision maker has only to approve or disapprove.</span></p>

<p><b><span>14.32. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Clear,
concise, well-thought-out, and well-composed communication is essential for
meeting the needs of today's Air Force. We are all involved in speaking and
writing to some extent. Therefore, we must become proficient at the methods we
use. The meeting is an important forum for providing information, solving
problems, and answering questions. Written communication is also another area
crucial to meeting the Air Force mission. Fortunately, we have several
instruments at our disposal to help us with the process. The staff summary
sheet, bullet background paper, trip report, and staff study report all serve a
useful purpose and are tools that help facilitate staff-level communication.</span></p>



<p align="center"><b><span>Chapter 15</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>PERSONNEL PROGRAMS</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 15A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.1.1.
The Air Force requires military members to be prepared to serve and support the
mission at all times. Force support organizations ensure Airmen and their
families are cared for, pay and entitlements are properly addressed, and their
individual rights are secure. Airmen need to comprehend the enlisted
assignments, family care, reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits
and services, personnel records and individual rights, the awards and
decorations program, and the enlisted promotion systems programs and policies.
Each of these areas has an impact, in some form or fashion, on every Airman;
therefore, understanding the individual nuances associated with each of these
programs is a necessity for all Airmen. The senior NCO promotion program,
manpower management and requirements, competitive sourcing, and civilian
personnel management programs, are all necessary areas of focus for our
aspiring senior NCOs. A basic understanding of these subject areas are required
to effectively lead Airmen and manage programs.</span></p>

<p><span>15.1.2.
The Air Force mission requires military members to be prepared for service at
all times. Mission support organizations ensure Airmen's families are cared
for; pay and entitlements are properly addressed; and individual rights are
secured. This chapter includes information on enlisted assignments, family
care, reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits and services,
personnel records, individual rights, the awards and decorations program, and
the enlisted promotion system.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 15B Enlisted
Assignments</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.2.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>General Information.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Qualified
Airmen must be in the right jobs at the right time to accomplish the Air Force
mission. The Air Force classifies and assigns Airmen worldwide as equitably as
possible to ensure a high state of readiness. The Air Force also recognizes a
need for special assignment considerations to take care of Air Force Airmen
with exceptional needs. The Air Force uses a coherent and logical classification
system to identify valid manpower requirements, to identify and describe each
Air Force occupational specialty, to ensure minimum prerequisite standards are
set for each specialty, and to ensure qualified Airmen are placed into each
specialty. While the primary consideration in selecting Airmen for reassignment
is the Airmen's qualifications to accomplish the mission, the Air Force also
considers additional factors:</span></p>

<p><span>15.2.1. To the maximum
extent possible, the Air Force assigns Airmen on a voluntary basis and in the
most equitable manner feasible.</span></p>

<p><span>15.2.2. The Air Force
equitably distributes involuntary assignments among similarly qualified Airmen
to minimize family separation and to avoid creating a severe personal hardship
on Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>15.2.3.
Limitations may be established on involuntary selection for permanent change of
station following some temporary duties to allow Airmen to attend essential
military and personal pre-permanent change of station requirements, as well as
to reduce Airmen and family turbulence.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.3. Assignment Authority.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The
Department of Defense allocates funds, delegates authority, and directs
policies for the permanent change of station assignment of Airmen to satisfy
national security requirements. Permanent change of station assignments may
also be directed to ensure equitable treatment of Airmen, such as permanent change
of station from overseas to the continental United States upon completion of
the prescribed overseas tour. Air Force Instruction 36-2110,&nbsp;<i>Assignments,</i>&nbsp;is
the governing instruction for operational (including rotational), training
(including formal education and professional military education) and force
structure assignments.</span></p>

<p><span>15.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Assignment Requests.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>The director of
assignments (or equivalent) in coordination with major commands, field
operating agencies, and direct reporting units is authorized to initiate
assignments for Airmen currently assigned to major commands, field operating
agencies, or direct reporting units to fill valid vacant manpower
authorizations. Air Force Personnel Center is the final approval authority for
Airman assignments. The Airman Assignment Division is the final approval
authority for Airman assignments in the grades of Senior Master Sergeant and
below. The Chiefs Group is the final approval authority for Chief Master
Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant-select assignments.&nbsp;</span></p>





<p><span>15.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Distribution of Personnel.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen
are distributed to meet the overall needs of the Air Force according to law and
Department of Defense and Air Force directives and instructions; as equitably
as possible between major commands, within a specialty and grade; according to
guidance from the Air Staff functional area office of primary responsibility;
and as directed by the designated assignment authority outlined in AFI 36-2110.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.4. Assignment Policy and Procedures:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Equal Opportunity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force assigns
Airmen without regard to color, race, religious preference (except chaplains),
national origin, ethnic background, age, marital status (except military
couples), spouse's employment, education or volunteer service activities of
spouse, or gender (except as provided for by statute or other policies). This
applies to both permanent change of station and temporary duty assignments. The
primary factor in selecting Airmen for permanent change of station is the
Airmen's qualifications to fill a valid manpower requirement and perform
productively in the position for which being considered. When Airmen with the
required qualifications are identified, then permanent change of station
eligibility criteria and other factors are considered.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Special Experience Identifier.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
special experience identifier system complements the assignment process and is
used in conjunction with grade, Air Force specialty code, Air Force specialty
code prefixes and suffixes, etc., to match uniquely qualified Airmen to jobs
with special requirements. Special experience identifiers may be used when
specific experience or training is critical to the job, and no other means is
appropriate or available. The special experience identifier system is also used
to rapidly identify Airmen to meet unique circumstances, contingency
requirements, or other critical needs. Manpower positions are coded with a
special experience identifier to identify positions that require or provide
unique experiences or qualifications. The personnel records for the Airmen who
earn a special experience identifier are similarly coded.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Security Access Requirement.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Manpower
positions often require Airmen assigned to have access to a specified level of
classified information. However, sometimes the urgency to fill a position does
not allow selection of Airmen using permanent change of station eligibility
criteria and subsequent processing (and/or investigation) for access at the
specified level. Under these circumstances, selection may be necessary from
among Airmen who currently have access or can be granted access
immediately.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.4.4.<b>&nbsp;Grade, Air Force Specialty Code,
and Skill-Level Relationship for Assignment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Chief
Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects may be assigned in any Air
Force specialty code or chief enlisted manager code they possess or are
qualified to be awarded. Normally, Airmen in the grade of Senior Master
Sergeants and below are selected for assignment in their control Air Force
specialty code. Airmen with an incompatible grade and control Air Force
specialty code skill level because of retraining or reclassification are
selected for assignment and allocated against requirements commensurate with
their grade, regardless of their control Air Force specialty code skill level.
Normally, Airmen are selected based on their grade and skill level. Chief
Master Sergeants fill chief enlisted manager code positions; Senior Master
Sergeants fill 9-skill level positions; Master Sergeants and Technical
Sergeants fill 7-skill level positions; Staff Sergeants and Senior Airman fill
5-skill level positions; and Airman First Class, Airman, and Airman Basic fill
3-skill level positions.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.5.&nbsp;<b>Volunteer Status and Permanent
Change of Station Eligibility.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Within
a group of qualified Airmen who meet the minimum eligibility criteria for
permanent change of station selection, volunteers are selected ahead of
nonvolunteers. Furthermore, nonvolunteers qualified to fill a requirement who
meet the minimum permanent change of station eligibility criteria are selected
ahead of qualified volunteers who do not meet permanent change of station
eligibility criteria. For example, time on station is a permanent change of
station eligibility requirement. A qualified volunteer who meets the minimum time
on station requirement is considered first in order of longest on station.
Next, the qualified nonvolunteer who meets the time on station requirement in
the order of longest on station, and finally the qualified volunteer who does
not meet the time on station requirement may be considered; however, qualified
volunteer will require a time on station waiver.</span></p>







<p><span>15.4.6.&nbsp;<b>Chief Master Sergeant
Development.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Headquarters
Air Force/DPE uses the Chief Master Sergeant assignment policies to support the
continued development of Chief Master Sergeants. Because Chief Master Sergeants
are Air Force senior leaders, these policies are comparable with other senior
leader assignment and development methods. Policies include:</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.6.1.<b>&nbsp;Three-year
Limits for Headquarters Staff and Special Duty Tours.&nbsp;</b>Chief Master
Sergeants serving in major command, Headquarters Air Force, and Joint Staff
positions, as well as special duty positions will be limited to serving 3-year
tours. This increases the opportunities for Chief Master Sergeants to serve in
these positions, enhancing their development. Additionally, this improves the
flow of field experience into headquarters staff positions and staff experience
into base-level units.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.6.2.<b>&nbsp;Date
Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) Management.&nbsp;</b>DEROS adjustment
requests, like DEROS extensions, indefinite DEROSs, and in-place consecutive
overseas tours, are closely scrutinized for Chief Master Sergeants and only
considered if in the best interest of the Air Force and supportive of Chief
Master Sergeant development. Subsequently, DEROS adjustments are not routinely
approved for Chief Master Sergeants.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.6.3.<b>&nbsp;Home-Basing
Requests.&nbsp;</b>In addition to closely scrutinizing DEROS adjustment
requests, the Chiefs Group also uses the same criteria to review home-basing
requests, which are also not routinely approved. The same rationale used in
paragraph 15.4.6.2 applies.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.6.4.<b>&nbsp;Nominative
Selection for Strategic-Level Assignments.&nbsp;</b>Specific strategic-level
assignments such as Air Force career field managers and command Chief Master
Sergeants are filled using a nominative selection process. The hiring authority
for these positions requests nominations from appropriate organizations,
frequently each major command. Each organization then identifies their most
qualified Chief Master Sergeants for the advertised position and nominates them
to the hiring authority. The hiring authority then selects the best Airman for
the job. This highly competitive process ensures a significant level of
visibility and senior leader involvement in selecting Chief Master Sergeants to
serve in these top positions.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.6.5.<b>&nbsp;Command
Chief Master Sergeant Assignments.&nbsp;</b>Command Chief Master Sergeant
assignments are&nbsp; 2-year minimum and
3-year maximum tours. This ensures an appropriate balance between fresh
enlisted leadership and leadership stability within organizations.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.7.&nbsp;<b>First-Term Airmen.</b></span></p>

<p><span>First-Term
Airmen serving an initial enlistment of 4 or more years may not be given more than
two assignments in different locations following initial basic and skill
training during their first 4 years of service, regardless of tour length.
First-Term Airmen who make two permanent change of station moves are permitted
an additional permanent change of station in conjunction with an approved
humanitarian reassignment or a join spouse assignment, as a volunteer, or when
the permanent change of station is a mandatory move. Low-cost moves are
excluded from the two-move count.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.<b>&nbsp;Availability and Deferment.&nbsp;</b>Airmen are
considered available for reassignment on the first day of the  availability 
month. Deferments may be authorized, when possible in most grades and Air Force
specialty codes, to maintain an equitable assignment system and also support
the need for stability in certain organizations or functions. The reasons for
deferments vary.</span></p>

<p><span>Deferments
are normally approved to preclude an Airman's permanent change of station while
suitability to remain on Regular Air Force is evaluated or during a period of
observation or rehabilitation. Deferments also exist for such things as
completion of an educational program or degree, witness for a court-martial,
accused in a court-martial, control roster, Article 15 punishment, base of
preference program, retraining, humanitarian reasons, etc. AFI 362110 contains
a complete list of deferments.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.1.&nbsp;<b>Humanitarian
Reassignment, Expedited Transfers and Exceptional Family Member Program
Reassignment or Deferment.</b>&nbsp;Policies and procedures concerning humanitarian
reassignment, Expedited Transfers and Exceptional Family Member Program
reassignment or deferment are outlined in AFI 36-2110. These policies and
procedures include but are not limited to:</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.1.1.
The Humanitarian Program provides reassignment or deferment for Airmen to help
them resolve severe short-term problems involving a family member. The problem
must be resolvable within a reasonable period of time (normally 12 months); the
Airman's presence must be considered absolutely essential to resolve the
problem; and the Airman must be effectively utilized in his or her control Air
Force specialty code at the new assignment. Family members under the
humanitarian program are limited to spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law,
and those people who have served  in loco parentis.  A person  in loco
parentis' refers to one who has exercised parental rights and responsibilities
in place of a natural parent for at least 5 years before the Airman's or
spouse's 21st birthday, or before the Airman's entry to the Regular Air Force,
whichever is earlier. While brothers and sisters are not included in the
definition of family member for humanitarian consideration, a request involving
a brother's or sister's terminal illness will be considered as an exception to policy.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.1.2. The</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Exceptional Family Member Program is a separate and distinct
program from humanitarian policy.</span></p>

<p><span>The
Exceptional Family Member Program is based on an Airman's need for special
medical or educational care for a spouse or child that is required long term,
possibly permanently. Therefore, this program is not a base-of-choice program,
as assignment decisions are based on manning needs of the Air Force at
locations where the special medical or educational needs for a spouse or child
can be met. The Air Force's commitment and responsibilities under the
Exceptional Family Member Program requires mandatory enrollment and
identification of exceptional family members. Under the Exceptional Family
Member Program, an Airman may receive a reassignment if a need arises for
specialized care that cannot be met where currently assigned. A deferment from
an assignment may be provided for a newly identified condition if the Airman s
presence is considered essential. The purpose of such a deferment is to allow
the Airman time to establish a special medical treatment program or educational
program for the exceptional family member. When granted, the initial period of
deferment is usually 12 months, after which an Airman may be reconsidered for
permanent change of station, if otherwise eligible.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.1.3. Expedited
Transfers are a separate and distinct program from the humanitarian policy and
applies to only</span></p>

<p><span>Regular
Air Force members who are sexually assaulted and file an unrestricted report.
The Airman may request an Expedited Transfer with assistance from the Sexual
Assault Prevention and Response Office. If an Airman is the victim of stalking
or other sexual misconduct (i.e. indecent viewing, visual recording, or
broadcasting; forcible pandering; indecent exposure) and files a report, the
Airman may also request an expedited transfer with assistance from the Victim
and Witness Assistance Program in the installation's Legal Office. An expedited
transfer request initiated on behalf of another will not be accepted. Only
exception applies to the vice wing commander applying on behalf of the alleged
offender. To enhance protection for the sexual assault victim, potential
reassignment of the alleged offender shall be considered by the vice wing
commander (or equivalent), balancing interests of the sexual assault victim and
the alleged offender. An Airman (victim or alleged offender) will generally
only be delayed from departing permanent change of station when they are
required to remain for completion of a criminal or disciplinary investigation
or action in which they are the subject. All assignment action codes must be
removed from the Airman's personnel file in order to facilitate permanent
change of station eligibility. Retraining or cross-flow actions will be considered
under this program on a case by case basis as the goal for transferring the
Airman is a timely reassignment with minimal disruption to an Airman's career
and family.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.2.<b>&nbsp;Base
of Preference (Enlisted Only).</b>&nbsp;The first-term Airmen base of preference
program is a reenlistment incentive. The Career Airman base of preference
program is an incentive for other Airmen to continue an Air Force career.
First-term Airmen in conjunction with reenlistment or retraining may request a
permanent change of station from continental United States-to-continental
United States or permanent change of station from overseas-tocontinental United
States. First-term Airmen in the continental United States (only) may request a
base of preference to remain in place. A permanent change of station base of
preference is not authorized from continental United States-to-overseas or
overseas-to-overseas. An in-place base of preference is not authorized for
Airmen assigned overseas. Career Airmen may request a base of preference to remain
in place at a continental United States location or a permanent change of
station base of preference for continental United States-to-continental United
States assignment.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.3.&nbsp;<b>Assignment
of Military Couples (Join Spouse).&nbsp;</b>Each Airman of a military couple
serves in his or her own right. This means military couples must fulfill the
obligations inherent to all Airmen. They are considered for assignments to fill
valid manning requirements and must perform duties that require the skills in
which they are trained. Provided these criteria are met, military couples may
be considered for assignments where they can maintain a joint residence.
Military couples share the responsibility for reducing family separation. They
should not make decisions on future service, career development, or family
planning based on the assumption they will always be assigned to the same
location or that join spouse assignment is guaranteed.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.4.&nbsp;<b>Voluntary
Stabilized Base Assignment Program (Enlisted Only).</b>&nbsp;The Voluntary
Stabilized Base Assignment Program provides Airmen a stabilized tour in
exchange for volunteering for an assignment to a historically hard-to-fill
location. Application procedures are listed in AFI 36-2110.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.5.<b>&nbsp;Extended
Long Overseas Tour Length.&nbsp;</b>The extended long overseas tour volunteer
program applies to Airmen who volunteer for permanent change of station
overseas to a long-tour location (one where the accompanied tour length is 24
months or more, and the unaccompanied tour length is more than 15 months).
Airmen who volunteer for an extended long overseas tour agree to serve the
standard tour length plus an additional 12 months. Tour lengths for various
overseas locations are listed in the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume 1,
Appendix Q. Extended long overseas tour volunteers are considered ahead of
standard overseas tour volunteers according to the priorities shown in AFI
36-2110. The 12-month extended tour period is in addition to the normal
(accompanied or unaccompanied) long tour length the Airman must serve. A change
in status affects the service retainability that must be obtained and the tour
length the Airman will be required to serve. The requirement for additional
service retainability may require an Airman to extend or reenlist and could affect
selective reenlistment bonus calculation.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.6.<b>&nbsp;Educational
Deferment.</b>&nbsp;Airmen who have not yet been selected for a permanent
change of station may request deferment from assignment selection when they
have nearly completed a vocational program or college degree requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.7.&nbsp;<b>High
School Senior Assignment Deferment Program.</b>&nbsp;The High School Senior
Assignment Deferment Program allows Senior Master Sergeants and below and
officers through Lieutenant Colonel to apply for a 1-year assignment deferment.
Back-to-back deferments may be possible and military-married-to-military
spouses may also apply. As in all situations, however, the needs of the Air
Force will come first and will be the determining factor in granting
deferments. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and deferments
will be approved where possible.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.8.&nbsp;<b>Temporary
Duty.</b>&nbsp;AFI 36-2110 provides instructions regarding temporary duty
procedures. The maximum temporary duty period at any one location in a 12-month
period is 180 days unless the Secretary of the Air Force grants a waiver. To
the degree possible, Airmen are not selected for involuntary overseas permanent
change of station while performing certain kinds of temporary duty.
Additionally, if selected for involuntary permanent change of station after one
of these temporary duties, the report no later than date will not be within 120
days of the temporary duty completion date.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.8.9.<b>&nbsp;Dependent
Care and Adoption.</b>&nbsp;All Airmen ensure dependent care arrangements are made
when they are separated because of temporary duty or permanent change of
station. Military couples with dependents and single Airmen sponsors are
expected to fulfill their military obligations on the same basis as other
Airmen. They are eligible for worldwide duty and all assignments for which they
qualify. To ensure all Airmen remain available for worldwide duty, they must
have workable plans to provide parent-like care for their dependents as
outlined in AFI 36-2908,<i>&nbsp;Family Care Plans</i>. Airmen who cannot or
will not meet military commitments due to family needs will be considered for
discharge. Airmen adopting children are given a limited time to complete the
official adoption process and facilitate bonding. Airmen may be authorized
deferment during the 6-month period following the date a child is officially
placed in the Airmen's home. Airmen may also be authorized up to 21 days of
permissive temporary duty that can be used in conjunction with ordinary leave.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.9.&nbsp;<b>Time on Station and Service Retainability.&nbsp;</b>Minimum
time on station requirements exist to provide continuity to an Airman s
member's unit and, to the degree possible, reasonable periods of stable family
life for Airmen. Further, upon selection for permanent change of station, an
Airman must have or be able to obtain certain minimum periods of obligated
service depending on the type of permanent change of station move. This
committed service retainability ensures an Airman has a period of Regular Air
Force remaining long enough to offset the costs associated with a permanent
change of station. Minimum time on station provides continuity to the gaining
unit and stability to Airmen and their families following permanent change of
station. Some types of permanent change of station require time on station
periods or obligated service periods more or less than the normal limits. Refer
to AFI 36-2110 for the time on station and retainability requirements for
specific types of permanent change of station.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.9.1.&nbsp;<b>Continental
United States-to-Continental United States Permanent Change of Station.</b>&nbsp;For
most permanent change of station moves within the Continental United States,
first-term Airmen and career Airmen must have at least 48 months of time on
station, with the exception of first-term Airmen applying eligible for the
firstterm Airmen base of preference program. Special circumstances, such as
completion of a training course in permanent change of station status, have
different time on station minimums. The service retainability requirement for a
Continental United States-to-Continental United States permanent change of
station is 24 months regardless of career status.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Continental United
States-to-Overseas Permanent Change of Station.</b>&nbsp;First-term Airmen must
have at</span></p>

<p><span>least 12 months of time
on station to go from Continental United States to overseas. Career Airmen
require&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>24
months of time on station before an overseas permanent change of station. When
notified of permanent change of station selection, Airmen must have or be
eligible to obtain sufficient service retainability to complete the full
prescribed overseas tour length elected Airmen who do not have retainability
may decline to obtain retainability or, if eligible, may retire instead of
accepting a permanent change of station. Declining to obtain retainability for
permanent change of station will affect a career Airman by making him or her
ineligible for promotion and reenlistment. First-term Airmen become ineligible
for most voluntary assignments. Airmen who are eligible and desire that their
dependents accompany them at government expense during their overseas tours
must serve the  accompanied by dependents' overseas tour length. This tour is
normally longer than the unaccompanied tour. Electing to serve the longer
accompanied tour requires the Airman to obtain the obligated service
retainability for the longer tour. Airmen who are either ineligible or decline
to obtain the service retainability for the accompanied tour length will not
receive approval for dependent travel at the government's expense or command
sponsorship.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.9.3.&nbsp;<b>Overseas-to-Overseas
Permanent Change of Station.</b>&nbsp;If an Airman is serving overseas and is a
volunteer for a permanent change of station consecutive overseas tour or in-place
consecutive overseas tour, the Airman must complete the full-prescribed tour at
the current location and the full-prescribed overseas tour at the new location
or another full tour in place.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.9.4.<b>&nbsp;Overseas-to-Continental
United States Reassignment.</b>&nbsp;Reassignment from overseas to continental
United States requires the Airman, in most cases, to have or obtain at least 12
months of obligated service retainability. The exceptions are those Airmen
serving at a dependent restricted short tour location of 12 months Airmen who
do not have retainability will be retained in the overseas area involuntarily
until their date of separation.<b>&nbsp;</b>15.4.10.<b>&nbsp;Enlisted Quarterly
Assignments Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus.</b></span></p>

<p><span>EQUAL
provides Airmen a listing of the assignment requirements available for upcoming
assignment cycles and allows them the opportunity to align personal preferences
to actual Air Force needs. The listing identifies what assignments, by Air
Force specialty code and grade, are available at particular locations. The
EQUAL-Plus supplements the EQUAL and is used to advertise requirements for
special duty assignments, joint and departmental assignments, short-notice
oversea assignments, and all Chief Master Sergeant assignments. EQUAL-Plus
shows upcoming requirements, any special qualifications an Airman needs to be
eligible for selection, the available locations, reporting instructions, and
points of contact for additional information. Both lists can be viewed on the
Air Force Personnel Services Web page at</span><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing"><span>https://gum</span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing"><span>-</span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing"><span>crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing</span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/landing"><b><span>.</span></b></a></p>

<p><span>15.4.11.<b>&nbsp;Assignment Preferences
(Enlisted Only).</b></span></p>

<p><span>Chief
Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects volunteer for assignments on
EQUAL-Plus by notifying their assignment noncommissioned officer at
Headquarters Air Force Senior Leadership Management Office. Notification can be
made via telephone, e-mail, datafax, or electronic message. Senior Master
Sergeants and below will use the view/change assignment preference update
feature in the virtual military personnel flight to record continental United
States or overseas assignment preferences. To enhance the chance for selection
to a desired location, Airmen should consult the EQUAL and EQUAL-Plus listings.
Upon completion of the update, a notice is produced and available for print. (<b>Note:&nbsp;</b>Each
Airman is individually responsible for the currency and accuracy of assignment
preferences.) When a change in status occurs such as marriage, the Airman
should update preferences accordingly. Outdated preferences or no preferences
on file will not be the basis for release of an Airman from an assignment for
which selected.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.11.1.&nbsp;<b>Home-Basing
and Follow-On Assignment Programs.</b>&nbsp;The purpose of these programs is to
reduce permanent change of station costs, reduce permanent change of station
turbulence, and increase stability for Airmen and their families by providing
advance assignment consideration. The servicing military personnel section must
brief all eligible Airmen selected for or electing to serve an unaccompanied
overseas tour of 15 months or less on these programs. Airmen must either apply
or decline to apply for these programs in writing. AFI 36-2110, Attachment 5,
contains more information on these programs.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.11.2.&nbsp;<b>Assignment
of Family Members.</b>&nbsp;Assignment of family members to the same duty
location or unit is not prohibited, however, family members will not be
assigned where one family member will or may hold a command or supervisory
position over another family member. Such assignments result in, or may create
a perception of, preferential treatment or loss of impartiality, thereby
compromising the integrity of command and supervisory functions.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.12.<b>&nbsp;Permanent Change of Station
Cancellation by the Air Force:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.4.12.1.
Once an Airman is selected for permanent change of station and orders are
published, cancellation of the assignment could impose a hardship on the
Airman. Normally, a permanent change of station is not cancelled within 60 days
of the projected departure date unless the Airman cannot be effectively used at
the projected location. The assignment office of primary responsibility may
authorize the cancellation.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.12.2.
If the Airman indicates a hardship will exist as a result of the cancellation,
then the military personnel section will direct the Airman to prepare a written
statement containing the details of the hardship. The statement should be
coordinated through the unit commander to the military personnel section. Upon
receipt, the military personnel section advises the assignment office of
primary responsibility, who considers reinstatement of the original assignment,
to provide an alternate assignment or confirms cancellation and provides the
reasons why the Airman is required to remain at the present base.</span></p>

<p><span>15.4.12.3. AFI 36-2110
contains additional information and also contains guidance in the case where an
Airman has departed from his or her previous duty station and is en route to
the new location.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 15C Family Care
Plans</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.5. Policy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Department
of Defense policy is that the member is responsible for the care of family
members during deployments and temporary duty, as at all other times. Failure
to produce a family care plan within 60 days of the discussion with the
commander, supervisor, or commander's designated representative may result in
disciplinary action and/or administrative separation. In addition to a required
family care plan, military members are strongly encouraged to have a will.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.6. Members Who Must Have a Family Care Plan.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Single-member
parents with custody of children and bear sole or joint responsibility, and
military couples with dependents must have a family care plan. Members who are
solely responsible for the care of a spouse, elderly family member, or adult
family member with disabilities who is dependent on the member for financial,
medical, or logistical support (housing, food, clothing, transportation, etc.)
must also have a family care plan. This includes family members who have
limited command of the English language, are unable to drive, or gain access to
basic life-sustaining facilities. Members whose family circumstances or
personal status change must notify their commander as soon as possible but no
later than 30 days after any change in circumstance or personal status requires
them to establish a family care plan.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.7. Family Care Plans.</span></b></p>

<p><span>These
plans must include provisions for short-term absences (such as temporary duty
for schooling or training) and longterm absences (such as operational
deployments) and designate a caregiver for the affected family members.
Financial arrangements may include powers of attorney, allotments, and other
documents necessary for logistical movement of the family or caregiver should
any of these arrangements become necessary. Additional items may be required to
fit individual situations.</span></p>

<p><span>15.7.1.<b>&nbsp;Required Counseling:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.7.1.1.&nbsp;<b>New
Duty Station.</b>&nbsp;Commanders or first sergeants counsel all Airmen with
family members on AFI 362908 during inprocessing. During this counseling,
commanders and first sergeants must stress the importance of, and confirm the
need for, family care certification by completing Air Force IMT 357,&nbsp;<i>Family
Care Certification</i>. Commanders or first sergeants may not delegate
counseling requirements.&nbsp;<b>Note:&nbsp;</b>For members who are
geographically separated from the commander's location, commanders may
delegate, in writing, the authority to counsel members and certify the Air
Force IMT 357 to detachment or operating location chiefs.</span></p>

<p><span>15.7.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Annual
Briefing.</b>&nbsp;The commander or first sergeant is required to annually
brief, individually, all military members who require an Air Force IMT 357
about their family care responsibilities. During this briefing, the commander
or first sergeant signs the Air Force IMT 357 each time the plan is reviewed
and certified, determining the actual workability of the family care plan. The
member signs and dates the Air Force IMT 357 to document the briefing was
completed.</span></p>

<p><span>15.7.2.&nbsp;<b>Remedial Action.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Members who fail to make
adequate and acceptable family care arrangements will have disciplinary or
other actions taken against them.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.8. Who Must Document Their Family Care Plan
on the Air Force Form 357.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force members to
included Department of Defense Civilian Expeditionary Workforce members who
meet the following criteria will develop and maintain a Family Care Plan:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.8.1. Single parents
who have custody of a child and bear sole or joint responsibility for the care
of children under the age of 19 or others unable to care for themselves in the
absence of the member.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.8.2. Dual-military
couples with dependents.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.8.3.
Married service members with custody or joint custody of a child whose
non-custodial biological or adoptive parent is not the current spouse of the
Member, or who otherwise bear sole responsibility for the care of children
under the age of 19 or for other unable to care for themselves in the absence
of the member.&nbsp;<b><i>EXAMPLE</i></b>: The military member had a child
with, or adopted a child with a previous spouse and then they divorced or
separated. Then the military member gained full or partial custody of the
child.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.8.4. Members
primarily responsible for dependent family members and meet one or more other
criteria outlined AFI 36-2908, paragraph 1.2.</span></p>

<p><span>15.8.5.
Civilian and contractor personnel in emergency essential positions are strongly
encouraged to establish family care plans consistent with this instruction.
Civilian and contractor personnel should also avail themselves and their
caregivers of the information, support, and resources provided by the Airman and
Family Readiness Center and social service organizations within legal
constraints.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.9. When to Implement the Family Care Plan.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Air Force members will implement their family
care plan when required to be absent from their family members.<b>&nbsp;</b>This
includes single parents or military couples assigned to a
family-member-restricted area and activation of noncombatant evacuation
operations or other emergency evacuation situations if assigned overseas with
family members.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.10. Duty
Deferments.&nbsp;</span></b><span>To assist Air Force
military members in the development of family care plans and establishing a
pattern of childcare, service members shall receive the following deferments
from duty:</span></p>

<p><span>15.10.1. Military
mothers of newborns receive a 4-month deferment from duty away from the home
station for the period immediately following the birth of a child.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.10.2. Single service
members, or one member of a dual-military couple who adopts, receive a 4 month
deferment from duty away from the home station from the date the child is placed
in the home as part of the formal adoption process.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.10.3.
Reserve Component members who are mothers of newborns, single Reserve Component
members who adopt, and one member of a dual-military couple in the Reserve
Component who adopts shall receive a 4-month deferment from involuntary call to
Regular Air Force immediately following the child's birth or placement in the
home.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.10.4. Air Force military members, who may be
deployed in an area for which imminent danger pay is authorized, may request a
deferment of deployment due to unforeseen family circumstances in accordance
with DoDI 1342.19.&nbsp;<b><i>Section 15D Reenlistment and Retraining
Opportunities</i></b></span></p>

<p><b><span>15.11. Selective Reenlistment Program.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The selective
reenlistment program applies to all enlisted personnel and the objective is to
ensure the Air Force retains only Airmen who consistently demonstrate the
capability and willingness to maintain high professional standards.</span></p>

<p><span>15.11.1.<b>&nbsp;Selective Reenlistment by
Category.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In
the Air Force, reenlistment is a privilege, not a right. The selective
reenlistment program provides a process by which commanders/civilian directors
and supervisors evaluate all first term, second term, and career Airmen.
Firstterm Airmen receive selective reenlistment program consideration when they
are within 15 months of their expiration of term of service. Second term and
career Airmen with less than 19 years of total active federal military service
are considered within 13 months of the original expiration of term of service.
Career Airmen also receive selective reenlistment program consideration when
within 13 months of completing 20 years of total active federal military
service. Once career Airmen have served beyond 20 years of total active federal
military service, they receive selective reenlistment program consideration
each time they are within 13 months of their original expiration of term of
service.</span></p>

<p><span>15.11.2.<b>&nbsp;Responsibilities:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.11.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Unit
Commander/Civilian Director.</b>&nbsp;The unit commander/civilian director has
total selective reenlistment program selection and nonselection authority for
all Airmen and may non-select any Airman for reenlistment at any time outside
of their selective reenlistment program window. Reenlistment intent or
retirement eligibility has no bearing on the selective reenlistment program
consideration process. Unit commanders/civilian directors approve or deny
reenlistment and ensure selection or nonselection decisions are consistent with
other qualitative decisions (such as promotion) and are based on substantial
evidence. Commanders/directors consider enlisted performance report ratings,
unfavorable information from any substantiated source, the Airman's willingness
to comply with Air Force standards, and the Airman's ability (or lack thereof)
to meet required training and duty performance levels when determining if a
member may reenlist. Commanders/directors may reverse their decisions at any
time. Commanders/directors do not use the selective reenlistment program when
involuntary separation is more appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>15.11.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Immediate
Supervisor.&nbsp;</b>Supervisors provide unit commanders/directors with
recommendations concerning the Airman's career potential. The supervisor s
rater may perform the duties required by the immediate supervisor if the
immediate supervisor is on leave or temporary duty. To ensure Airmen meet
quality standards, immediate supervisors review the report on individual
personnel and the Air Force Form 1137,&nbsp;<i>Unfavorable Information File
Summary&nbsp;</i>(if applicable). They then evaluate duty performance and
leadership abilities.</span></p>

<p><span>15.11.3.<b>&nbsp;Procedures:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.11.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Selection.</b>&nbsp;The
military personnel section sends each unit a selective reenlistment program
consideration roster that identifies assigned Airmen who require selective
reenlistment program consideration. The military personnel section also sends a
report on individual personnel for each Airman being considered. The unit
forwards the report on individual personnel to supervisors so that each
supervisor's reenlistment recommendation can be documented. The supervisor
should carefully evaluate the Airman's duty performance and review the Airman s
personnel records before making a recommendation to the commander. A supervisor
who decides to recommend the Airman for reenlistment places an  X  in the
appropriate block, signs the report on individual personnel, and returns the report
to the unit commander. The commander reviews the recommendation and evaluates
the Airman's duty performance, future potential, and other pertinent
information. The commander selects the Airman for reenlistment by annotating
and signing the selective reenlistment program roster. The commander s
signature on the roster constitutes formal selection. The commander sends the
selective reenlistment program roster to the military personnel section for
processing.</span></p>

<p><span>15.11.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Nonselection.</b>&nbsp;If
the supervisor decides not to recommend an Airman for reenlistment, he or she
initiates an Air Force Form 418,&nbsp;<i>Selective Reenlistment Program
Consideration for Airmen in the Regular Air Force/Air Force Reserve</i>, and
completes Section I and Section II and forwards to the commander. The commander
reviews the recommendation and other pertinent data and decides whether to
select the Airman. If the commander does not select the Airman for
reenlistment, the commander completes Section III of the Air Force Form 418 and
informs the Airman of the decision. During the interview, the commander must
make sure the Airman understands the right to appeal the decision. The Airman
must make known his or her intention within three workdays of the date the
Airman acknowledges the nonselection decision. The Airman must submit the
appeal to the military personnel section within 10 calendar days of the date he
or she renders the appeal intent on the Air Force Form 418, Section V. The
commander sends the Air Force Form 418 to the military personnel section after
the Airman signs and initials the appropriate blocks.</span></p>

<p><span>15.11.4.<b>&nbsp;Appeals.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Airmen
have the right to appeal selective reenlistment program nonselection decisions.
The specific appeal authority is based on an Airman's total active federal
military service. First-term Airmen and career Airmen who will complete at
least 20 years of total active federal military service on their current
expiration of term of service appeal selective reenlistment program
nonselection to their respective group commanders. The Airman's respective wing
commander is the selective reenlistment program appeal authority for second
term and career Airmen who will complete fewer than 16 years of total active
federal military service on their current expiration of term of service. The
Secretary of the Air Force is the selective reenlistment program appeal
authority for second term and career Airmen who will complete at least 16 years
of total active federal military service but fewer than 20 years of total
active federal military service on their current expiration of term of service.
The decision of the appeal authority is final. The appeal authority's decision
is documented on the Air Force Form 418, and the Airman is advised of the
outcome.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.12. Enlistment Extensions.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Any
Airman serving on a Regular Air Force enlistment may request an extension if he
or she has a service-directed retainability reason and in the best interest of
the Air Force. Extensions are granted in whole-month increments. For example,
if the individual needs 15   months of retainability for an assignment, the
individual must request a 16-month extension. Voluntary extensions for all
Airmen are limited to a maximum of 48 months per enlistment. In the event Air
Force specialty codes are constrained, Air Staff may limit first-term Airmen
extensions to a specified period. Certain situations (such as citizenship
pending) may warrant exceptions to policy. Once approved, an extension has the
legal effect of the enlistment agreement by extending the period of obligated
service. Extensions can only be canceled if the reason for the extension no
longer exists, given the Airman has not entered into the extension. For
example, if a member was approved for an extension due to an assignment and
that assignment was canceled, the member could then cancel the extension within
30 calendar days provided they have not entered into the extension period.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.13.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>High Year of Tenure.</b></span></p>

<p><span>High
year of tenure provides the Air Force with another method of stabilizing the
career structure of the enlisted force. High year of tenure essentially
represents the maximum number of years Airmen may serve in their current grade
AFI 363208,&nbsp;<i>Administrative Separation of Airmen</i>, contains waiver
provisions for Airmen who believe they have sufficient justification to warrant
retention beyond their high year of tenure, but the majority of Airmen are not
permitted to reenlist or extend their enlistments if their new date of
separation exceeds their high year of tenure. Airmen may be eligible to request
an extension of enlistment to establish a date of separation at high year of
tenure too separate or retire. Normally, Airmen must be within 2 years of their
high year of tenure before they can extend.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.14. Selective Retention Bonus.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
selective retention bonus is a monetary incentive paid to enlisted members to
attract reenlistments in, and retraining into, critical military skills with
insufficient reenlistments to sustain the career force in those skills.
Headquarters United States Air Force adds and deletes skills from the selective
retention bonus list as requirements change. The military personnel section is
the best source of information on selective retention bonus skills.</span></p>

<p><span>15.14.1.&nbsp;<b>Zones.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The selective
reenlistment bonus is paid in four zones based on total active federal military
service:</span></p>

<p><span>15.14.1.1. Zone A
applies to Airmen reenlisting between 17 months and 6 years.</span></p>

<p><span>15.14.1.2. Zone B
applies to Airmen reenlisting between 6 and 10 years.</span></p>

<p><span>15.14.1.3. Zone C
applies to Airmen reenlisting between 10 and 14 years.</span></p>

<p><span>15.14.1.4. Zone E
applies to Airmen reenlisting between 18 and 20 years.</span></p>

<p><span>15.14.2.&nbsp;<b>Computing Selective Retention
Bonus Awards.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force calculates the selective retention bonus on the basis of monthly base
pay (the rate in effect on the date of discharge [day before reenlistment date]
or the day before an extension begins) multiplied by the number of whole years
incurred on reenlistment, multiplied by the selective retention bonus multiple
for the skill. The selective retention bonus is only payable for obligated
service not exceeding 24 years of active service. The maximum selective
retention bonus payable to eligible Airmen is $90,000 per zone. Eligible Airmen
may receive a selective retention bonus in each zone but only one selective
retention bonus per zone (for example, they can receive the last zone A payment
and the first zone B payment during the same year). The Air Force, based on
current policy directives, may pay up to 100 percent of the bonus amount (less
tax) at the time of reenlistment or extension and the remaining percent in
equal installments on the anniversary of the reenlistment or extension date.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.15.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Career Job Reservation Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Because
of various career force size and composition restrictions, there are times when
the Air Force must place a limit on the number of first-term Airmen who may
reenlist. The Career Job Reservation Program exists to assist in the management
of first-term Airmen reenlistments, by Air Force specialty code, in order to
prevent surpluses and shortages. The Career Job Reservation Program can be
active or suspended based on Air Force requirements. When active and in use the
program details are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span>15.15.1.<b>&nbsp;When to Apply for a Career Job
Reservation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Headquarters
United States Air Force meets management requirements by establishing and
maintaining a career job requirements file for each Air Force specialty code.
Air Force specialty codes career job requirements are distributed over a
12-month period. All eligible first-term Airmen must have an approved Career
Job Reservation in order to reenlist. Airmen are automatically placed on the
Career Job Reservation waiting list on the 1st duty day of the month during
which they complete 35 months on their current enlistment (59 months for 6-year
enlistees), but no later than the last duty day of the month during which they
complete 43 months on their current enlistment (67 months for 6year enlistees
To keep their approved Career Job Reservation, Airmen must reenlist on or
before the Career Job Reservation expiration date.</span></p>

<p><span>15.15.2.&nbsp;<b>Career Job Reservation Waiting
List.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When
the number of Career Job Reservation applicants exceeds the number of available
quotas, Air Force Personnel Center must use a rank-order process to determine
which Airmen will receive an approved Career Job Reservation. Airmen compete
for a Career Job Reservation in their respective initial term of enlistment
group (4-year or 6-year enlistee). Applicants are ranked using the following
factors: unfavorable information file (automatic disqualifier), top three
enlisted performance reports, current grade, projected grade, date of rank,
total active federal military service date. Applicants are placed on the Air
Force-wide career job applicant waiting list when there are no Career Job
Reservations available. An Airman's position on the waiting list is subject to
change as his or her rank order information changes or as new Airmen apply.
Airmen may remain on the Career Job Reservation waiting list until their 43rd
month on their current enlistment (67 months for 6-year enlistees Supervisors
should encourage Airmen to pursue retraining into a shortage skill if a Career
Job Reservation is not immediately available.</span></p>

<p><span>15.15.3.&nbsp;<b>Career Job Reservation in an
Additionally Awarded Air Force Specialty Code.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When
Airmen are placed on the Career Job Reservation waiting list in their Air Force
specialty code, they may request a Career Job Reservation in an additionally

<p><b><span>15.16.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Air Force Retraining Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Retraining
is a force management program used primarily to balance the enlisted career
force across all Air Force specialty codes and ensure sustainability of career
fields. Retraining also provides a means to return disqualified Airmen to a
productive status. Additionally, the program allows a limited number of Airmen
the opportunity to pursue other career paths within the Air Force. The Air
Force encourages Airmen to voluntarily retrain first, however, the needs of the
Air Force may require Airmen to be involuntarily retrained to meet sustainment
objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>15.16.1.<b>&nbsp;First-Term Airmen Retraining
Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
first-term Airmen Retraining Program is designed to retrain first-term Airmen
in conjunction with a reenlistment, into skills where shortages exist and
additionally, allows a limited number of Airmen the opportunity to pursue other
career paths in the Air Force. Airmen maybe selected for involuntary retraining
based on Air Force needs to balance the force. Airmen may apply not earlier
than the 1st duty day of the month during which they complete 35 months of
their current enlistment (59 months for 6-year enlistees), but not later than
the last duty day of the 43rd month of their current enlistment (67 months for
6-year enlistees). On the last duty day of each month, Air Force Personnel
Center runs a retraining board to select the most eligible Airmen. This is not
a physical board, but a computer based one. Applications are prioritized on
quality indicators; e.g., most recent enlisted performance report (EPR) rating;
current grade; projected grade; next two EPR ratings; Date of Rank; Total
Active Federal Military Service Date; Aptitude Qualification Examination score
in the applicable area (electrical, mechanical, administrative, general or
combination in accordance with Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory,
Part II, Attachment 4 (Additional Qualifications)); requested Air Force
Specialty Code preferences.</span></p>

<p><span>15.16.2.&nbsp;<b>NCO Retraining Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The NCO retraining
program is designed to retrain second term and career Airmen from overage Air
Force specialties into shortage specialties to optimize the enlisted force to
best meet current and future mission needs. Airmen possessing a secondary, or additional
Air Force Specialty Code in a shortage skill, may be returned to the shortage
skill if in the best interest of the Air Force. This program consists of two
phases: Phase I (voluntary) and Phase II (involuntary). Retraining objectives
are determined by Air Staff.</span></p>

<p><span>15.16.3.&nbsp;<b>Online Retraining Advisory.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
online retraining advisory is a living document found on MyPers that is
maintained by the Air Force Personnel Center. The advisory is readily available
and a key tool to advise members of retraining opportunities. AFI

eligibility and application procedures.</span></p>

<p><span>15.17.8.&nbsp;<b>Health Care:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.17.8.1.
The transition from receiving care within the Military Healthcare System into
the Veterans Health Administration can be challenging and at times confusing.
Therefore, for caregivers to understand some of the basic differences between
the two is helpful.</span></p>

<p><span>15.17.8.2.
Military health care, known as TRICARE, is operated through the Department of
Defense and provides medical care for Regular Air Force and retired members of
the military and their dependents. The Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans
Health Administration provides health care for enrolled veterans and their
eligible family members through a network of hospitals and clinics across the
country.</span></p>

<p><span>15.17.8.3. The two
departments work together, but have different eligibility criteria, health
benefits and costs.</span></p>

<p><span>15.17.8.4. Also,
important is understanding the Veterans Administration consists of three
separate organizations: Veterans Affairs Healthcare, Veterans Affairs Benefits,
and Veterans Affairs National Cemeteries.</span></p>

<p><span>15.17.8.5.
Enrollment in the Veterans Affairs healthcare system meets the requirement for
having health care coverage under the new health care law, Affordable Care Act
that went into effect on 1 October 2013. Additional information on the
Affordable Care Act and Veterans Affairs can be found on the Veterans Affairs
website:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.va.gov/aca"><span>www.va.gov/aca</span></a><a href="http://www.va.gov/aca"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><b><span>15.18. Retirement Benefits.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Enlisted
members are eligible to retire if they have 20 years of total active federal
military service and there are no restrictions per AFI 36-3203. Enlisted
members must apply for retirement. Otherwise, they will separate on their date
of separation or expiration of term of service. Officers must have 20 years of
total active federal military service and 10 years of total active federal
commissioned service to be eligible to retire. A retirement application may be
submitted through virtual military personnel flight up to 12 months, but no
less than 120 days, before the desired retirement date. Every individual who
hopes to retire one day should be familiar with this information. The
retirement application is not allinclusive, and there are exceptions. Every
military member should seek personal counseling from the Total Force Contact
Center before making firm plans.</span></p>

<p><span>15.18.1.<b>&nbsp;Place of Retirement.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In
general, a member may retire in the continental United States. Members assigned
to a duty station in the continental United States retire at the duty station.
If the member is overseas, the member and family can proceed to the final
continental United States home of selection. If the member elects to retire
overseas and live permanently in that country, he or she must comply with
command and host government residency rules before the date of retirement.</span></p>

<p><span>15.18.2.&nbsp;<b>Retired Pay.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The date initially
entered military service normally determines which of the existing retirement
pay plans applies to a member. Date initially entered military service<b>&nbsp;</b>is
the date an individual was initially enlisted, inducted, or appointed in a
regular or reserve component of a uniformed service as a commissioned officer,
warrant officer, or enlisted member. The date initially entered military service
is a fixed date that is not subject to adjustment because of a break in
service. Current active military personnel will fall under one of the
retirement plans described in Table 15.1.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.19.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Survivor Benefit Plan:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.19.1.
Military pay stops when a member dies. Established by Congress on 21 September
1972, the survivor benefit plan provides a monthly income to survivors of
retired military personnel upon the member's death. The survivor benefit plan
is a government program for retiring members to ensure their eligible survivors
receive a portion of their military retired pay in the form of a monthly
annuity after their death. The plan was structured so a surviving spouse cannot
outlive the annuity, and cost-of-living adjustments are incorporated to offset
inflation. Regular Air Force members with a spouse or dependent children are
automatically covered by the survivor benefit plan at no cost while they remain
on Regular Air Force. The member's death must be classified in line of duty in
order for an annuity to be payable if the member is not yet retirement eligible
(has not accrued 20 years of Regular Air Force) on the date of death. The
annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been
entitled to receive if retired with a total disability rating on the date of
death. An annuity may also be payable if the member's death is classified not
in line of duty, as long as the member was retirement eligible on the date of
death. In this case, annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the
member would have been entitled to receive if retired for years of service on
the date of death. The surviving spouse of a member who dies in the line of
duty while on Regular Air Force may request the survivor benefit plan be paid
only to the member's children, avoiding the reduction caused by a spouse s
receipt of dependency and indemnity compensation, the survivor benefits paid by
the Department of Veteran Affairs when a member's death is determined to have
resulted from a serviceconnected cause.</span></p>

<p><span>15.19.2. The survivor benefit
plan is the only program that enables a portion of military retired pay to be
paid to a member's survivors. Prior to retiring, each member must decide
whether to continue survivor benefit plan coverage into retirement.</span></p>

<p><span>If
electing coverage, survivor benefit plan premiums are assessed and
automatically deducted from the member's monthly retired pay. Premiums are
government-subsidized and deducted from a participating member's retired pay
before taxes.&nbsp; 15.19.3. Survivor benefit plan premiums and beneficiary
annuity payments depend on what is called the  base amount  elected as the
basis of coverage. A service member's base amount can be the full monthly
retired pay or a portion of retired pay, down to $300. Full coverage means
full-retired pay is elected as the base amount. The base amount is tied to a
member's retired pay; therefore, when retired pay receives cost-of-living
adjustments, so does the base amount, and as a result, so do premiums and the
annuity payments.</span></p>

<p><span>15.19.4. Generally the
survivor benefit plan is an irrevocable decision. However, under limited
circumstances, you may withdraw from the survivor benefit plan (Figure 15.1) or
change your coverage. As a survivor benefit plan participant, you have a 1-year
window to terminate survivor benefit plan coverage between the second and third
anniversary following the date you begin to receive retired pay. The premiums
you paid will not be refunded, and an annuity will not be payable upon your
death. Your covered spouse or former spouse must consent to the withdrawal.
Termination is permanent, and participation may not be resumed under any
circumstance barring future enrollment. The survivor benefit plan also has a
 paid-up  feature that permits members who have attained age 70 and who have
paid survivor benefit plan premiums for 360 months to stop paying premiums but
remain active participants in the plan. Additional information can be attained
through the local military personnel section office or the Airman and Family
Readiness Center.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 15.1. Stop Coverage.</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.21.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>American Red Cross.</b></span></p>

<p><span>American
Red Cross services to the Armed Forces program provide support to service
members and their families in times of crisis. While serving 1.4 million
Regular Air Force personnel and their immediate family members, the American
Red Cross also reaches out to the 1.2 million members of the National Guard and
Reserve and their immediate family members who reside in nearly every community
in the United States and territories of the United States. The core service is
emergency communication messages. All American Red Cross services to military
members and their families are provided free of charge 365 days a year, 24
hours a day. The American Red Cross assists Regular Air Force personnel,
National Guard members, Reservists, Reserve Officer Training Corps, United
States Army Corps of Engineers, United States Coast Guard, United States Public
Health Service, and veterans. See Figure 15.2 for services available to
inactive and active service members.</span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Emergency Communication Services</span></u></b></p>

<p><span>When a military family experiences a crisis, the American Red
Cross is there to assist by providing emergency communications 24 hours a day,
365 days a year. The American Red Cross relays urgent messages containing
accurate, factual, complete and verified descriptions of the emergency to
service members stationed anywhere in the world, including ships at sea,
embassies and remote locations. American Red Cross emergency communications
services keep military personnel in touch with their families following the
death or serious illness of an immediate family member, the birth of a service
member's child or grandchild or when a family experiences other emergencies.</span></p>

<p><span>No matter where a military member and their family are stationed,
they can rest assured the American Red Cross will deliver their notifications
in times of crisis. Even if the service member receives notification of an
emergency through an e-mail or a phone call, American Red Cross-verified
information assists commanding officers in making a decision regarding
emergency leave. Without this verification, the service member may not be able
to come home during a family emergency.</span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Financial Assistance</span></u></b></p>

<p><span>The American Red Cross works under partnership agreements with the
Air Force Aid Society, Army Emergency Relief, Coast Guard Mutual Assistance,
and Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society to provide quality, reliable financial
assistance to eligible applicant's 24-hours/7-days a week/365 days a year.
Types of assistance include financial assistance for emergency travel, burial
of a loved one, assistance to avoid privation, etc.</span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Coping with Deployments</span></u></b></p>

<p><span>Psychological First Aid for Military Families was developed out of
the American Red Cross's continuing commitment to serve military families. This
course was designed specifically for the spouses, parents, siblings, and
significant others of service members. This Red Cross service provides useful
information on how to strengthen your ability to successfully respond to the
challenges that military family members may encounter throughout the deployment
cycle. It also explains how to provide psychological first aid to others
experiencing stressful feelings or events.</span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Reconnection Workshops</span></u></b></p>

<p><span>Reintegration support that provides materials focusing on Working
Through Anger, Communicating Clearly, Exploring Stress and Trauma, Relating to
Children and Identifying Depression. The workshops focus on individuals and
small groups and are designed to help family members reconnect and service
members reintegrate successfully. Led by licensed, specifically trained Red
Cross mental health workers, each session addresses a topic military families
have found relevant to the reunion adjustment.</span></p>

<p><b><u><span>Veterans Claims for Benefits</span></u></b></p>

<p><span>The American Red Cross provides assistance and information in
preparing, developing, and obtaining sufficient evidence to support applicants 
claims for veterans' benefits and also assists claimants who seek to appeal to
the Board of Veterans' Appeals.</span></p>

<h2><u><span>Information and Referral Services</span></u></h2>

<p><span>The American Red Cross offers confidential
services to all military personnel Regular, National Guard and Reserve, and
their families. Counseling, guidance, information, referrals and other social
services are available through our worldwide network of chapters and offices on
military installations. American Red Cross chapters are listed in local
telephone books and at your local American Red Cross. As more and more National
Guard and Reserve units are called to full-time duty status, counseling has
become increasingly important to prepare the civilian-based military members
and their families for the period of activation. Because members of the
National Guard and Reserve typically live in civilian neighborhoods, they and
their families frequently have difficulty accessing much-needed,
military-related social services.</span></p>

Records and Individual Rights</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.22. Personal Information File:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.22.1. Commanders
and supervisors perform many personnel management functions requiring them to
keep files on assigned personnel. AFI 36-2608,&nbsp;<i>Military Personnel
Records System,</i>&nbsp;authorizes the use and maintenance of the commander s
or supervisor's personal information files. Unit commanders or equivalents
maintain discretion to create personal information files on all assigned
personnel, but personal information files are mandatory for officer personnel
who receive a letter of admonishment or a letter of counseling. If a personal
information file is established, use of Air Force Form 10A,&nbsp;<i>Personnel
Information File, Record of Performance, Officer Command Selection Record Group</i>,
is required. Contents are governed by AFI 36-2608. Custodians must keep the
personal information files current and secured in a locked area or container to
protect against misuse or unauthorized access.</span></p>

<p><span>15.22.2. According
to the Privacy Act of 1974, a person who is the subject of the record may
request access to this record at any time. Individuals have the right to review
their personal information file at any time and challenge or question the need
for documents in the file. The contents are available to commanders, raters,
first sergeants, senior raters, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, and
staff judge advocate personnel as warranted. The release and review of the
personal information file contents in these instances are for  official
business' or  routine use  according to AFI 33-332,&nbsp;<i>Air Force</i>&nbsp;<i>Privacy

<p><b><span>15.23. The Privacy Act:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.23.1. The
Privacy Act of 1974 as amended&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm"><span><span>(</span></span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm"><span><span>http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact</span></span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm"><span><span>-</span></span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm"><span><span>overview.htm</span></span></a><a href="http://www.justice.gov/opcl/1974privacyact-overview.htm"><span><span>)</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;establishes a code of fair
information practices that govern the collection, maintenance, use, and
dissemination of personal information about individuals that is maintained in
systems of records by federal agencies. Privacy Act System of Records is
defined in the Act as  a group of any records under the control of any agency
from which information is retrieved by the individual's name, number, or unique
identifier . Individual is defined in the Act as  a citizen of the United
States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.  Privacy Act
rights are personal to the individual who is the subject of the record and
cannot be asserted derivatively by others. Note, however, the parent of any
minor, or the legal guardian of an incompetent, may act on behalf of that
individual. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a
system of records absent the written consent of the subject individual.</span></p>

<p><span>15.23.2. The
Privacy Act limits the collection of information to what the law or Executive
Orders authorize. System of Records Notices must be published in the Federal
Register allowing the public a 30-day comment period. Such collection must not
conflict with the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution. A Privacy Act statement must be given when individuals are asked
to provide personal information about themselves for collection in a system of
records.</span></p>

<p><span>15.23.3. In
addition to specifying disclosure procedures, the Privacy Act governs the
maintenance of systems of records. The Act provides individuals with a means by
which to seek access to and amend their records and sets forth agency record-keeping
requirements. Individuals have the right to request access or amendment to
their records in a system. Personally identifiable information in a system of
records must be safeguarded to ensure  an official need to know  access of the
records and to avoid actions that could result in harm, embarrassment, or
unfairness to the individual. The law limits the uses of records to the
purposes that are stated in the System of Records Notices, as published in the
Federal Register. System of Records Notices for Air Force records systems can
be found at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx"><span><span>http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx</span></span></a><a href="http://dpcld.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx"><span><span>.</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;Department of Defense personnel may
disclose records to other offices in the Department of Defense when there is
 an official need to know  and to other federal government agencies or
individuals when a discloser of record is a  routine use  published in the
System of Records Notices or as authorized by a Privacy Act exception. In
addition, information may be released for a disclosed specified purpose with
the subject's consent. The Office of Primary Responsibility of the data should
keep an account of all information they ve released.</span></p>

<p><span>15.23.4. For further
information, definitions, exemptions, exceptions, or responsibilities and
procedures for safeguarding and reporting of personally identifiable
information breaches, consult AFI 33-332,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Privacy and Civil
Liberties Program</i>. The Office of Management and Budget defines a personally
identifiable information breach as,  A loss of control, compromise,
unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any
similar term referring to situations where persons other than authorized users
and for an other than authorized purpose have access or potential access to
personally identifiable information, whether physical or electronic. </span></p>

<p><b><span>15.24. Freedom of Information Act.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Freedom of
Information Act provides access to federal agency records (or parts of these
records) except those protected from release by nine specific exemptions.
Freedom of Information Act requests are written requests that cite or imply the
Freedom of Information Act. The law establishes rigid time limits for replying
to requesters and permits assessing fees in certain instances. The Freedom of
Information Act imposes mandatory time limits of 20 workdays to either deny the
request or release the requested records. The law permits an additional
10-workday extension in unusual circumstances specifically outlined in the
Freedom of Information Act. (<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Denials require notification of
appeal rights. Requester can file an appeal or litigate.) Refer to Air Force
Manual 33-302,<i>&nbsp;Freedom of Information Act Program</i>, for specific
policy and procedures on the Freedom of Information Act and for guidance on
disclosing records to the public.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.25. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.25.1. The Air
Force Board for Correction of Military Records is the highest level of
administrative review and powerful, yet simple system for correcting military
records. Unless procured by fraud, their decision is final and binding on all
Air Force officials and government agencies. The Air Force Board for Correction
of Military Record's authority, jurisdiction, and policy are explained in AFI
36-2603,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records</i>. Air
Force Pamphlet 362607,&nbsp;<i>Applicants' Guide to the Air Force Board for
Correction of Military Records</i>, contains additional information.</span></p>

<p><span>15.25.2. With few
exceptions, most records generated by the Air Force may be corrected by the Air
Force Board for Correction of Military Records; however, an applicant must
exhaust other reasonably available administrative avenues of relief prior to
applying to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. For
instance, Enlisted Performance Reports may be voided, upgraded, or rewritten;
discharges and reenlistment/reentry eligibility codes may be upgraded; survivor
benefit plan elections may be changed; leave may be credited; Article 15
actions may be voided; reinstatement into the Air Force may be achieved, etc.
Records may be changed, voided, or created as necessary to correct an error or
to remove an injustice, and applicable monetary benefits are recomputed based
on the records changed. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records
cannot, however, change the verdict of a courts-martial imposed after 5 May
1950 but may, on the basis of clemency, change the punishment imposed by the
final reviewing authority.</span></p>

<p><span>15.25.3.
Because the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is the highest
level of administrative appeal in the Air Force, Applicants must first exhaust
other administrative remedies before applying to the Air Force Board for
Correction of Military Records. Otherwise their application (DD Form 149,&nbsp;<i>Application
for Correction of Military Record</i></span></p>

<p><i><span>Under the Provisions of
Title 10, United States Code, Section 1552</span></i><span>) will be returned without action. For example, Enlisted</span></p>

<p><span>Performance Report
appeals must first be submitted through Evaluation Reports Appeal Board, under
the provisions of AFI 36-2401,&nbsp;<i>Correcting Officer and Enlisted
Evaluation Reports</i>. Applicants should consult AFPAM 36-2607 and or consult
with their Force Support Squadron to determine which administrative avenues of
relief are available to them depending on the nature of the correction sought.</span></p>

<p><span>15.25.4.
Application to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is a
simple process. However, favorable consideration of the application depends on
all the facts and circumstances of the case and how well the request is
supported by documentary evidence. The Air Force Board for Correction of
Military Records is not an investigative body and except in those rare cases
where a personal appearance is granted and testimony is taken, and the decision
is based on the evidence contained in the case file. This normally consists of
the applicant's submission (e.g. statements, arguments, documentary evidence, etc.),
military record, and advisory opinion(s) from the Air Force office of primary
responsibility. There is a presumption of regularity on the part of the
government and absent evidence to the contrary is assumed that all government
officials exercised their duties in accordance with law and policy. Because of
this, the applicant bears the burden of providing sufficient evidence to
establish the existence of an error or an injustice in record. The type and
extent of evidence necessary to support the case depends on the nature of the
request.</span></p>

<p><span>15.25.5. Cases are
reviewed in executive session by a panel of three members, randomly selected
from the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records membership. These
members, General Schedule-15s and above, the majority of whom are members of
the Senior Executive Service cadre, are appointed from the executive part of
the department and serve at the discretion of the Secretary. However, service
on the board is a collateral, volunteer duty. Applicants may request a personal
appearance before the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records;
however, a personal appearance is not a statutory right and is granted solely
at the discretion of the Board, predicated on the finding the applicant s
presence, without or without counsel, will materially add to the Board s
understanding of the issue(s) involved. Few personal appearances are granted
and the decision to conduct such a hearing is made at the time the Board
initially adjudicates the application. During deliberations, which are
conducted in Executive Session, Board members decide whether the applicant has
first exhausted all available avenues of administrative relief; whether the
application has been timely filed and if not, whether the failure to do so
should be waived in the interest of justice; whether the provisions of Title
10, United States Code, Section 1034 apply to the case, and whether an error or
an injustice exists. The Board is a recommending body on all cases and will
vote to grant, partially grant, and deny the requested relief. If the board
recommends favorable relief, the case is forwarded to the Secretary of the Air
Force's designee for final decision. Applicants have the right to request
reconsideration of the Board's decision; however, reconsideration is granted
only if the applicant can provide newly discovered relevant evidence that was
not reasonably available when the original application was submitted.</span></p>

<p><span>15.25.6.
Applications formally considered by the Air Force Board for Correction of Military
Records are processed within 10 to 18 months. Title 10, United States Code,
Section 1557,&nbsp;<i>Timeliness Standards for Disposition of Applications
Before Corrections Boards,</i>&nbsp;provides oversight and clearance deadlines
for the correction of military records review and decision.</span></p>

<p><span>After fiscal year
2010, 90 percent of the cases must be completed within 10 months.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.26. Air Force Discharge Review Board:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.26.1. The Air
Force Discharge Review Board affords former Air Force members the opportunity
to request review of their discharge (except for a discharge or dismissal by
general court-martial). The objective of a discharge review is to examine an
applicant's administrative discharge and to change the characterization of
service, the reason for discharge, and the re-enlistment code (when
applicable), based on standards of propriety or equity. Bad conduct discharges,
given as a result of a special court-martial, may be upgraded on clemency
factors.</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.2. A personal
appearance before the Air Force Discharge Review Board is a statutory right.
The applicant or the applicant's counsel may appear before the board in
Washington District of Columbia (Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility
Washington, Maryland) or at a regional location. The Board conducts regional boards
via video teleconference.&nbsp; The application can also be considered on a
record review basis prior to a request for personal appearance, whereupon the
board will review the case based on documentation in the military record and
any additional evidence provided by the applicant. The Air Force Discharge
Review Board procedures allow the applicant latitude in presenting evidence,
witnesses, and testimony in support of the applicant's case.</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3. Airmen
separated under circumstances (except retirement) that make them ineligible for
reenlistment and officers discharged under adverse conditions are briefed by
the Military Personnel Section at the time of their discharge about the Air
Force Discharge Review Board process. They are provided with a discharge review
fact sheet and an application (DD Form 293,&nbsp;<i>Application for the Review
of Discharge from the Armed Forces of the United States</i>).</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3.1. No
minimum waiting period is required to submit an application.</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3.2. No
provisions exist to automatically upgrade a discharge.</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3.3. The
military will not pay travel expenses to Air Force Discharge Review Board
hearing sites.</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3.4. The
military will not bear the cost of private counsel.</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3.4.1.
Members may engage counsel at their own expense; however, a number of
organizations provide counsel at no cost or a representative to assist
applicants. These include national service organizations such as the American
Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3.5. There is
a Department of Defense Electronic Reading Room for the Military Departments
Boards for the Corrections of Military/Naval Records and the Discharge Review
Boards. The Reading Room contains the decisional documents for each of the
Boards from October 1998. The personally identifiable information has been

<p><span>15.26.3.6. Former
Members with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury. In the
case of a former member of the armed forces who, while serving on Regular Air
Force as a member of the armed forces, was deployed in support of a contingency
operation and who, at any time after such deployment, was diagnosed by a
physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist as experiencing
post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury as a consequence of
that deployment, a board established under this section to review the former
member's discharge or dismissal shall include a member who is a clinical
psychologist or psychiatrist, or a physician with training on mental health
issues connected with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury
(as applicable).</span></p>

<p><span>15.26.3.7. Former
Members with Mental Health Diagnoses. In the case of a former member of the
armed forces who was diagnosed while serving in the armed forces as
experiencing a mental health disorder, a board established under this section
to review the former member's discharge or dismissal shall include a member who
is a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist, or a physician with special
training on mental health disorders.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.1.&nbsp;<b>Service and Campaign Awards.</b></span></p>

<p><span>These awards
recognize members for honorable active military service for participation in a
campaign, period of war, national emergency, expedition, or a specified
significant peacetime military operation. They also recognize individuals who
participate in specific or significant military operations and who participate
in specific types of service while serving on Regular Air Force or as a member
of the Reserve forces. Individuals should keep copies of their temporary duty
and permanent change of station orders and travel vouchers to help prove
entitlement to service and campaign awards. Additional service and campaign
awards can be found in AFI 36-2803,&nbsp;<i>The Air Force Awards and
Decorations Program or on the Air Force  myPers' website</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Global
War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service
Medal.</b>&nbsp;Two of the most common service awards worn by Air Force members
today are the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on
Terrorism Service Medal. They were established on 12 March 2003.</span></p>

<p><span>The Global War on
Terrorism Expeditionary Medal is awarded to members who deployed on or after 11
September 2001 for service in Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM, or
NEW DAWN. The Global War on Terrorism Service Medal is awarded to members who
participated in the Global War on Terrorism operations outside of the
designated area of eligibility for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary
Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal, on or after 11
September 2001 and a date to be determined.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Afghanistan
Campaign Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.</b>&nbsp;Two other service medals
being issued are the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal. The
Afghanistan Campaign Medal and Iraq Campaign Medal were established on 29
November 2004 and recognize service members who serve or have served in the
respective countries in support of Operations ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM,
or NEW DAWN. Effective 1 May 2005, members deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq
receive the respective campaign medal in lieu of the Global War on Terrorism
Expeditionary Medal. Campaign stars are worn on the ribbons to designate official
campaign periods as established by the Department of Defense.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>An Arrowhead Device is authorized to denote
participation in a combat parachute jump, helicopter assault landing, combat
glider landing, or amphibious assault landing, while assigned or attached as a
member of an organized force carrying out an assigned tactical mission.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Korea
Defense Service Medal.&nbsp;</b>In February 2004, Department of Defense
approved the Korea Defense Service Medal for Regular Air Force, Air Force
Reserve, and Air National Guard personnel as recognition for military service
in the Republic of Korea and the surrounding waters after 28 July 1954 and a
future date to be determined.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.1.4.&nbsp;<b>Humanitarian
Service Medal.</b>&nbsp;The Humanitarian Service Medal<b>&nbsp;</b>is awarded
to members of the United States Armed Forces and their Reserve components who,
after 1 April 1975, distinguished themselves as individuals or members of
United States military units or ships by meritorious direct participation in a
significant military act or operation of humanitarian nature.  Direct
participation  is any member assigned directly to the humanitarian operation
providing hands-on participation. A bronze service star denotes subsequent
awards. A listing of approved operations for the Humanitarian Service Medal are
identified in DoDM 1348.33,&nbsp;<i>Manual of Military Decorations and Awards</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.2.&nbsp;<b>Unit Awards.</b></span></p>

<p><span>These awards are
presented to United States military units that distinguish themselves during
peacetime or in action against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the United
States. To preserve the integrity of unit awards, they are approved only to
recognize acts or services that are clearly and distinctly outstanding by
nature and magnitude</span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>The
acts or services recognized must place the unit's performance above that of
other units similar in composition and mission and be of such importance that
they cannot be appropriately recognized in any other way. Only one unit award
is awarded for the same achievement or service. The unit's entire service must
have been honorable during the distinguished act. An organization may display
the award elements of a unit award. Designated subordinate units of the
organization may also share in the award; however, higher organizations may
not. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a period for
which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they
directly contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the unit. Questions
concerning eligibility to wear a specific unit award may be directed to the
local military personnel section. The five most common unit awards worn by Air
Force members today are Gallant Unit Citation, the Meritorious Unit Award, the
Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence
Award, and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Gallant
Unit Citation.</b>&nbsp;The Gallant Unit Citation was approved by the Secretary
of the Air Force in March 2004 and is awarded to Air Force units for
extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States
while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing
foreign force on or after 11 September 2001. The unit must have performed with
marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing
its mission so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in
the same conflict. The Gallant Unit Citation will normally be earned by units
that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively
brief time spans.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Meritorious
Unit Award.</b>&nbsp;The Meritorious Unit Award was also approved by the
Secretary of the Air Force in March 2004 and is awarded to Air Force units for
exceptionally meritorious conduct in performance of outstanding achievement or
service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days
during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the United
States on or after 11 September 2001. Superior performance of normal mission
alone will not justify award of the Meritorious Unit Award. Service in a combat
zone is not required, but service must be directly related to the combat
effort. The Meritorious Unit Award is not awarded to any unit or unit component
previously awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, Air Force
Organizational Excellence Award, or unit awards from other Service components
for the same act, achievement, or service.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force Outstanding Unit Award.</b>&nbsp;The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award was
established and awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force 6 Jan
1954. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award is awarded only to numbered units or
numbered Air Forces, air divisions, wings, groups, and squadrons. To be awarded
the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, an organization must have performed
meritorious service or outstanding achievements that clearly set the unit above
and apart from similar units. Commanders must annually review the
accomplishments of their eligible subordinate units and recommend only those
units that are truly exceptional. Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to
a command are recommended annually. Commanders send Air Force Outstanding Unit
Award recommendations to their major commands for consideration. Certain
recommendations for the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award are exempt from annual
submission. These are recommendations for specific achievements, combat
operations, or conflict with hostile forces.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force Organizational Excellence Award.</b>&nbsp;The Air Force Organizational
Excellence Award was established and awarded in the name of the Secretary of
the Air Force 6 Jan 1954.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>The Air Force Organizational Excellence Award has the same
guidelines and approval authority as the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The
Air Force Organizational Excellence Award is awarded to unnumbered
organizations such as a major command headquarters, a field operating agency, a
direct reporting unit, the Office of the Chief of Staff, and other Air Staff
and deputy assistant chief of staff agencies.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Only 10 percent of similar units assigned
to a command are recommended annually.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Joint
Meritorious Unit Award.&nbsp;</b>The Joint Meritorious Unit Award was
established 4 June 1981 and is awarded in the name of the Secretary of Defense
to recognize joint units and activities such as a joint task force for
meritorious achievement or service superior to that normally expected. Air
Force members assigned or attached to the joint unit or joint task force
awarded a Joint Meritorious Unit Award may be eligible to wear the Joint
Meritorious Unit Award ribbon.</span></p>



<p><span>15.29.3.&nbsp;<b>Achievement Awards.</b></span></p>

<p><span>These awards
recognize members for achieving or meeting specific types of pre-established
criteria or requirements of qualification, service, performance, or conduct.
Air Force members must meet specific eligibility requirements and criteria. The
Military Personnel Section determines and verifies eligibility for the various
types of achievement awards and makes the appropriate entry into personnel
records. The military personnel section also procures and provides the initial
issue of all achievement medals and ribbons. Additional achievement awards can
be found in AFI 36-2803.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force Longevity Service Award.</b>&nbsp;The Air Force presents the Air Force
Longevity Service Award every 4 years to members who complete honorable active
Federal military service.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force Overseas Ribbon.&nbsp;</b>The Air Force awards these ribbons to
individuals who have completed an overseas (long or short) tour.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force Training Ribbon.&nbsp;</b>The Air Force awards this ribbon to members who
have completed an Air</span></p>

<p><span>Force accession
training program (since 14 August 1974), such as basic military training,
officer training school, Reserve Officer Training Corps, United States Air
Force Academy, or Medical Services, Judge Advocate, or Chaplain orientation.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.4.&nbsp;<b>Special Trophies and Awards.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force also
sponsors various special trophies and awards programs. Special trophies and
awards are unique in that the commanders of major commands, field operating
agencies, and direct reporting units must nominate individuals to compete for
these awards. In most cases, commanders submit nominations annually. The
competition among the nominees is keen. The commander's nomination alone serves
as a meaningful recognition because nomination places the individual in
competition with the best in the Air Force or the Nation. Some examples of
special trophies and awards are the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year Award and
the Lance P. Sijan Award. AFI 36-2805<i>,</i>&nbsp;<i>Special Trophies and
Awards</i>, lists various special trophies and awards programs.</span></p>

<p><span>15.29.5.&nbsp;<b>Foreign Decorations.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The policy of the
Department of Defense is that awards from foreign governments may be accepted
only in recognition of active combat service or for outstanding or unusually
meritorious performance only upon receiving the approval of Department of the
Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.30.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Decorations:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.30.1.&nbsp;<b>What Is a Decoration?</b></span></p>

<p><span>Formal recognition
for personal excellence that requires individual nomination and Air Force or
Department of Defense approval. Decorations are awarded in recognition for acts
of valor, heroism, courage, exceptional service, meritorious service, or
outstanding achievement that clearly place members above their peers and be of
such importance that the person cannot receive proper recognition in any other
way. When an individual is being considered for a decoration, the determining
factors are level of responsibility, achievements, accomplishments, manner of
performance, and the impact of the accomplishment. Each decoration has specific
performance requirements for award, and an individual may receive only one
decoration for any act, achievement, or period of service. Specific criteria
for each decoration are in AFI 36-2803.</span></p>

<p><span>15.30.2.&nbsp;<b>Recommending an Individual for a Decoration.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Any person, other
than the individual being recommended, having firsthand knowledge of the act,
achievement, or service may recommend or contribute to a decoration
recommendation by providing evidence or statements through the supervisor and
chain of command of the member being recommended. However, this obligation
primarily falls on the immediate supervisor. The three most common decorations
are the Air Force Achievement Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, and the
Meritorious Service Medal. Every unit, wing, and major command has specific
submission criteria and procedures for these three decorations. For specific
guidance, contact your commander support staff or the force management section
at the local force support squadron or military personnel section.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 15H Airman
Promotion System</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.31. Objective.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The enlisted
promotion system supports Department of Defense directive 1304.20,&nbsp;<i>Enlisted
Personnel Management System (EPMS),</i>&nbsp;by helping to provide a visible,
relatively stable career progression opportunity over the long term;
attracting, retaining, and motivating to career service, the kinds and numbers
of people the military services need; and ensuring a reasonably uniform application
of the principle of equal pay for equal work among the military services. This
section addresses the program elements of the Regular Air Force Airman.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.32. Promotion Quotas.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Promotion quotas
for the top five grades (Staff Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant) are tied
to fiscal-end strength and are affected by funding limits, regulatory limits,
and the number of projected vacancies in specific grades. The Department of Defense
limits the number of Airmen the Air Force may have in the top five grades.
Public law (Title 10, United States Code, Section 517) limits the number of
Airmen who may serve in the Regular Air Force in the top two enlisted grades.
The authorized daily average of enlisted members on Regular Air Force (other
than for training) in pay grades E-8 and E9 in a fiscal year may not be more
than 2.5 percent and 1.25, respectively.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.33. Promotion Cycles and General Eligibility Requirements.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force
establishes promotion cycles to ensure timely periodic promotions and to permit
more accurate forecasting of vacancies. Promotion cycles also balance the
promotion administrative workload and provide cutoff dates for eligibility. The
basis for promotion eligibility is proper skill level, sufficient time in
grade, sufficient time in service, and a recommendation by the immediate
commander. Table 15.2 lists time in service, time in grade, and significant
dates of promotion. Table 15.3 lists minimum eligibility requirements for each
grade.</span></p>

Promotion Eligibility Cutoff Dates, and Test Cycles for Promotion to Airman
through Chief Master Sergeant.</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.34. Promotion Ineligibility.</span></b></p>

<p><span>There are many
reasons why an Airman may be considered ineligible for promotion, such as
approved retirement, declination for extension or reenlistment, court-martial
conviction, control roster action, not recommended by the commander, failure to
appear for scheduled testing without a valid reason, absent without leave, etc.
When individuals are ineligible for promotion, they cannot test; cannot be
considered if already tested; and the projected promotion, if already selected,
will be canceled.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.35. Promotion Sequence Numbers.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force
Personnel Center assigns promotion sequence numbers to Airmen selected for
promotion to Staff Sergeants through Chief Master Sergeant based on date of
rank, total active federal military service date, and date of birth.
Supplemental selectees are assigned promotion sequence numbers of .9 (increment
previously announced) or .5 (unannounced future increment).</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.36. Accepting Promotion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airmen who accept a
promotion are eligible for reassignment and selective retraining in the
projected grade.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Selectees
to the grade of Master Sergeant and Senior Master Sergeant will incur a 2-year
Regular Air Force service commitment from the effective date of promotion. In
addition, members with 18 or more years of total active federal military
service will be required to obtain 2-years retainability to serve the 2-year
Regular Air Force service commitment. Selectees to the grade of Chief Master
Sergeant will incur a 3-year Regular Air Force service commitment from the effective
date of promotion and will be required to obtain 3-years retainability
(regardless of total active federal military service) to serve the 3-year
Regular Air Force service commitment. Within 10 workdays after selection for
promotion you are required to accept or decline the promotion.</span></p>

retirement in place of total active federal military service date to determine
promotion eligibility for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Airmen
ordered to Regular Air Force under 12301(a).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>4.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Airman First Class must meet skill
level requirements by the effective date of promotion for Senior Airman Senior
Airman must meet skill level requirements by the promotion eligibility cutoff
date for Staff Sergeant Staff Sergeants test and compete for promotion to
Technical Sergeant if they have a 5-skill level as of promotion eligibility
cutoff date; however, they must have a&nbsp; 7-skill level before
promotion Master Sergeants and Senior Master Sergeants must meet minimum
skill-level requirements listed above. In some case, commanders may waiver this
to allow them to compete for promotion Airmen demoted to Senior Airman, Staff
Sergeant, or Technical Sergeant will not have their high year of tenure
adjusted to make them eligible to compete for promotion. Airmen who are demoted
past their high year of tenure for that grade will not be afforded an
opportunity to promotion test If demoted an Airman's high year of tenure will
be established in accordance with AFI 36-3208.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>5.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Service in a commissioned, warrant,
or flight officer status is creditable for pay. Such service does not count for
this requirement (38 Comptroller General 598). Airmen may be considered for
promotion who meet this requirement on the first day of the last month
promotions are normally made in the cycle. Actual promotion does not occur earlier
than the first day of the month following the month the Airman completes the
required enlisted service. This applies if the select had a sequence number in
an earlier promotion increment; however, if the Airman meets the required
enlisted service on the first day of the month, the date of rank and effective
date is that date.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>6.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>If a temporary duty student meets the
requirements of this table but does not maintain satisfactory proficiency, the
military personnel section that services the Airman's temporary duty unit
informs the military personnel section servicing the Airman's unit of
assignment.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>7.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>To satisfy promotion eligibility
requirements, enlisted professional military education will be completed by
in-residence for promotion to Staff Sergeant and by correspondence for
promotion to Senior Master Sergeant. All professional military education may be
completed in-residence or by correspondence. If selected, the projected
promotion will be placed into withhold, if the 12month Enlisted Professional Military
Education Policy enrollment expires before the promotion sequence number
consummates.&nbsp; The promotion sequence number will be removed if Enlisted
Professional Military Education Policy is not completed by the end of the
promotion cycle.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>8.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Completion of the United States Army

<p><span><b><span>15.37.</span></b></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Declining Promotion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airmen may decline
a promotion in writing any time prior to the effective date. The declination
letter must include name, social security number, promotion cycle, promotion
sequence number (if already selected), and a statement of understanding that
reinstatement will not be authorized.</span></p>

<p><span><b><span>15.38.</span></b></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Enlisted Professional Military Education
Completion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airmen who fail to
complete Phase 2 and/or Phase 3 enlisted PME distance learning prior to the
established suspense are considered ineligible for promotion. Airmen selected
for promotion to Staff Sergeant must complete in-resident enlisted professional
military education (Airman Leadership School) before assuming the rank of Staff
Sergeant unless the member is granted an enlisted professional military education
waiver. There is no PME requirement to sew on Technical Sergeant or Master
Sergeant; however, the Airman must not have a Promotion Eligibility States code
2 for failure to complete Phase 2 or 3 distance learning by the suspense date.
If they have a Promotion Eligibility code 2 on or after promotion eligibility
cut-off date they are ineligible for the cycle.&nbsp; Airmen pending promotion
consideration to the rank of Senior Master Sergeant must complete Phase 3
Senior NCO Academy or equivalent/sister service/international enlisted
professional military education (correspondence or in-residence) on or before
the promotion eligibility cut-off date to remain eligible for promotion. In the
case that an Airman has a promotion sequence number and has not completed their
required distance learning by the suspense date, he or she will be placed into
a promotion withhold status. The withhold status will be removed upon course
completion or it will expire at the end of the promotion cycle where the line
number will be cancelled.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span><b><span>15.39.</span></b></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Promotion by Grade:</span></b></p>

<p><span><span>15.39.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Airman and Airman First Class.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force
normally promotes eligible Airmen recommended by their commander on a
noncompetitive basis. An Airman Basic must have 6 months of time in grade to be
eligible for promotion to Airman. The time in grade requirement for an Airman
to be eligible for promotion to Airman First Class is 10 months. There are
different phase points for individuals graduating from basic military training
as Airman or Airman First Class that correspond with their earlier promotions.
Individuals initially enlisting for a period of 6 years are promoted from
Airman Basic or Airman to Airman First Class upon completion of either
technical training, or 20 weeks of technical training (start date of the
20-week period is the date of basic military training completion), whichever
occurs first.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.39.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Senior Airman.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force
promotes Airman First Class to Senior Airman with either 36 months of time in
service and 20 months of time in grade or 28 months of time in grade, whichever
occurs first. They must possess a 3-skill level and be recommended by their
unit commander. Airman First Class may compete for early advancement to Senior
Airman if they meet the minimum eligibility criteria outlined in the
aforementioned Table 15.3. If promoted to Senior Airman below the zone, their
promotion effective date would be 6 months before their fully qualified date.
Individuals are considered in the month (December, March, June, or September)
before the quarter (January through March, April through June, July through
September, or October through December) they are eligible for below the zone
promotion.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.39.3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Staff Sergeant and Technical Sergeant.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Promotion to the
grades of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant occurs under one of two
programs: the Weighted Airman Promotion System or Stripes for Exceptional
Performers.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.39.3.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Weighted Airman Promotion System.</span></b><span>&nbsp;Airmen compete and test under
Weighted Airman Promotion System in their control Air Force specialty code held
on the promotion eligibility cutoff date. The Weighted Airman Promotion System
consists of up to four weighted factors: specialty knowledge test, promotion
fitness examination, decorations, and enlisted performance reports. Each of
these factors is  weighted  or assigned points based on its importance relative
to promotion. The promotion fitness examination and specialty knowledge test
account for 200 points. The promotion fitness examination contains a wide range
of Air Force knowledge, while the specialty knowledge test covers Air Force
specialty code broad technical knowledge. Table 15.4 shows how to calculate
points. The Air Force makes promotions under Weighted Airman Promotion System
within each Air Force specialty code, not across them. This means those
eligible compete for promotion only with those individuals currently working in
their Air Force specialty code. Selectees are individuals with the highest
scores in each Air Force specialty code, within the quota limitations. If more
than one individual has the same total score at the cutoff point, the Air Force
promotes everyone with that score.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.39.3.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The Stripes for Exceptional
Performers Program, established in 1980, is designed to meet those unique
circumstances that, in the commander's judgment, clearly warrant promotion.
Under Stripes for Exceptional Performers, commanders of major commands and
field operating agencies and senior officers in organizations with large enlisted
populations may promote a limited number of Airmen with exceptional potential
to the grades of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant (each major command
determines their own procedures and Stripes for Exceptional Performers
selection levels). The commander must ensure personnel who are promoted meet
eligibility requirements including completion of the appropriate enlisted
professional military education. An individual may not receive more than one
promotion under any combination of promotion programs within a 12-month period.
(<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;A Senior Airman must serve 6 months of time in grade
before being promoted to Staff Sergeant.) Isolated acts or specific
achievements should not be the sole basis for promotion under this program.
Stripes for Exceptional Performers promotion opportunities are limited,
therefore Commanders are encouraged to recognize and promote their exemplary
performers who meet the minimum promotion eligibility criteria. Date of rank
and effective date is the date the selection authority announces the promotion.</span></p>

  Multiply each enlisted performance report's point value (note 4), preceding
  the promotion eligibility cutoff date, not to exceed 3 reports, by the
  time-weighted factor for that specific report When the maximum three enlisted
  performance reports are calculated the time weighted factors begins with 50
  percent (.50) for the most recent report, 30 percent (.30) for the middle or
  second most recent report, and 20 percent (.20) for the bottom report (50% -
  30% -20%). After calculating each report, add the total weighted point value
  of each report for a sum. When an Airman is in their second year of
  eligibility, and/or when only two reports are calculated, the time weighted
  factor begins with 60 percent (.60) for the top or most recent report and 40
  percent (.40) for the bottom report (60% - 40%). When an Airman is in their
  first year of promotion eligibility and/or when only one enlisted performance

<p><span>15.39.4.<b>&nbsp;Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief
Master Sergeant.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Consideration for
promotion to the grades of Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief
Master Sergeant is done through a two-phased process. Phase I is similar to the
Weighted Airman Promotion System evaluation for Staff Sergeant and Technical
Sergeant, although some promotion factors differ. Phase II consists of a
central evaluation board held at Air Force Personnel Center using the
whole-person concept. All promotion eligibles for each cycle are reviewed by
the central evaluation board. The Air Force selects senior NCOs with the
highest scores in each Air Force specialty code for promotion, within the quota
limitations. If more than one senior NCO has the same total score at the cutoff
point, the Air Force promotes everyone with that score. Table 15.5 (Master
Sergeant cycle) and Table 15.6 (Senior Master Sergeant/Chief Master Sergeant
cycles) detail how points are calculated.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.40. Weighted Airman Promotion System Testing:</span></b></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>General Responsibilities and Score Notices.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Preparing for
promotion testing is solely an individual responsibility. Weighted Airman
Promotion System score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their
relative standing in the promotion consideration process and should never be
provided to or used by anyone other than the individual and his or her
commander. An Airman's scores cannot be disclosed without the Airman's written
consent. Commanders support staff, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not
authorized access to an Airman's Weighted Airman Promotion System scores. The
commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of promotion selection or
nonselection results and may need to review their score notices to determine
status. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and
advisory counseling on behalf of the Airman and must not allow further
dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice
on the virtual military personnel flight after the initial promotion selection
for the current cycle.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Individual Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Personal
involvement is critical. As a minimum, all Airmen testing must:</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Know their promotion eligibility status.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Maintain their specialty and military
qualifications to retain their eligibility.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Use a self-initiated program of individual
study and effort to advance their career under Weighted Airman Promotion
System.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.4.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Obtain all current study references for a
particular promotion cycle.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.5.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Review the annual Enlisted Promotions
References and Requirements Catalog to check availability and receipt of
correct study references.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.6.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Be prepared to test the first day of the
testing window and throughout the testing cycle. Members who will be
unavailable during the entire testing cycle due to a scheduled temporary duty
must be prepared to test prior to temporary duty departure even if the
temporary duty departure is before the first day of the testing cycle. Airman
may opt to test early provided the correct test booklets are available.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.7.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Ensure they receive at least 60 days of
access to study materials prior to testing.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.40.2.8.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>(For Master Sergeant, Senior Master
Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant eligibles) Ensure their selection folder at

<p><span><span>15.42.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Test Developers.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Airman
Advancement Division, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, produces all Air
Force enlisted promotion tests, which are written by Airmen for Airmen.
Although the tests are developed at Airman Advancement Division, senior NCOs
from across the Air Force travel to Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph to develop
and validate the test questions. For specialty knowledge tests, senior NCO
subject-matter experts are selected based on their specialties and job
experience. For Promotion Fitness and United States Air Force Supervisory
Examinations, Chief Master Sergeants are selected based on Air Force
demographics, extensive experience, and major command representation. Test
development specialists provide psychometric and developmental expertise
required to ensure the tests are credible, valid, and fair to all examinees.
All enlisted promotion tests are revised annually.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.42.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Test Development Process.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airman Advancement
Division test development specialist's work closely with Air Force career field
managers to stay abreast of changes affecting career fields which may impact
promotion test development. At the beginning of a test development project, the
most current tests are administered to the subject-matter experts. This gives
subjectmatter experts the point of view of the test takers and helps them
evaluate how the test content relates to performance in their specialties. They
carefully check the references of each question. Only after this is
accomplished do they begin developing new test questions. Every question on a
test comes from one of the publications listed in the&nbsp;<i>Enlisted
Promotions References and Requirements Catalog</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.42.3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Specialty Knowledge Tests.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Specialty knowledge
tests measure important job knowledge required of Staff Sergeants, Technical Sergeants,
and Master Sergeants in a particular specialty. Senior NCOs from each career
field, guided by test development specialists, develop tests for their Air
Force specialty using the specific career field education and training plan,
occupational analysis data, and their experiences to tie test content to
important tasks performed in the specialty.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.42.4.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Promotion Fitness Examination and United
States Air Force Supervisory Examination.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Promotion
Fitness Examination measures military and supervisory knowledge required of
Staff Sergeants, Technical Sergeants, and Master Sergeants. The United States
Air Force Supervisory Examination evaluates practical military, supervisory,
and managerial knowledge required for the top two non-commissioned grades.
Chief Master Sergeants from across the Air Force, guided by test development
specialists, develop these tests using the Military Knowledge and Testing
System chart and their experience.</span></p>

<p><span><b><span>15.43.</span></b></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Promotion Test Administration and Scoring.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Promotion tests are
administered to all Airmen competing for promotion to the grades of Staff
Sergeant through Chief Master Sergeant. To the greatest extent possible, test
administration procedures are standardized to ensure fairness for all members
competing for promotion. Strict procedures are used for handling, storing, and
transmitting test booklets and answer sheets to preclude the possibility of
loss or compromise. All promotion tests are electronically scored at Air Force
Personnel Center following thorough quality control steps to ensure accurate
test results for each member. The test scanning and scoring process contains
many safeguards to verify accuracy, including hand-scoring a percentage of
answer sheets (pulled randomly), and physically reviewing answer sheets.
Because of the difficulty of the tests, some individuals may receive scores
they believe do not reflect their study efforts. Likewise, some members may
receive the same score as the previous year. Information concerning
verification of test scores is contained in AFI 36-2605.</span></p>

<p><span><b><span>15.44.</span></b></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Air Force Enlisted Promotion Test
Compromise.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Group study (two or
more people) is strictly prohibited. This prohibition protects the integrity of
the promotion testing program by ensuring promotion test scores are a reflection
of each member's individual knowledge. Enlisted personnel who violate these
prohibitions are subject to prosecution under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of
Military Justice for violating a lawful general regulation. Conviction can
result in a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and
confinement for up to 2 years. Information concerning enlisted promotion test
compromise is contained in AFI 36-2605. In addition to group study, specific
test compromise situations include, but are not limited to:</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.44.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Discussing the contents of a specialty
knowledge test, promotion fitness examination, or United States Air Force
supervisory examination with anyone other than the test control officer or test
examiner. Written inquiries or complaints about a test are processed through
the test control officer.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.44.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Sharing pretests or lists of test questions
recalled from a current or previous specialty knowledge test, promotion fitness
examination, or United States Air Force supervisory examination; personal study
materials; underlined or highlighted study reference material; and commercial
study guides with other individuals.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.44.3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Although the Air Force does not recommend
or support commercial study guides, they may be used to prepare for promotion
testing. Placing commercial study guide software on government computers is
prohibited because doing so implies Air Force sanctioning of the guides.
Additionally, there are prohibitions against developing commercial study
guides.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.44.4.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Creating, storing, or transferring personal
study notes on government computers. Government computers may be used to view
electronic versions of official study references such as this pamphlet, Air
Force instructions, Air Force policy directives, technical orders, etc.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Training designed to improve general
military knowledge, such as NCO of the quarter or Senior Airman below the zone
boards, does not constitute group study as long as the intent of the training
is not to study for promotion tests. Likewise, training to improve general
study habits or test-taking skills is permissible if the training does not
focus on preparing for promotion tests. However, individuals may not
collaborate in any way or at any time to prepare for promotion testing.</span></p>

<p><span><b><span>15.45.</span></b></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><b><span>Supplemental Promotion Actions.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force Personnel
Center conducts in-system promotion consideration on a monthly basis.
Supplemental evaluation boards for promotion to the grades of Master Sergeant,
Senior Master Sergeant, and Chief Master Sergeant are conducted on a semiannual
basis. Remember, supplemental promotion consideration may not be granted if the
error or omission appeared on the data verification record, or in the senior
NCO selection record, located in the personnel records display application, and
the individual did not take the necessary steps to correct the error prior to
promotion selection or prior to the evaluation board. Fully documented
supplemental consideration requests, to include proof of corrective or
follow-up actions taken by the individual to correct the error, are submitted
to the military personnel section, in writing, with the recommendation of the
individual's unit commander. The military personnel section forwards the
request to Air Force Personnel Center for final approval.</span></p>

develop survey instruments, analyze the data collected, and provide actionable
Air Force specialty information. Decision makers associated with training
program responsibilities for an Air Force specialty use occupational survey
data to establish, validate, and adjust training. Decision makers associated
with personnel programs for an Air Force specialty use occupational survey data
to justify or change personnel policies and to refine, or maintain occupational
structures. Occupational survey data is provided to the Air Education and
Training Command, Airman Advancement Division to ensure enlisted promotion
tests are relevant, fair, and reliable.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.46.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>As noted in AFPD 36-26,&nbsp;<i>Total Force
Development</i>, paragraph 1.1.6., the Department of the Air Force adopted the
Instructional System Development process to develop Air Force training
programs. The Occupational Analysis Program is the&nbsp;<b><i>singularly unique
Air Force entity</i></b>&nbsp;which collects, analyzes, and reports the
job/occupational performance factors which are defined, measured, and applied
within Instructional System Development. The Occupational Analysis Program is
integral to providing an objective and factual orientation for three force
development tenets inherent to AFPD 36-26,&nbsp;<i>Total Force Development</i>:
(1) capabilities-based training (used to identify knowledge needed and specific
tasks necessitating training to meet job performance requirements); (2)
personnel classification and utilization (used to identify tasks performed at
each career stage and to validate occupational structures); and (3) promotion
testing (used to identify operationally relevant duties and tasks for test
development to promote and retain the best Airmen). (Figure
15.3.)&nbsp;</span><span><img border="0" width="461" height="306" src="afh1_files/image242.png" ></span><b><span>Figure 15.3. Occupational Analysis Data:
Hierarchy of Impact</span></b></p>



<p><span><span>15.46.3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>The Occupational Analysis Division conducts
occupational studies on enlisted Air Force specialties on a periodic basis,
typically a 3- to 4-year cycle, and upon request (if out of cycle). Special
studies, to include officer Air Force specialties and civilian occupational
series, are conducted upon request. Career field leaders and subject matter
experts are key to the process in developing the content of the survey
instruments. Occupational surveys are administered to all eligible personnel in
the targeted Air Force specialty or civilian occupational series through direct
email (AFNet).</span></p>

<p><span>15.46.3.1. Data
Presentation and Applications.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.46.3.1.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Occupational survey results are reported in
occupational analysis reports. Occupational analysis reports data includes
information on the duties and responsibilities performed by career field
members in the form of task statements and duty areas. Collectively, this data
describe the work performed by career field members in their jobs (Air Force
Specialty Code) and throughout each stage of their career. Additionally,
occupational survey data provides supporting information on when and how
members should be trained to perform their jobs. Enlisted career field training
personnel use occupational survey data (e.g., skill-level member data) as the
primary source of empirical data to support decisions on&nbsp;<i>what</i>&nbsp;type
of training is needed,&nbsp;<i>who</i>&nbsp;needs the training, and to
what&nbsp;<i>depth</i>&nbsp;the training should be taught...<i>Right Skills *
Right Time * Right Place</i>.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.46.3.1.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Career field leaders at specialty training
requirements team sessions and/or utilization and training workshops are
primary users of occupational survey data. These conferences of career field
leaders, and training and personnel specialists evaluate existing training
requirements for relevancy and efficacy. Based on occupational survey data,
conference attendees make changes to career field education and training plans,
career development course content, and the Air Force Specialty/Air Force Specialty
Code description of duties, responsibilities, and qualifications as depicted in
their respective Air Force Classification Directory (Enlisted. officer, or
civilian Office of Personnel Management Handbook).</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.46.3.1.3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Occupational survey data is also crucial in
the development and validation of specialty knowledge test content integral to
the Weighted Airman Promotion System. Occupational survey data are the
objective source of job information available to specialty knowledge test
development teams to construct promotion examinations that meet the
requirements for relevance, fairness, and reliability. The Occupational
Analysis Program produces a collective measure of occupational survey data
which identifies mission essential tasks (areas of work) that suggests this
data should serve as the basis for relevant promotion test content.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.46.3.1.4.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>The Occupational Analysis process and data
application are conducted IAW AFI 36-2623,&nbsp;<i>Occupational Analysis</i>&nbsp;and
supported by AFPD 36-26,&nbsp;<i>Total Force Development</i>, AFMAN
36-2234,&nbsp;<i>Instructional System Development (ISD)</i>, and AFH 36-2235,
Vol 9,&nbsp;<i>ISD Application to Technical Training</i>. Additionally, the
Occupational Analysis process supports the requirements referenced in AFI
36-2201,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Formal Training</i>, AFI 36-2101,&nbsp;<i>Classifying
Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted)</i>, AFI 36-2605,&nbsp;<i>Air Force
Military Personnel Testing System</i>, and AETCI 36-2641,&nbsp;<i>Technical and
Basic Military Training Development</i>.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.46.4.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>All career field members have pivotal roles
with the constructive outcomes of occupational studies. Airmen of a career
field being surveyed must devote the necessary time and commitment in
completing their assigned occupational surveys. As stated previously, the data
collected from each Airman, each survey participant, translates into
operationally relevant training programs for their Air Force Specialty Code,
and fair and reliable promotion tests for their career field under Weighted
Airman Promotion System.</span></p>

equipment and systems operated within a career field, you can also view job
satisfaction information, work-life balance data, and the rationale
behind&nbsp;<i>why</i>&nbsp;Airmen are reenlisting or separating from the Air
Force. This information brings great value should you be considering career
broadening through retraining.&nbsp;<b><i>Section 15I Senior NCO Promotion
Program</i></b></span></p>

<p><b><span>15.47. Individual Responsibility:</span></b></p>

<p><span><span>15.47.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>The importance of individual responsibility
cannot be overemphasized. Each individual is responsible for ensuring he or she
is properly identified as eligible for promotion consideration. (See AFI
36-2502, for minimum eligibility requirements for promotion.) Those eligible
should have the current study reference materials, know when the testing cycle
starts, ensure the information in their selection folder at Air Force Personnel
Center is accurate and complete, study as needed, and test when scheduled.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.47.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Those eligible for promotion to Master
Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant should obtain their
data verification record (Figure 15.4) through virtual military personnel
flight. The data verification record displays current career information as of
the promotion eligibility cutoff date, some of which is included in the senior
NCO evaluation brief (Figure 15.5) reviewed by the evaluation board.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.47.3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Along with reviewing the data verification
record, eligibles should review their senior NCO selection folder documents
filed in automated records management system and personnel records display
application to ensure data is accurate and appropriate documents are filed.
Promotion eligibles should notify their military personnel section of any
errors.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.48.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Promotion
Criteria:</b></span></p>

<p><span><span>15.48.1.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>As noted in the aforementioned Tables 15.5
(MSgt), 15.6 (SMSgt/CMSgt) show how to calculate weighted factors for
promotions and Table 15.3 shows the minimum eligibility requirements for
promotion to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant.</span></p>

<p><span><span>15.48.2.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Senior Master Sergeants being considered
for promotion to Chief Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the chief
enlisted manager code of the control Air Force specialty code they held as of
the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Master Sergeants being considered for
promotion to Senior Master Sergeant will compete for promotion in the
superintendent level of the control Air Force specialty code they held as of
the promotion eligibility cutoff date. Individuals with a reporting identifier
or special duty identifier, designated as their control Air Force specialty
code on the promotion eligibility cutoff date, will compete within that
reporting identifier or special duty identifier.</span></p>

evaluation board reviews all reports closing out up to 5 years prior to
Promotion Eligibility Cutoff Date. Any additional reports are listed for your
information only. If you have recently retrained or entered a Special Duty
Identifier, your control Air Force specialty code effective date is the date
you departed for training. If you detect any errors or have any questions,
contact your customer service center or personnel representative immediately.

<p><span>15.48.3. The board
considers academic education completed on or before the promotion eligibility
cutoff date. Up to three academic education levels can be reflected on the
senior NCO evaluation brief. When the academic education level is updated in
the personnel data system, the promotion file is updated and a new data
verification record and evaluation brief is produced to reflect the change. If
the Community College of the Air Force degree was awarded by Community College
of the Air Force or any other accredited college requirements were completed
before the promotion eligibility cutoff date but the evaluation brief was
completed within 10 days of the board convening date, the education services
office will update the personnel data system. The individual must notify the
Air Force Personnel Center by message of this update. This information is then
used to post the senior NCO evaluation brief filed in the senior NCO selection
folder. Promotion eligible Airmen are responsible for ensuring this data is
posted on their data verification record and evaluation brief.</span></p>

<p><span>15.48.4. The
promotion eligibility cutoff date is used to determine content of the selection
folder and information on promotion evaluation briefs. The number of enlisted
performance reports included is limited to those reports closed out 5 years
before the promotion eligibility cutoff date (maximum of 10 enlisted
performance reports). Approved decorations, resubmissions, or decorations being
upgraded must be submitted and placed into official channels before the
selection date. The data shown on the senior NCO evaluation brief includes the
member's name, social security number, grade, date of rank, Air Force specialty
information, service dates (to include projected retirement date), academic
education level, decorations, duty information, duty history, and professional
military education/Community College of the Air Force completion.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.49.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Evaluation
Board.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The evaluation
board is very important because the evaluation board accounts for over half the
total score. Understanding how board members are selected, the evaluation board
process, and those areas considered by board members can provide valuable
insight into what is required to get promoted.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.1.<b>&nbsp;Selection of Board Members.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The number of
promotion eligible personnel identified by major command and Air Force
specialty codes determines the number and career field backgrounds of the board
members. Board members are divided into panels, each consisting of one colonel
and two Chief Master Sergeants. The board president is always a general
officer. Before evaluating records, board members are briefed on the task
objective, eligible population profile, and selection folder content. Board
members are then sworn to complete the board's task without prejudice or
partiality. They also participate in an extensive trial-run process to ensure
scoring consistency before evaluating any  live  records.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.<b>&nbsp;Areas the Board Considers.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The board looks at performance,
education, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence,
specific achievements, and leadership. In each area, the individual has control
over the information the board reviews. Individuals therefore not board
members are responsible for their own promotions by ensuring the board receives
the most current updates.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Performance.</b>&nbsp;The
evaluation board reviews all enlisted performance reports for the 5 years
preceding the promotion eligibility cutoff date. The board members consider all
aspects of the enlisted performance report  job description (key duties, tasks,
and responsibilities), individual rating factors, periods of supervision,
overall evaluations, levels of endorsements, and each narrative word picture.
If the person is an exceptional performer, the enlisted performance reports
should convey to the board that he or she has demonstrated the highest
qualities required of a leader and manager.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Education.</b>&nbsp;When
considering educational opportunities, enlisted members should focus on a
degree program that complements their career field and enhances their ability
to do their job. When the board evaluates academic education as part of the
whole-person assessment, the most important consideration should be the degree
to which the education enhances the member's potential to serve in the next
higher grade.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.3.<b>&nbsp;Breadth
of Experience.</b>&nbsp;This factor refers to the individual's overall
professional background, experience, and knowledge gained during his or her career
to the present. Board members consider knowledge and practical experience in
areas other than the current Air Force specialty code. If the eligible
individual remained in one career field, board members consider whether he or
she had wide exposure across the career field. Board members also consider
potential to fill other types of jobs, as well as supervisory and managerial
experience.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Job
Responsibility.</b>&nbsp;This factor does not refer entirely to the career
field's command-level positions, although experience at this level is a
consideration. Many base-level jobs demand just as much of an individual as
jobs at higher command levels. Consideration is primarily given to what was
asked of the individual and how well the individual accomplished the task. Did
the job require significant decisions, or was it a job in which the individual
routinely carried out the decisions of others? Is the individual a proven,
effective leader, responsible for directing the work of others, or is the
person responsible only for his or her own performance?</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.5.<b>&nbsp;Professional
Competence.</b>&nbsp;What do rating and endorsing officials say about the
individual's expertise? Is it truly outstanding? How much does the individual
know about the job, and how well does he or she accomplish it? The Air Force
Chief of Staff has emphasized the need for careful selection of individuals for
promotion to the senior NCO grades. Therefore, those selected must be the best
qualified. They must have sufficient leadership and managerial experience to
prepare them for the challenges they, and the Air Force, face.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.6.<b>&nbsp;Specific
Achievements.</b>&nbsp;These are often recognized in the form of awards and
decorations. However, many other significant accomplishments are often
addressed in the enlisted performance report's narrative comments. Such
recognition, either in the form of decorations or narrative comments, can help
board members identify truly outstanding performers.</span></p>

<p><span>15.49.2.7.<b>&nbsp;Leadership.</b>&nbsp;Board
members use their judgment, expertise, and maturity when reviewing records to
assess a member's potential to serve in a higher grade. In particular, board
members evaluate leadership potential. How well does he or she manage, lead,
and interact with peers and subordinates? What have rating officials said about
the person's leadership qualities and potential? What haven t they said?</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.50.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Evaluation
Process:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.50.1.<b>&nbsp;Trial Run.</b></span></p>

<p><span>As previously
mentioned, board members are given two selected sets of records to score as a
practice exercise before the actual scoring process. Using the whole-person
concept, they score the records using secret ballots. This process helps
establish a scoring standard they can apply consistently throughout the board
process.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.2.<b>&nbsp;Scoring:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.50.2.1. After
the trial run is completed and discussed, panels begin the actual scoring of
live records. The same panel evaluates all eligibles competing in a chief
enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code. Each panel member scores
each record, using a 6- to 10-point scale and half-point increments. An
individual's record may receive a panel composite score (3 members) from a
minimum of 18 (6-6-6) to a maximum of 30 (10-10-10) points. The composite score
(18 to 30 points) is later multiplied by a factor of 15, resulting in a total board
score (270 to 450). Using a secret ballot, panel members score the record
individually with no discussion. Records are given to each panel member, and
after they are scored, the ballots are given directly to a recorder. This
ensures each panel member has scored each record independently.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.2.2. A record scored with a difference of more than 1 point
between any of the panel members (for example, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0) is termed a
split vote and is returned to the panel for resolution. At this point, all
panel members may discuss the record openly among themselves. This allows them
to state why they scored the record as they did. Only those panel members
directly involved in the split may change their scores. If panel members cannot
come to an agreement on the split vote, they give the record to the board
president for resolution. This ensures consistency of scoring and eliminates
the possibility that one panel member will have a major impact (positive or
negative) on an individual's board score.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.2.3. Actual
scores will vary between panels; the specific reason why certain panels scored
the way they did cannot be determined because this is a subjective decision.
However, because a single panel reviews each chief enlisted manager code or Air
Force specialty code, all records within a chief enlisted manager code or Air
Force specialty code are evaluated under the same standard. Some panels may
award high scores, while others may award low ones. Therefore, whether a panel
scores  easy  or  hard  is not significant. The important part of the final
board score is how one eligible compares to his or her peers in the final order
of merit. This allows each eligible to see how competitive he or she was.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.2.4. Because
each board is completely independent, board members do not know how an
individual scored or ranked during the previous cycle. Each board arrives at
their own scoring standard. However, as long as everyone competing in a chief
enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code is looked at under the same
standard, fair and equitable consideration is ensured. A number of factors
affect board scores from year to year new panel members with different thought
processes, previous promotion eligible with changed or improved records, and a
large pool of new eligibles. As a result, board scores do vary (often
significantly) from one board to the next.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.2.5.
Board members do not have access to the weighted scores of individuals
competing for promotion. Their primary concern is to align all eligible in a relative
order of merit, based on their panel score, within their chief enlisted manager
code or Air Force specialty code. When board members leave, they do not know
who was selected.</span></p>

<p><span>They only know they
have reviewed and scored each record within the standard that evolved from the
trial run.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.3.<b>&nbsp;Not Fully Qualified Process:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.50.3.1. A
process associated with enlisted promotion boards often misunderstood is the
not fully qualified process. As previously stated, senior NCO evaluation board
members use the whole-person concept to align promotion eligible in a relative
order of merit within their chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty
code based on the quality of each promotion eligible's senior NCO evaluation
record. Also, board members are formally charged to ensure individuals are not
only best qualified, but also fully qualified to assume the responsibilities of
the next higher grade.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.3.2. If the
board determines an individual is not fully qualified based on an evaluation of
the record, the individual is rendered not fully qualified for promotion. In
this case, Air Force Personnel Center removes the individual from promotion
consideration and deactivates his or her promotion record, rendering the
individual ineligible for promotion. The parent major command and military
personnel section are then notified of the board's decision in writing. The
parent major command must immediately notify the individual through the unit
commander. The board is not allowed to disclose the exact rationale for their
findings. However, factors contributing to the decision can be as general as an
overall noncompetitive record when compared to peers or as specific as a
demonstrated substandard performance and disciplinary problems. Additionally,
the chief enlisted manager may have a very small number of eligibles and the
board has exercised the authority to prevent promotion by default. In any
event, the member is ineligible for that cycle.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.4.<b>&nbsp;Post-Board Processing.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>After the board is
finished, the weighted factor scores are combined with the board scores. This
completely electronic operation builds an order of merit listing by total score
within each chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code, and the
overall promotion quota is then applied to each list. After the selection
results are approved, the data is transmitted to the military personnel
section. Questions regarding the Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, and
Chief Master Sergeant promotion selection process should be directed to the
military personnel section career development element.</span></p>

<p><span>15.50.5.<b>&nbsp;Score Notice.</b></span></p>

<p><span>All eligible
personnel receive a score notice that reports how they compare to their peers
in their chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code in the
specific promotion cycle. To determine weak areas, individuals can also compare
their scores with the promotion statistics available in the military personnel
section and/or posted on the Internet via the virtual military personnel
flight. Personnel can access the virtual military personnel flight through the
Air Force Personnel Center Web site at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/"><span><span>https://gum</span></span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/"><span><span>-</span></span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/"><span><span>crm.csd.disa.mil</span></span></a><a href="https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/"><span><span>.</span></span></a></p>

<p><b><span>15.51.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Supplemental
Promotion Actions:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.51.1. Reviewing
the data verification record and senior NCO selection folder and taking prompt
action to correct any errors provides the evaluation board the most accurate
career assessment. However, if data errors or omissions occur, supplemental
promotion consideration may be granted. Supplemental consideration is not
granted if the error or omission appeared on the data verification record or in
the automated records management system/personnel records display application
and appropriate corrective and follow-up action was not taken prior to the
board convening.</span></p>

<p><span>15.51.2. Table 15.7
provides specific information concerning supplemental consideration. Requests
for supplemental consideration are submitted in writing containing the unit
commander's recommendation and processed through the military personnel
section.<b>&nbsp;</b>In addition, the military personnel section can answer
questions about the data verification record, which may eliminate the need for
supplemental consideration.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.52. Weighted Airman Promotion System Testing:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.52.1.<b>&nbsp;General Responsibilities and Score Notices.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Preparing for
promotion testing is solely an individual responsibility. Weighted Airman
Promotion System score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their
relative standing in the promotion consideration process and should never be
provided to or used by anyone other than the individual and his or her
commander. An Airman's scores cannot be disclosed without the Airman's written
consent. Commanders support staff, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not
authorized access to an Airman's Weighted Airman Promotion System scores. The
commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of promotion selection or
non-selection results and may need to review their score notices to determine
status. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and
advisory counseling on behalf of the Airman and must not allow further
dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice
on the virtual military personnel flight after the initial promotion selection
for the current cycle.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.<b>&nbsp;Individual Responsibilities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Personal
involvement is critical. As a minimum, all Airmen testing must:</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.1. Know
their promotion eligibility status.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.2. Maintain
their specialty and military qualifications to retain their eligibility.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.3. Use a
self-initiated program of individual study and effort to advance their career
under Weighted Airman Promotion System.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.4. Obtain
all current study references for a particular promotion cycle.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.5. Review
the annual Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog to check
availability and receipt of correct study references.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.6. Be
prepared to test the first day of the testing window and throughout the testing
cycle. Members who will be unavailable during the entire testing cycle due to a
scheduled temporary duty must be prepared to test prior to temporary duty
departure even if the temporary duty departure is before the first day of the
testing cycle. Airman may opt to test early provided the correct test booklets
are available.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.7. Ensure
they receive at least 60 days of access to study materials prior to testing.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.2.8. (For
Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant promotion
eligibles) Ensure their selection folder at Air Force Personnel Center is
accurate and complete.</span></p>

<p><span>15.52.3.<b>&nbsp;Data Verification Record.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The military
personnel section will instruct eligible Airmen to obtain and review his or her
data verification record on virtual military personnel flight to verify the
data used in the promotion selection process. Each eligible Airman must review
the data verification record and the master personnel records in the Automated
Records Management System/Personnel Records Display Application and report any
errors to the military personnel section. If an error is noted, the Airman must
immediately contact his or her military personnel section for assistance. The
military personnel section will update Military Personnel Data System with the
correct data. Except for updating enlisted performance report data, each change
will produce an updated promotion brief at Air Force Personnel Center and
update the data verification record on virtual military personnel flight. The
Airman's receipt of the updated data verification record ensures changes were
made. Airmen should verify the updated information. Supplemental promotion
consideration may not be granted if an error or omission appeared on the data
verification record and the individual took no corrective or follow-up action
before the promotion selection date for Staff Sergeant through Master Sergeant,
and before the original evaluation board for Senior Master Sergeant through
Chief Master Sergeant. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their data
verification record on virtual military personnel flight before the initial
promotion selection for the current cycle.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 15J Civilian
Personnel Management and Programs</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>15.53. Civilian Personnel Services.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force provides most civilian personnel services from two sources:
installation civilian personnel flights, usually located in the force support squadron,
and Air Force Personnel Center. Air Force activities collocated on an Air Force
installation with a civilian personnel flights, or within the same locality,
are to be served by that civilian personnel flights.&nbsp; When an activity is
not collocated or located near a civilian personnel flights, services are to be
provided by the nearest civilian personnel flights. Civilian Personnel Sections
must service all civilian employees to ensure they are all included in the Air
Force Civilian Personnel Program. Exceptions to the civilian personnel
servicing arrangements are to be submitted to Air Force/A1C for approval due to
impact on Reduction in Force retention and bargaining unit
representation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This includes
arrangements to centralize or decentralize civilian personnel servicing
arrangements.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.54.1. While
military pay is centrally managed by Headquarters United States Air Force,
civilian pay is a budget line item at major command, field operating agency,
and installation level, as well as at Headquarters United States Air Force. The
availability of performance payout and numbers of authorized civilian positions
comprise the base line for civilian employment levels. Civilian Pay funds are
needed for civilian overtime; performance awards; special act awards; notable
achievement awards, retention, recruitment, and relocation bonuses; student
loan repayment program, seasonal and longerterm overhires; and voluntary
separation incentive payments to minimize involuntary reduction-in-force
separations and severance pay for affected employees as the result of reduction
in force. Accurate requirement projections and development of employment plans
are critical to support the workload demand within budget, while executing work
years, end strength and civilian pay resource.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.54.2. Civilian
resource management is a team effort. Commanders and senior leaders depend on
human resource officers, financial managers, and manpower officers to recommend
effective use of employees, funds, and manpower authorizations to meet mission
requirements. Major commands and installations use a corporate board structure,
meeting at least quarterly, to manage annual appropriations, revolving funds,
or reimbursements used for civilian employment costs.</span></p>

<p><span>15.54.3. When funds
are available, civilian overhire positions can be established to handle peak
workloads, recurring annual programs, military manning shortfalls, or other
short-notice requirements that cannot be met through normal manpower
requirements or personnel assignment processes. Most overhire positions are
filled using temporary appointments (not to exceed 1 year). If the workload
continues beyond a year, term appointments of up to 5 years may be used.
Permanent appointments to overhire positions are unusual, although a permanent
employee may be placed in an overhire position in a reduction-in-force.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.55. Job Descriptions:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.55.1. Civilian
employees, except those above grade General Schedule-15 do not have a rank.
Instead, they take the grade of the position they occupy. Since the position is
graded, not the employee, detailed written job descriptions are the basis for
determining pay, qualification requirements, performance expectations, and
appraisal ratings.</span></p>

<p><span>15.55.2. Position
descriptions historically have covered duties, responsibilities, and
supervisory controls. The Air Force has expanded the scope of core personnel
documents to include performance standards, qualifications required for
recruitment, and training requirements for a new employee in the position.</span></p>

<p><span>15.55.3.
Supervisors are responsible for core personnel documents accuracy, and for
implementing standard core personnel documents from a growing library of these
documents. Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC (formally AFMA/MAH) coordinates
standard core personnel document content with appropriate Headquarters United
States Air Force functional representatives before issuing new standard core
personnel documents. Supervisors who select standard core personnel documents
save the time required to write a new document and the time a position
classification specialist would need to determine the correct pay plan or
schedule, occupation series or code, and grade. Standard core personnel
documents can also be used as templates for a unique core personnel documents
that requires a new classification analysis.</span></p>

<p><span>15.55.4. Air Force
civilian personnel sections with relatively large numbers of serviced civilian
personnel retain position classification authority and responsibilities until
they transition to Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC. Air Force Personnel
Center/DPIC performs classification support for installations with smaller
civilian employee populations. From either source, supervisors can seek
assistance in developing core personnel documents or selecting or modifying
standard core personnel documents.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.56. Filling Jobs:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.56.1. Vacant
civilian positions are filled based on an organization's needs using a variety
of recruitment sources and&nbsp; appointing authorities consistent with
applicable laws, regulations, directives and policies as established by the
Office of Personnel Management, Department of Defense, and Department of the
Air Force. Referral and selection priorities must be observed when filling
competitive service positions. Employees with mandatory selection or priority
referral rights normally include those adversely affected by reduction-in-force
through involuntary separation or demotion. These priorities may also include
transfer of function declinations or transfer of work outside the commuting
area, overseas returnees, reduction-in-force reclassification, civilian
spouses, or spouses of Regular Air Force military following a change in duty
location. Supervisors work in concert with their servicing Human Resource
specialist in the civilian personnel sections or Air Force Personnel Center to
determine appropriate recruitment sources. A vacancy for competitive fill
actions is announced, candidates are screened by Air Force Personnel Center,
and one or more lists of candidates are referred to the supervisor.</span></p>

<p><span>15.56.2. Based on
their qualifying experience and/or education, civilians can enter civil service
at different pay grade levels. The competitive staffing process used by the Air
Force and other Federal agencies determines the relative qualifications of the
candidates and refers only the best qualified for selection. Office of
Personnel Management provides agencies with qualification standards written
broadly for government-wide application. The standards are covered by either a
Group Standard (multiple occupations) or by Individual Occupation. The Group
Standards cover occupations under Professional and Scientific, Administrative
and Management, Technical and Medical Support, Clerical and Administrative
Support and Student Trainee positions. Some occupations have education
requirements identified in the qualification standards. The level of education
is dependent upon the duties and the grade of the position. Many jobs in
professional and related occupations require a 4-year college degree. Some of
these occupations including engineers, physicians and surgeons, and biological
and physical scientists require a bachelor's or higher degree in a specific
field of study. 5 United States Code, Section 3308 prohibits requiring
education for positions that are competed, unless Office of Personnel
Management has determined the duties of a scientific, technical, or
professional position cannot be performed by an individual who does not have
the prescribed minimum education. The minimum qualification requirements are
listed on job announcements which may include specific job-related work
experience, education level, medical or physical standards, training, security,
certifications and/or licensure requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>15.56.3.
Competitive placements require collaboration between supervisors and human
resource specialists at the civilian personnel sections or the Air Force
Personnel Center. Human resource specialists advise supervisors regarding
recruitment sources. The minimum area of consideration includes Department of
Defense-wide, Transfer and Reinstatement eligibles for all locally and
centrally managed permanent positions. Exceptions to the standard area of
consideration will be limited to positions subject to the Developmental Team
process, career broadener/intern outplacements and placements to minimize
adverse action.</span></p>

<p><span>15.56.4. Once
established priority requirements are cleared, the vacancy is announced for
competitive actions. The supervisor is issued a candidate referral list of
qualified candidate names. Once the supervisor receives the candidate referral
list, he or she may confer with the human resource specialist for interview
procedures. If an interview is used as part of the selection process, the
supervisor arranges the interview. Interviews are required for all General
Schedule-14 and General Schedule-15 positions. Should the selecting official
choose to interview, questions must be approved by the civilian personnel
sections prior to use. All candidates should be asked the same questions, and
the interview periods should be of relatively equal length. Some interview
requirements may be defined by a locally negotiated agreement with the
representative union.</span></p>

<p><span>15.56.5. Centrally
managed career programs cover most vacancies in grades General Schedule-12
through General Schedule-15. Senior functional managers set career development
and placement policies for employees in career program covered positions. These
positions are subject to the same recruitment processes as non-centrally
managed positions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.57. Training and Development.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air Force policy
provides for necessary training to improve skills needed in employee
performance. Supervisors are responsible for determining training requirements
and working with the civilian personnel sections or education and training
function to identify appropriate training sources. Organizational funds must
often be used to support training needs; however, civilian training funds are
often available.</span></p>

<p><span>15.57.1.<b>&nbsp;Identifying Training Requirements:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.57.1.1.
Conducted annually is a training-needs survey which provides the supervisor an
opportunity to project training requirements for the upcoming fiscal year. Due
to unforecasted mission requirements, however; supervisors may request an
out-of-cycle training need at any time during the year.</span></p>

<p><span>15.57.1.2. Although
first-line supervisors are the key individuals in determining development
needs, they may need additional guidance from higher-level management, other
supervisors, or the employees themselves. The servicing employee development
specialist is available to assist in training needs analysis and identification
of methods and training sources.</span></p>

<p><span>15.57.1.3. Not all
training and developmental needs can or should be met through Air Force
sponsorship. Employees are responsible for independently pursuing training and
education that will prepare them for promotion or develop them for career
transitions. Such self-development activity is employee initiated and
accomplished during off-duty hours. Supervisors should encourage civilian
employees to participate in self-development activities, when appropriate.
Civilian tuition assistance is available in some major commands and field
operating agencies.</span></p>

<p><span>15.57.2.<b>&nbsp;Training Sources:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.57.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Primary
Training Sources.</b>&nbsp;Once training needs are identified, the next step is
to determine training sources. The three primary sources of training are agency
(Air Force), interagency, and nongovernment. Training away from the work site
is requested, approved, and documented using Standard Form 182,&nbsp;<i>Authorization,
Agreement and Certification of Training.</i></span></p>

<p><span>15.57.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Agency
Training.</b>&nbsp;Agency training is conducted by the employer (Air Force) and
may include on-thejob training, in-house training, and Air Force formal
schools. On-the-job training and in-house training are often the most effective
because the supervisor tailors the training to meet the specific job
requirements. On-the-job training usually is as casual as giving a few pointers
to a new worker or as formal as a fully structured training program with
timetables and specified subjects. Therefore, on-the-job training can include
directing employees to appropriate publications for self-study. Some functional
activities also use in-house training. This type of training is very effective
when a large number of employees need instruction on common aspects of
occupational skill requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.57.2.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Air
Force Formal Schools.</b>&nbsp;More formalized agency classroom training is
available through Air Force formal schools listed in the Web-based&nbsp;<i>Education
and Training Course Announcements (ETCA)</i>&nbsp;located at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://etca.randolph.af.mil/"><span><span>https://etca.randolph.af.mil/</span></span></a><a href="https://etca.randolph.af.mil/"><span><span>.</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;Career field management programs plan
for and sponsor developmental assignments, tuition assistance, formal training,
and education to develop current and future managers. Leadership and management
developmental opportunities, including intermediate service school and senior
service school, are available to eligible high-potential civilian employees.
Information is available at</span><a href="http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></a><a href="http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/"><span><span>www.afciviliancareers.com</span></span></a><a href="http://www.afciviliancareers.com/apply/howtoapply/"><span><span>.</span></span></a></p>

<p><span>15.57.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Interagency
Training.</b>&nbsp;This training may be needed if agency sources are not
adequate to meet identified training needs. Interagency training includes all
training sponsored by other United States government agencies. Office of
Personnel Management, the United States Departments of Army and Navy, and the
United States Departments of Labor and Agriculture are just a few sources from
which to obtain training.</span></p>

<p><span>15.57.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Nongovernmental
Training.</b>&nbsp;Federal regulations require agencies to consider and select
government training sources before turning to nongovernment alternatives.
However, nongovernment sources may be considered when agency or interagency courses
cannot satisfy the training need or when nongovernment training is more
advantageous. Nongovernment sources incorporate a wide range of seminars,
conferences, courses, and workshops, as well as curricula offered by private
educational institutions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.58. Performance, Conduct, and Discipline:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.58.1.&nbsp;<b>Performance Planning, Appraisals, and Awards for
Employees.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The employee is
advised of the duties and responsibilities of the job and the supervisor s
performance expectations in their core personnel document. Employees receive
annual appraisals on how well they perform their duties. Supervisors may reward
employees for performing their duties well. A performance award is a management
option to recognize high performance.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.1.1.
Supervisors set the performance elements (duties and tasks) for the civilian
employees they supervise. In developing an employee's performance elements,
supervisors determine the major and important requirements of the employee s
job based on the employee's direct contribution to organization or work unit
objectives.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.1.2.
Performance standards prescribe how a particular element or duty must be
accomplished. Set by supervisors, the standards must reflect levels necessary
for acceptable performance. When possible, supervisors should identify
observable behaviors that lead to success on the job.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b><i>&nbsp;</i>Elements
and standards are documented in writing on Air Force Form 860,&nbsp;<i>Civilian
Performance Plan</i>, if a core personnel document is not used.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.1.3. The
performance appraisal is the basis for personnel actions to identify and
correct work performance problems, recognize and reward quality performance,
improve productivity, and grant periodic pay increases. Supervisors review the
employee's performance of each element and rate the performance against each
element's standards and then render an overall summary rating. AFI
36-1001,&nbsp;<i>Managing the Civilian Performance Program</i>, provides
guidance for evaluating civilian employee performance for General Schedule and
Federal Wage System employees.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.1.4.
Performance awards (performance cash award, time-off award, and quality step
increase) can be used as tools to motivate General Schedule and Federal Wage
System employees to perform above an acceptable level as well as compensate them
for performing beyond expectations. Effective management of the performance
awards program can help improve productivity and morale in the organization.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.1.5. Poor
performance must be corrected. Employees who fail one or more performance
elements are administered an unacceptable appraisal and will have an
opportunity to improve. Causes for poor performance are identified (medical
conditions, training deficiencies, etc.). However, if performance does not
improve to a satisfactory level, the employee may be removed from the position.
Placement in another position at the same or lower grade is possible.
Separation from civilian employment is also possible.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.2.<b>&nbsp;Personal Conduct:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.58.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Standards
of Conduct.</b>&nbsp;AFI 36-703,&nbsp;<i>Civilian Conduct and Responsibility</i>,
and the Department of Defense 5500.7-R,&nbsp;<i>Joint Ethics Regulation</i>,
cover activities that are mandatory for civilian employees and activities that
are prohibited. Employees are required to comply with standards of conduct in
all official matters. Employees are expected to maintain high standards of
honesty, responsibility, and accountability and to adhere to the Air Force core
values of&nbsp;<i>Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All
We Do</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Required
Activities.&nbsp;</b>Among required activities are: furnishing testimony in
official investigations and hearings consistent with protections against
self-incrimination; paying lawful debts and taxes; being present for work
unless authorized to be absent; complying with health, safety, and all other
proper instructions regarding work; presenting a positive public image and
complying with reasonable dress and grooming standards; and maintaining
professional relationships with fellow workers, subordinates, and supervisors.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Prohibited
Actions.&nbsp;</b>Prohibited actions follow the guidance in federal laws and
government-wide regulations, as well as Department of Defense and Air Force
instructions. Discrimination and sexual harassment, drug and alcohol abuse,
misuse of government purchase cards, misuse of government computers, vehicles
and other equipment, taking bribes, conducting personal business at work, and
criminal behavior off-duty that reflect adversely on Air Force employment are
among the prohibited activities. The Air Force does not attempt to list all
possible forms of improper conduct but warns employees that misconduct will not
be tolerated.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.<b>&nbsp;Discipline:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.1.
Disciplinary action is taken to correct employee misconduct or performance when
the employee can control the essentials of the performance problems and has the
skills, knowledge, and capacity to perform well but is unwilling to do so.
Guidance is in AFI 36-704,&nbsp;<i>Discipline and Adverse Actions</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.2. The Air
Force goal in the area of civilian discipline is to maintain a constructive
work environment. If a disciplinary or adverse action must be taken against a
civilian employee, this action must be done without regard to race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or other factors (such as marital
status or politics). Actions based on an employee's inability to perform
because of a physical or mental disability should only be taken when the
employee's disability cannot be reasonably accommodated.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.3. The
employee must receive advance notice of impending actions. Disciplinary or
adverse actions must be prompt and equitable and comply with the intent and
letter of all governing requirements, and respect must be given to the private
nature of the actions.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.4. Proper
administration of discipline is a chief concern of labor organizations
representing Air Force employees. Procedures governing disciplinary and adverse
actions are common features of most Air Force labormanagement agreements.
Moreover, a basic tenet of federal labor relations law states that an employee
who is a member of a bargaining unit has a right to union representation, upon
the employee's request, during an investigatory interview where the employee
reasonably believes disciplinary action may result from the interview.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.5. Oral
admonishment, the least severe disciplinary action, is often adequate to
improve work habits or correct behavior. For significant misconduct or repeated
infractions, a written reprimand may be an appropriate penalty. Written
reprimands are recorded in the employee personnel record for a specified
period, as directed by AFI 36-704, or an applicable negotiated labor-management
contract.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.6.
Suspension is a disciplinary action that may be imposed for more serious
infractions when the situation indicates that a lesser penalty is not adequate.
A suspension is a particularly severe disciplinary action that places the
employee in a nonpay and nonduty status, usually for a specific length of time.
Employees accused of serious crime may be suspended indefinitely until criminal
justice is complete.</span></p>

<p><span>15.58.3.7. For
employees who have received oral admonishments, written reprimands, or
suspensions and whose behavior continues to be inappropriate, or for such a
onetime egregious event of misconduct, removal may occur. Like all other
disciplinary actions, the supervisor must ensure the disciplinary action is
warranted and well documented. Reprimands, suspensions, and removals must be
coordinated with the civilian personnel sections and the staff judge advocate
so a procedural violation or an administrative oversight does not jeopardize a
valid disciplinary action.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.59. Working Conditions:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.59.1.<b>&nbsp;Pay:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.59.1.1. Civilian
employees are paid every 2 weeks. General Schedule employee pay is expressed as
an annual salary and high cost areas have higher pay rates. All General
Schedule pay rates in the United States include locality pay and pay rates
overseas do not include locality pay and are approximately 10 percent lower
than United States rates. General Schedule pay scales normally increase in
January through the legislative process.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.1.2. The
Federal Wage System consists of wage grade, wage leader, and wage supervisor.
The Federal Wage System pay is expressed as hourly wage rates. Federal Wage System
rates vary more between local areas than General Schedule. Federal Wage System
rates may also be increased annually but on an area-by-area basis throughout
the year.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.1.3. Both
General Schedule and Federal Wage System have steps in each grade. Employees
progress through the steps via longevity. The General Schedule grades have 10
steps. Within grade or step increases start at 1-year intervals, but slow to
3-year intervals in the higher steps. Federal Wage System grades have five
steps. Federal Wage System within grade increases start at 6-month intervals
and slow to 2-year intervals.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.1.4. Pay for
overtime is at time-and-a-half or 1.5 times base pay. Overtime pay for General
Schedule employees is capped at 1.5 times the GS-10, step 1, pay rate; for
employees with rates of basic pay greater than the basic pay for General
Schedule-10, step 1, the overtime hourly rate is the greater of either the
hourly rate of basic pay for General Schedule-10, step 1, multiplied by 1.5, or
the employee's hourly rate of basic pay. Instead of overtime pay, an employee
may receive compensatory time off for each hour of overtime worked. Work at
night, on Sunday, and on a federal holiday earns extra pay.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.2.<b>&nbsp;Work Hours:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.59.2.1. Civilian
work hours are more precisely defined and less flexible than those of Regular
Air Force military personnel. Civilian work schedules are defined in such terms
as administrative workweek, basic workweek, regular tour of duty, uncommon tour
of duty, and part-time tour of duty. Most civilians work a regular tour of
duty. Normally, this is five 8-hour days, Monday through Friday. Uncommon tours
of duty (a 40-hour basic workweek that includes Saturday and/or Sunday or fewer
than 5 days, but not more than 6 days of a 7-day administrative workweek) are
authorized when necessary for mission accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.2.2. Special
circumstances permit part-time, intermittent, or special tours of duty.
Installation and tenant commanders establish, by written order, daily work
hours to include designated rest and lunch periods. Two types of alternate work
schedules can be implemented by organization commanders. Flexible work
schedules allow employees to start and end work at different times. Compressed
work schedules cover 80 hours in a pay period in fewer than 10 workdays. The
most common schedule has four 9-hour days each week, an 8-hour day in 1 week,
and a regular day off in the other week. AFI 36-807,&nbsp;<i>Weekly and Daily
Scheduling of Work and Holiday Observances,&nbsp;</i>covers work scheduling.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.3.<b>&nbsp;Absence and Leave:</b></span></p>

<p><span>15.59.3.1. Civilian
employees earn 13 days of sick leave each year and 13, 20, or 26 days of annual
leave, depending on their length of service. Annual leave accumulation is
capped at 30 days for most General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees.
Employees working overseas can accumulate 45 days. There is no cap on sick
leave accumulation.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.3.2. Annual
leave is used for vacations and/or personal reasons and should be approved in
advance of being taken, unless emergency conditions exist. Leave is charged and
taken in 15-minute increments. Sick leave for medical appointments or care for
a family member should be scheduled and approved in advance except in cases of
emergency. Illness or injury that keeps an employee away from work should be
reported to a supervisor during the first two hours of the duty day.</span></p>

<p><span>15.59.3.3. Absence
for jury duty, dismissals for extreme weather conditions, or absences excused
by the installation commander are not charged to annual leave. Employees who have
earned compensatory time for overtime or timeoff awards should schedule
absences to use that time like they schedule annual leave. Absence and leave
are covered in AFI 36-815,&nbsp;<i>Absence and Leave.</i></span></p>

<p><b><span>15.60. Unions in the Air Force:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.60.1.
Approximately 70 percent of Air Force civilian employees are covered by labor
agreements between unions and installations or major commands. As such, they
are members of the bargaining unit, even if they are not dues-paying union
members. Unions have legal status under federal law. Guidance is included in
AFI 36-701,&nbsp;<i>Labor Management Relations.</i></span></p>

<p><span>15.60.2. A labor
relations officer or specialist in the civilian personnel sections is the usual
liaison between supervisors and other management officials and union officials.
The job can be full-time or part of a larger assignment. The labor relations
officer speaks for management in routine communications with the union and with
parties outside the Air Force who have roles in labor contract negotiations and
dispute resolution.</span></p>

<p><span>15.60.3. A variety
of union officials may act for, and make commitments for, unions. These include
elected officers such as the president, vice president, and treasurer; and
appointed officials such as stewards and union delegates to special meetings or
projects. As part of a democratic organization, the union official may be
required to present issues to a committee, such as a bargaining committee for
approval. At other times, the official may have been delegated authority to
make commitments. One of the duties of union officials is to raise employee
concerns in the early stages of policy formulation and to resolve employee
complaints. Managers should strive to work with union officials, particularly
where grievances have been filed, in a professional, nondefensive manner.</span></p>

<p><span>15.60.4. Management
and union representatives negotiate collective bargaining agreements
(contracts) covering grievance procedures, use of official time for union
matters, use of Air Force resources by unions such as office space, telephone, and
computers, and other local or major command-wide items of interest impacting
the working conditions of bargaining unit employees. These contracts bind both
sides with agreements subject to interpretation by third parties outside
Department of Defense and Air Force; for example, the Federal Labor Relations
Authority and/or arbitrators. Contracts do not cover pay, benefits, or other
matters governed by Federal laws and government-wide regulations. However,
revised Air Force instructions that differ from provisions in a contract may
need to be negotiated. In recent years, civilian performance appraisal changes
were not implemented at some installations until conclusion of lengthy
negotiations between management and unions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.61. Dispute Resolution:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.61.1. Civilian
employees have a variety of avenues to resolve disputes. Labor-management
contracts must include a negotiated grievance procedure that must be used by
members of the bargaining unit. Most start with an option to seek resolution
using outside neutral facilitators or mediators (alternative dispute
resolution). Formal grievances follow two or more steps before one side decides
to refer the dispute to a paid, outside arbitrator. Costs are usually shared
equally by the union and management, so union decisions to pursue arbitration
are not routine. Subject to challenge on points of law or contract terms,
arbitrators' decisions are final.</span></p>

<p><span>15.61.2.
Supervisors, managers, and employees who are not covered by a collective
bargaining agreement, or who are not members of the bargaining unit follow
different grievance procedures. AFI 36-1203,&nbsp;<i>Administrative Grievance
System,</i>covers the administrative grievance process. Administrative
grievances are decided by Air Force officials, usually the installation
commander or designee, although outside fact finders may be used at
management's option.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>15.61.3. A number
of personnel decisions, for example, nonselection for promotion and performance
recognition, are excluded from administrative grievances and most negotiated
grievance procedures. Appeals of adverse actions covered by legal appeal rights
are also excluded from the administrative grievance system. The Merit System
Protection Board hears appeals of suspensions without pay of more than 14 days,
demotions (change to lower grade), and removals. Disputes pursued as grievances
cannot be duplicated as equal employment opportunity complaints and vice versa.
Appeals of adverse actions that include allegations of discrimination may be
reviewed by both Merit System Protection Board and the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.</span></p>

<p><span>15.61.4. A
different route is taken to resolve union/management disputes concerning the
statutory rights of either party. The Federal Labor Relations Authority
investigates charges of unfair labor practice brought by either union or
management. The union files most unfair labor practice charges when managers or
supervisors are accused of changing working conditions or calling formal
meetings without proper notice to the union. If found guilty, management may be
required to revert back to the previous working condition, and the organization
commander, including a wing commander, can be required to post an admission of
managements wrong doing on official base bulletin boards.</span></p>

<p><b><span>15.62. Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>15.62.1. The Air
Force mission requires military members to be prepared for service at all
times. Force support organizations ensure Airmen's families are cared for, pay
and entitlements are properly addressed, and their individual rights are
secure. This chapter included information on enlisted assignments, family care,
reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel
records and individual rights, the awards and decorations program, and the
Airman Promotion system.</span></p>

<p><span>15.62.2. This
chapter continued with the Senior NCOs Promotion Program, identifying how
manpower requirements are quantified and how supervisors initiate changes, and
using competitive sourcing to maximize cost-effectiveness, efficiency and
enhance mission capability by taking advantage of services available through
the private commercial sector. This chapter also introduced civilian personnel
management, covering such areas as job descriptions, filling positions,
training, performance, conduct, and discipline; and working conditions, equal
employment opportunity working conditions, and unions. Senior NCOs require a
basic understanding of the subject areas to effectively lead.</span></p>

assist them along in their career. Air Force Portal, entitlements, legal services,
ground safety along with risk management, and the procedures for prevention of
and response to sexual assault are some of the topics covered. The chapter
serves as a great guide to assist you if you shall ever need information on any
of these topics. More importantly though, as you become supervisor, mentor or
friend having a working knowledge of topics covered in this chapter is vital to
helping you be a great Wingman.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 16B Air Force
Portal</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>16.2. Air Force Portal Simplifies Access:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.2.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>In
2000, the United States Air Force launched the Air Force Portal to simplify
access to information. The mission of the Air Force Portal is to provide ready
access to the latest Air Force information, services, and combat support
applications. Since first introduced, the Air Force Portal has changed the way
we do business. Every day this technology helps us connect, collaborate, and
perform our duties in service to our nation. Access is available anytime,
anywhere, from any Internet-connected computer whether at home, at the office,
or deployed with a valid Department of Defense public key infrastructure
certificate, such as a common access card.</span></p>

<p><span>16.2.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
Air Force Portal provides a single point of entry to Web-based information,
self-service applications, collaboration and networking tools, and combat
support systems, many without requiring a separate user identification and
password. Users have access to key applications like total force awareness
training, myPay, Air Force virtual education center, Air Force fitness
management system, virtual military personnel flight, LeaveWeb, Training
Business Area, Enterprise-Solution-Supply and many more. On the library page,
you can access online periodicals, do research, and find valuable education and
training materials. The Portal is the entry point to the Global Combat Support
System Air Force. The goal of Global Combat Support System Air Force is to
provide timely, accurate, and trusted combat support information to joint and
Air Force commanders at all echelons.</span></p>

<p><span>16.2.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Tremendous
growth continues, with the number of active registered Air Force and Department
of Defense users now over 725,000, with over 400,000 average logins per week,
and serving millions of web pages per day. Provides one location for all areas information,
collaboration, and applications so you can do your job, manage your career, and
live your life in the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 16C Military
Pay, Allowances, and Entitlements</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>16.3. Military Pay and Allowances.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Department
of Defense 7000.14-R, Volume 7A,&nbsp;<i>Military Pay Policy Active Duty and
Reserve Pay,&nbsp;</i>The Joint Travel Regulation and Air Force Manual 65-116,
Volume 1,&nbsp;<i>Defense Joint Military Pay System Active Component FSO
Procedures</i>, contain guidance on pay and allowances and related
entitlements.</span></p>

<p><span>16.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Military (Basic) Pay:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.3.1.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Basic
pay is the fundamental component of military pay and typically, the largest
component of a member's pay. Every member is entitled to basic pay while on
Regular Air Force, with some exceptions such as: during periods of unauthorized
absence, excess leave, or after an enlistment expires. Annual military pay
raises are set by Congress and the President in the National Defense
Authorization Act. In accordance with Federal Law (37 United States Code 1009)
the January 1 annual pay raise will automatically match the private sector wage
increases, as measured by the Employment Cost Index for the previous year. If,
because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the
general welfare, the President may submit a plan to Congress requesting a lower
annual pay raise.</span></p>

<p><span>16.3.1.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Grade
and length of military service determine the actual rate of basic pay. Military
pay date is important because this date determines the length of service for
pay purposes. In general, the pay date should be the same date the individual
entered on Regular Air Force if he or she had no prior service before entering
the Air Force. However, if the individual previously served in certain
governmental agencies the Air Force adjusts the pay date to reflect credit for
these periods. Periods of absence without leave, desertion, and sickness or
injury due to personal misconduct will result in negative pay date adjustments.</span></p>



<p><span>16.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Leave and Earnings Statement.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Defense
Finance and Accounting Service Form 702,&nbsp;<i>Defense Finance and Accounting
Service Military Leave and Earnings Statement</i>, is a comprehensive statement
of a member's entitlements, deductions, allotments, leave information,
tax-withholding information, and Traditional Thrift Savings Plan and the Roth
Thrift Savings Plan information. Verify and keep your leave and earnings
statement each month with increased attention when returning from deployment or
when making changes such as marriage, divorce, or birth of a child. If your pay
varies significantly and you don t understand why or if you have any questions,
consult your servicing finance office. The myPay system allows members to view
their leave and earnings statement as well as initiate changes to selected
items affecting their pay.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.4. Military Allowances and Entitlements.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Allowances
are monies provided for specific needs such as food or housing. Monetary
allowances are provided when the government does not provide for that specific
need. For example, the quantity of government housing is not sufficient to
house all military members and their families. Those who live in government
housing do not receive full housing allowances. Those who do not live in
government housing receive allowances to assist with the cost of obtaining
commercial housing. The most common allowances are basic allowance for
subsistence and basic allowance for housing. Most members receive both of these
allowances, and in many cases, these allowances comprise a significant portion
of the member's total pay. Other than continental United States cost-of-living
allowance, allowances are not taxable, which is an additional embedded benefit
of military pay.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Basic Allowance for Subsistence.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Basic
allowance for subsistence is a nontaxable allowance used to offset the cost of
the service member's meals. Most junior grade enlisted members assigned to
single-type government quarters at their permanent duty station are required to
eat in the government dining facilities, receive basic allowance for subsistence,
and are charged the discounted meal rate which is deducted from their pay. When
certified by the commanding officer or designee, members are allowed to claim
reimbursement for missed meals.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Housing
Allowances.&nbsp;</b>Housing allowances are based on member's grade, dependency
status, and duty location. The location determines whether the allowance is
basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance. In some cases,
members who are not able to take their families to the permanent duty station
are eligible for payment of family separation housing allowance in addition to
basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Basic
Allowance for Housing.</b>&nbsp;The intent of basic allowance for housing is to
provide uniformed service members accurate and equitable housing compensation
based on housing costs in local civilian housing markets. This allowance is
payable when government quarters are not provided. Many Air Force installations
have privatized their quarters, meaning that private contractors have taken
over much of the previously Air Force-owned-andoperated family housing. Members
in these privatized quarters are entitled to basic allowance for housing, and
the rental agreement requires a rent amount not to exceed the basic allowance
for housing entitlement paid via allotment. Members without dependents residing
in government single-type quarters are entitled to partial basic allowance for
housing unless the quarters (including government-leased quarters) exceed the
minimum standards of single quarters for their grade. Members living in
single-type government quarters who pay court-ordered child support may qualify
for differential (basic allowance for housing-Differential). The leave and
earning statement displays the basic allowance for housing rate below the
heading ENTITLEMENTS, listed as basic allowance for housing. The PAY DATA
portion of the leave and earning statement shows the basic allowance for
housing type and basic allowance for housing dependents, as well as other housing-related
data.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Overseas
Housing Allowance.</b>&nbsp;Overseas housing allowance is a cost
reimbursement-based allowance to help defray housing costs incident to
assignments to a permanent duty station outside the United States. Members are
reimbursed actual rental costs not to exceed the maximum overseas housing
allowance rate for each locality, grade, and dependency status. There are two
types of allowances paid under overseas housing allowance: move-in housing
allowance and monthly overseas housing allowance including a utility/recurring
maintenance allowance.</span></p>

<p><span>The
location move-in housing allowance (for those who qualify) is based on the
average  move-in  costs for members. The monthly overseas housing allowance is
the rent, up to the rental allowance at a permanent duty station, plus the
utility/recurring maintenance allowance.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Family
Separation Housing.</b>&nbsp;The purpose of family separation housing is to pay
a member for added housing expenses resulting from enforced separation from
dependents. There are two types of family separation housing: family separation
housing  basic allowance for housing and family separation housing-overseas
housing allowance. Family separation housing  basic allowance for housing is
payable in a monthly amount equal to the without-dependent basic allowance for
housing rate applicable to the member's grade and permanent duty station.
Family separation housing-overseas housing allowance is payable in a monthly
amount up to the without-dependent overseas housing allowance rate applicable
to the member's grade and permanent duty station. For additional guidance,
consult the Joint Travel Regulation at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm"><span>http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm</span></a><a href="http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/travelreg.cfm"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><span>16.4.3.<b>&nbsp;Clothing Replacement Allowance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Enlisted
military members receive an annual allowance to help maintain, repair, and
replace initial issue uniform items as necessary. There are two types of
clothing replacement allowance: clothing replacement allowance Basic, a
preliminary replacement allowance paid annually between the 6th and 36th month
of Regular Air Force; and clothing replacement allowance Standard, an allowance
that automatically replaces clothing replacement allowance Basic after 36
months of Regular Air Force. Entitlement to either allowance depends on the
individual's  entered on Regular Air Force date  in his or her master military
pay account. This allowance is paid at the end of the member's anniversary
month and appears on the leave and earning statement opposite CLOTHING under
the ENTITLEMENTS heading.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.4.<b>&nbsp;Family Separation Allowance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Family
separation allowance is a type of allowance payable to members with dependents
in addition to any other allowance or per diem to which a member may be
entitled. Family separation allowance has three different categories: family
separation allowance-restricted, family separation allowance-serving on ships,
and family separation allowance-temporary. A member may not receive more than
one payment of family separation allowance for the same period, even though
qualified for family separation allowance-restricted and family separation
allowance-serving on ships or family separation allowance-temporary. The
purpose of family separation allowance is to compensate qualified members for
added expenses incurred because of an enforced family separation. Members are
eligible for family separation allowance-restricted if transportation of
dependents, including dependents acquired after effective date of orders, is
not authorized at government expense, and the dependents do not live in the
vicinity of the member's permanent duty station. Family separation
allowance-serving on ships applies to members serving on ships away from the
homeport continuously for more than 30 days. A member is eligible for family
separation allowance-temporary if the member is on temporary duty away from the
permanent station continuously for more than 30 days, and the member's dependents
are not residing at or near the temporary duty station. This includes members
required to perform a period of the temporary duty before reporting to their
initial station of assignment.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.5.<b>&nbsp;Station Allowances outside the
Continental United States.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
aim of overseas station allowances is to help defray the higher than normal
cost of living or cost in procuring housing in overseas areas. Allowances the
Department of Defense authorizes only at certain overseas locations include
temporary lodging allowance and cost-of-living allowance. Members receive
information regarding their specific entitlements during in-processing at the
new location. Members may also receive information from their local finance
office upon notification of a pending overseas assignment.</span></p>

<p><span>16.4.6.&nbsp;<b>Continental United States
Cost-of-Living Allowance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Continental Unites
States cost-of-living allowance is payable to members assigned to designated
 high cost  areas within the continental Unites States. For additional information,
see Joint Travel Regulation, chapter 8.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.5. Special and Incentive Pay.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A
number of special and incentive pays recognize certain aspects of duty,
including, but not limited to hazardous duty incentive pay, imminent danger
pay, special duty assignment pay, enlisted flying duty incentive pay, and
hardship duty pay-location. Also included are enlistment and reenlistment
bonuses.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.6. Deductions.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The two general
categories of payroll deductions are involuntary and voluntary deductions.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.<b>&nbsp;Involuntary Deductions:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Withholding Income Tax:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.1.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Department
of Defense 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 44, outlines specific taxable and
nontaxable items. All  pay  is considered income for federal and state income
tax purposes (for example, basic pay, incentive pay, special pay, lump-sum
payment of accrued leave, and separation pay). Allowances considered nontaxable
on 9 September 1986 remain nontaxable. For example, basic allowance for
subsistence remains nontaxable and continental United States cost-of-living
allowance is taxable.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.1.2. The leave
and earning statement reflects the current month and year-to-date income for
social security, federal income tax, and state income tax purposes under the
headings  FICA TAXES,   FED TAXES,  and  STATE TAXEs' in the middle of the
form. Defense Finance and Accounting Service is responsible for ensuring the
leave and earning statement provides the necessary pay and entitlement
information.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Federal
Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) Taxes.&nbsp;</b>The FICA requires federal
agencies to withhold FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes from the basic
pay of military members covered by the Social Security Act and to pay matching
FICA taxes to the Social Security Administration.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Federal
Income Tax Withholding (FITW).&nbsp;</b>FITW is used to provide for national
programs such as defense, community development, and law enforcement. The FITW
complies with the Treasury Department Circular E as implemented in military
service directives. A member may authorize an additional monthly amount of
FITW.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.4.<b>&nbsp;State
Income Tax Withholding (SITW).&nbsp;</b>The tax laws of the state where the
member is a legal resident determine whether the member must pay state taxes.
The amount withheld depends upon the state tax rate. Onetime payments may also
be subject to state tax. The state for tax purposes is reflected in the first
column on the leave and earning statement under STATE TAXES.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.1.5.<b>&nbsp;Armed
Forces Retirement Home (AFRH).&nbsp;</b>Monthly deductions from the pay of
regular enlisted members, up to a maximum of $1, are set by the Secretary of
Defense after consulting with the AFRH Board. The money helps support the
United States Soldiers , Airmen's and Naval Homes.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.2.<b>&nbsp;Voluntary Deductions:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.6.2.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Military
members may establish voluntary deductions such as allotments to help
administer their personal finances. Effective January 1, 2015, members are not
authorized to start allotments for the purchase, lease, or rental of personal
property. Personal property includes vehicles (e.g., automobiles, motorcycles,
or boats), appliances or household goods (e.g., a washer, dryer, furniture),
electronics (e.g., laptop, tablet, cellphone, or television), and other
consumer items that are tangible and movable. Members may also have an allotment
for a personal savings program, support of family members, and payment of
insurance premiums. Members may control certain discretionary allotments
through myPay however, there can be no more than one discretionary allotment to
the same allottee. Nondiscretionary allotments have limited uses, such as
charitable contributions, loan repayment to the Air Force Aid Society,
garnishment for commercial debts, and delinquent travel charge card debt.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.2.2. To allow for sufficient processing
time, allotments should be requested about 30 days before the desired month.
Occasionally, an allotment transaction may occur after the cutoff date for the
mid-month payday. This will result in the entire amount of the allotment being
deducted from the end-of-month pay. Normally, if the member is paid twice a
month, the allotment is deducted in equal amounts from the mid-month and
end-of-month pay. If the individual receives pay once a month, the entire
amount is deducted from the monthly paycheck. There are certain cutoff dates
that affect when allotments can be processed. Contact your local finance office
for assistance.</span></p>

<p><span>16.6.2.3.
The maximum amount of service members' Group Life Insurance coverage is
$400,000 and members are covered, by law, at the maximum rate unless they
decline or reduce coverage. Service members' Group Life Insurance automatically
insures an eligible member against death when the member is performing Regular
Air Force or Regular Air Force for training for an ordered period of more than
30 days. However, an individual may choose less coverage in amounts divisible
by $50,000 or elect no coverage, but he or she must do so in writing.
Additionally, family service members' Group Life Insurance covers spouses and
dependent children when the eligible member also participates in Service
members' Group Life Insurance coverage, including military spouses. There is a
monthly deduction for spousal coverage: the amount of the deduction depends on
the amount of coverage. Each child is covered in the amount of $10,000 at no
cost to the member. The member may not elect to insure any child for less than
$10,000. Service members' Group Life Insurance and Family service members 
Group Life Insurance premiums are deducted from members' military pay each
month. The military personnel section is the office of primary responsibility
for administering the program.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.7. Military Pay Schedules:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.7.1.&nbsp;<b>Regular Payments.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Military
members are paid on a monthly basis with the option to receive payments once or
twice per month. Members receive a statement (net pay advice) of the net amount
pay and the financial organization to which statement was sent at mid-month (if
receiving a payment) and a comprehensive statement of pay, the leave and
earning statement, at the end of the month via myPay. These statements are
created centrally by Defense Finance and Accounting Service. Military members
must understand the pay system has processing cutoff dates that affect updates
to their pay. The cutoff date is the day when Defense Finance and Accounting
Service stops processing transactions against pay accounts for the current
period so the regular payroll process can begin. The cutoff is necessary to
compute, prepare, and transfer funds. While the cutoff dates fluctuate from
month to month, they are generally around the 6th for the mid-month payday and
the 20th for the end-of-month payday.</span></p>

<p><span>16.7.2.<b>&nbsp;Local, Partial, and Emergency
Partial Payments.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Local
cash payments are normally only authorized for overseas areas where on base
military banking facilities are not readily available. Exceptions may be
granted for members assigned to classified or contingency operations where the
exigencies of their assignments may require local cash or partial payments.
Under extenuating circumstances, a stateside member may receive an emergency
partial payment if the payment is deemed time sensitive and required within 24
hours due to an unforeseen set of circumstances. The member's commander may
authorize immediate cash payments up to the amount of accrued entitlement to
date when deemed appropriate to the mission. Non-cash partial payments may be
made, via electronic funds transfer and deposited into the member's financial
institution, normally in 2 to 3 business days. Partial payments are limited to
the amount of pay and allowances the member has accrued to the date of the
payment. Partial payments are recouped in full on the next available payday.</span></p>

<p><span>16.7.3.<b>&nbsp;Permanent Change of Station
Advance Payments.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Advance
payments of pay and allowances provide members with funds to meet extraordinary
expenses incident to a government-ordered relocation that are directly related
to the permanent change of station and not covered by other entitlements. A
permanent change of station advance payment is an advance of up to 3 months of
basic pay, less the mandatory deductions of FICA, FITW, SITW, Air Force
Retirement Home, and all known debts currently being deducted. Airman First
Class and below must have the approval of their immediate commander for advance
pay. If the desired repayment period is greater than 12 months or the amount
requested is greater than 1 month's basic pay, then all members must have the
approval of their immediate commander. Repayment periods greater than 12 months
are only approved in cases of financial hardship.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Individual
billed account government travel charge card usage is authorized and highly
encouraged for all permanent change of station related expenses.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.8. Permanent Change of Station Allowances:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.8.1.<b>&nbsp;Transportation Allowance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When military members
are ordered to perform a permanent change of station, they may receive a
variety of travel allowances. Some of these allowances include:</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Government-Procured
Transportation.&nbsp;</b>Available United States-certificated air carriers must
be used for all commercial air transportation of persons/property when the
government funds the air travel. When the authorizing/order-issuing official
determines United States-certificated air carriers are unavailable, commercial
air transportation on a non-United States-certificated air carrier may be
authorized/approved. Documentation explaining why United States-certificated
air carrier service is not available must be provided to the traveler.
Endorsements on the travel orders or government travel procurement document
made in accordance with service guidance are acceptable. Travel time for travel
by government conveyance (except government automobile) or common carriers
obtained by government-procured transportation is allowed for the actual time
needed to travel over the direct route including necessary delays for the
transportation mode used.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Use of
Privately Owned Conveyance.&nbsp;</b>Uniformed service policy is to
authorize/approve (as distinguished from permit) privately owned conveyance
travel if acceptable to the member and advantageous to the government based on
the facts in each case. Other allowable travel and transportation options
include government conveyance or commercial carrier. Reimbursement of parking
fees, ferry fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls is authorized for privately
owned conveyance over the most direct route between the stations involved. The
member is also authorized a flat per diem at the standard continental United
States rate for each permanent change of station travel day between authorized
points, up to the allowable travel time.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Personally
Procured Transportation.&nbsp;</b>Department of Defense policy mandates the use
of the commercial travel office for all official transportation requirements. A
member who, despite the Department of Defense policy, procures common carrier
transportation at personal expense for official travel is authorized
reimbursement (except transoceanic travel in which no reimbursement is
authorized) up to the amount authorized. However, reimbursement must not exceed
the cost for the authorized transportation and accommodations over a usually
traveled direct route according to a schedule necessary to meet the
requirements of the order. Commands/units are expected to take appropriate
disciplinary action when a member and (or) an authorizing/order-issuing
official fail to follow the regulations concerning commercial travel office
use. Consult the Joint Travel Regulation for additional information.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.1.4.<b>&nbsp;Mixed
Modes.</b>&nbsp;When both government-procured and personally procured modes of
transportation are used, the Air Force uses a combination of rules governed by
the Joint Travel Regulation. The local Financial Service Office can provide
specific guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.2.<b>&nbsp;Dependent Travel.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
military member receives monetary allowance in lieu of transportation and flat
rate per diem for the official distance dependents travel with him or her by
privately owned vehicle. If dependents purchase commercial common carrier
transportation, the member may be reimbursed for the actual cost of the
transportation, not to exceed the cost the government would have incurred for
ordered travel, and the member receives a per diem allowance for dependents.
When the Air Force restricts travel of dependents to a location overseas, dependents
may move at government expense to any place (called the Designated Location,
which must be approved and listed on the permanent change of station
authorization) within the continental United States the member designates. With
special approval, dependents may move outside the continental United States.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.3.<b>&nbsp;Dislocation Allowance<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>This
allowance is paid at a rate determined by the Secretary of Defense and payable
to all members with dependents when dependents relocate their household goods
in conjunction with a permanent change of station. It is also payable to
members without dependents if they are not assigned permanent government
quarters upon arrival at the new permanent duty station.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.4.<b>&nbsp;Temporary Lodging Expense and
Temporary Lodging Allowance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
member arriving or departing permanent change of station at a location within
the continental United States may receive temporary lodging expense<b>&nbsp;</b>to
help defray the added living expenses incurred while occupying temporary
lodging. A member arriving or departing permanent change of station at a
location outside the continental United States may receive temporary lodging
allowance<b>&nbsp;</b>to help defray the added living expenses incurred while
occupying temporary lodging. Temporary lodging expense is paid on a travel
voucher. Temporary lodging allowance is paid in military pay and is reflected
on the leave and earning statement.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.5.<b>&nbsp;Shipment of Household Goods.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
member ordered on a permanent change of station move may ship household goods<b>&nbsp;</b>within
certain weight limitations at government expense. Authorized weight allowances
normally depend on the grade of the member and whether he or she has
dependents. A member may be reimbursed for personally arranging for the
shipment of household goods. Claims should be prepared and submitted according
to service instructions. The government's cost limit is based on the member s
maximum household goods weight allowance (that is, if the member transports
household goods in excess of the authorized weight allowance, all payments are
based on the authorized weight allowance).</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.6.<b>&nbsp;Shipment of Unaccompanied
Baggage.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This
provision refers to the portion of the permanent change of station weight
allowance ordinarily transported separately from the major or bulk of household
goods and usually is transported by an expedited mode. When the expedited
transportation mode is commercial air, a maximum of 1,000 pounds (net), may be
transported.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.7.<b>&nbsp;Shipment of Privately Owned
Vehicle.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When authorized, members
may ship one privately owned vehicle at government expense when ordered to go
on a permanent change of station to, from, or between locations overseas.
Privately owned vehicle storage may be provided or authorized for personally
arranging when shipment is prohibited or restricted.</span></p>

<p><span>16.8.8.<b>&nbsp;Mobile Home Shipment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Members
who own a mobile home should contact the traffic management office to arrange
transportation. In certain circumstances, members may arrange or contract
personally for the movement of the mobile home. Shipment of a mobile home is in
lieu of household goods transportation.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.9. Temporary Duty Entitlements:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.9.1.<b>&nbsp;Per Diem.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This
allowance helps defray the cost of quarters, meals, and certain incidentals,
Per diem rates depend on the temporary duty location. Travelers are paid a
prescribed amount for meals and incidental expenses plus the actual amount for
lodging, not to exceed the maximum lodging rate for the specific location. The
rates depend on the availability of government facilities, such as quarters and
dining facilities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Transportation<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>Policy mandates that uniformed service members use available
commercial travel offices to arrange official travel. The mode of
transportation used between the points designated in the travel order will
determine the transportation entitlement. On the other hand, if the member
receives authorization to travel at personal expense, he or she will receive a
reimbursement limited to what cost the government would have incurred for the
authorized mode of travel.</span></p>

<p><span>Consult the
transportation office or commercial travel office for assistance.</span></p>

<p><span>16.9.3.<b>&nbsp;Miscellaneous Reimbursable
Expenses.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Reimbursable
travel related expenses include travel from home or place of lodging to the
servicing transportation terminal by taxi, limousine, bus, or privately owned
vehicle; passports, and visas; and rental vehicles when authorized on travel
orders.</span></p>

<p><span>16.9.4.<b>&nbsp;Temporary Duty Expenses:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.9.4.1.
When the temporary duty is completed, the traveler is responsible for
electronically filing a voucher (Defense Travel System) or preparing his or her
DD Form 1351-2,&nbsp;<i>Travel Voucher or Subvoucher</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>to claim
reimbursement for official travel within 5 business days upon return to
permanent duty station. The traveler is responsible for the truth and accuracy
of the information. When the traveler signs the form (and this signature
authority must never be delegated), he or she attests that the statements are
true and complete and that he or she is aware of the liability for filing a
false claim. All claims and attached statements shall be completed using ink,
typewriter, or computer-generated forms. The member is expected to pay the
amount billed from the government travel charge card company upon receipt of the
monthly statement.</span></p>

<p><span>16.9.4.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Electronic
funds transfer is the mandatory means by which a travel claim is settled. The
split disbursement option in Defense Travel System, which permits direct
payment via electronic funds transfer to the government travel charge card
contractor for charges incurred on the individual billed account government
travel charge card and to the cardholder for any residual amount will be
utilized. Spilt disbursement enables travelers to elect the amount of money to
be forwarded to the government travel charge card contractor. In cases where
the traveler is temporary duty for 45 days or more, he or she shall file an
interim voucher (or have scheduled partial payments setup in Defense Travel
System) every 30 days and use split disbursement to pay the bill. An extended
temporary duty trip is no excuse for late payment of the government travel
charge card bill.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.10. The Government Travel Charge Card
Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.10.1.<b>&nbsp;Purpose.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
travel card program is intended to facilitate and standardize the use by
Department of Defense travelers of a safe, effective, convenient, commercially
available method to pay for expenses incident to official travel, including
local travel. The travel card is used to improve Department of Defense cash management,
reduce Department of Defense and traveler administrative workloads, and
facilitate better service to Department of Defense travelers. In addition,
because of the refund feature of the travel card program, the program results
in cost savings for the Department.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.2.<b>&nbsp;Agency Program Coordinators.</b></span></p>

<p><span>An
agency program coordinator is an individual (uniformed member, employee,
contractor, or foreign national) designated in writing by a commander or
director as responsible for the management of the travel card program. Agency
program coordinators are responsible to manage the travel card program within
their hierarchy in accordance with Department of Defense Financial Management
Regulation, Volume 9, Chapter 3 and understand policies and procedures set forth
in the Air Force government travel charge card guide, and the Department of
Defense Financial Management Regulation.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.3.<b>&nbsp;Card Use.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Unless
otherwise exempted, all Department of Defense personnel are required to use the
government-sponsored, contractor-issued government travel charge card for all
expenses arising from official government travel. These expenses include
lodging, transportation expenses, local ground transportation, and rental car
expenses authorized on travel orders. The cardholder, while in a travel status,
may use the card for nonreimbursable incidental travel expenses such as rental
movies, personal telephone calls, exercise fees, and beverages when these
charges are not part of a separate room billing or meal and are reasonable.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.3.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Government
travel charge cardholders obtain cash, as authorized, through automated teller
machines, rather than obtaining cash advances from a Department of Defense
disbursing officer.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.3.2.
Travelers may use the government travel charge card at a specified network of
automated teller machine to obtain cash needed to pay for  out-of-pocket 
travel-related expenses. The travel card vendor assigns a personal
identification number to each cardholder, together with card issuance to permit
automated teller machine access. Automated teller machine advances will not be
obtained earlier than 3 working days before scheduled travel and are limited to
authorized expenses exempt from mandatory card usage (meals, incidentals,
miscellaneous expenses, etc.). The travel card vendor will charge the
cardholder a transaction fee for automated teller machine use. This includes
international transaction fees made as a result of any foreign currency
conversion. These charges, which appear on the cardholder's billing statement,
are typically part of the incidental expense portion of per diem and are
therefore no longer separate reimbursable expenses. In addition, some banks
charge a service fee for automated teller machine access. This fee is also part
of the incidental expense portion of per diem and are no longer reimbursable.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.4.<b>&nbsp;Card Abuse<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>Commanders
or supervisors will not tolerate the misuse of the Department of Defense
government travel charge card. Cardholders who misuse their Department of
Defense government travel charge card are subject to appropriate administrative
or disciplinary action. The cardholder will only use the government travel
charge card while in official travel status.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.5.<b>&nbsp;How to Pay the Card Company<i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p><span>The
travel card vendor provides detailed monthly bills. Cardholders are responsible
for payment in full of outstanding balances due in the monthly billing
statement from the travel card vendor. Payments should be made promptly (within
the current billing cycle). Military service members who travel temporary duty
and use government credit cards must use the split disbursement feature within
Defense Travel System, which automatically pays the credit card vendor for
credit card charges while on official travel. Cardholders must designate the
total outstanding balance incurred while traveling as split-disbursement when
filing their vouchers. A late fee per billing cycle may be assessed for
individually billed accounts that are 75 days past the closing date of the
account statement on which the charges first appeared.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.6.<b>&nbsp;Travel Card Considerations
during a Permanent Change of Station.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Individuals
are required to use the government travel charge card during a permanent change
of station. Credit limit increases and deferred payment options are available
to accommodate the extended travel times of a permanent change of station move.
The individual is still responsible for keeping the bill current while in a
permanent change of station status. The cardholder must notify the losing
agency program coordinator before departing the old duty station and gaining
agency program coordinator upon reporting to the new duty station. The losing
agency program coordinator will update the travel card account to  mission
critical  status and set a future date in the travel card company's Electronic
Access System to deactivate the cardholder's account based on permanent change
of station travel order report no later than date. The agency program
coordinator will also submit a transfer request to the travel card vendor so
the individual is removed from that unit's reporting hierarchy level. The
gaining agency program coordinator will ensure the transfer request is
processed by the travel card vendor when the member arrives so the account
information can be updated. The gaining agency program coordinator will also
clear the deactivation date within the travel card vendor's Electronic Access
System.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.7.<b>&nbsp;Delinquencies:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.10.7.1.
Cardholders are responsible for payment in full of the amount stated on the
monthly billing statement. The travel card vendor will submit to Defense
Finance and Accounting Service accounts that are 126 days past due for
Salary-offset processing. The travel card vendor may also initiate pay
garnishment proceedings through the judicial system against cardholder accounts
over 126 days delinquent. Upon written request of the travel card vendor,
Department of Defense may act on their behalf and collect by payroll deduction
from the amount of pay owed to the cardholder any funds the cardholder owes to
the travel charge card vendor as a result of delinquencies not disputed by the
cardholder on the government travel charge card.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.7.2.
If the travel card vendor cannot initiate pay garnishment proceedings and the
cardholder account is over 210 days delinquent, the travel card vendor will
charge off the account and report the delinquency to the credit bureau. The
debt will then be collected through a third party collection agency assigned by
the travel card vendor.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.8.<b>&nbsp;Collection of Debts:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.10.8.1.<b>&nbsp;Debts
to the Federal Government.&nbsp;</b>An Air Force member who owes debts to the
federal government or instrumentalities of the government does not have to give
his or her consent for the Air Force to collect. Generally, for debts that
exceed $100, the individual must be given due process (that is, the individual
must receive notification of the pending collection of a debt and be given a
chance to repay the debt before any withholding action occurs). However, due
process need not be completed before the start of a collection action if an
individual's estimated date of separation is not sufficient to complete
collection and the Air Force would be unlikely to collect the debt. Due process
may not apply when the collection action can be completed within two monthly
pay periods. The Air Force may also collect debts involving any federal agency,
portions of a reenlistment bonus not served, delinquent hospital bills for
family members, excess shipment of household goods, loss or damage to
government property, and erroneous payments made to or on behalf of the member
by the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.8.2.<b>&nbsp;Waiver
and Remission Provisions.&nbsp;</b>Military members may request relief from
valid debts by applying for waiver or remission of the debt. The local
financial services office has specific guidance and can provide assistance
regarding these programs.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.8.3.<b>&nbsp;Waiver
of Claims for Erroneous Payments of Pay and Allowances.&nbsp;</b>When a member
receives erroneous pay or allowances, he or she may apply for a waiver of
claims by the United States. A waiver may be granted when there is no
indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the
part of the member or any other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver
of the claim. Defense Finance and Accounting Service will rule on all waivers.
When filing for a waiver, the collection of the indebtedness must be started.</span></p>

<p><span>16.10.8.4.&nbsp;<b>Remission.</b>&nbsp;A
Regular Air Force or separated member, or his or her commander, may apply for
remission of a member's indebtedness to the United States. The Air Force may
not remit or cancel any debt due to noncollection of court-martial forfeiture.
In addition to the circumstances creating the debt and the issue of good faith
on the part of the member, financial hardship may be a factor for
consideration.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.11. The United States Air Force Uniformed
Thrift Savings Plan:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.11.1.<b>&nbsp;Purpose.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Thrift Savings Plan
is a retirement savings and investment plan established for federal employees
as part of the</span></p>

<p><span>Federal
Employees' Retirement Act of 1986. Participation in the plan for uniformed
service members is authorized by law. The plan offers Traditional Thrift Saving
Plan, tax-deferred advantages similar to those in an individual retirement
account or 401(k) plan. Traditional Thrift Saving Plan contributions can be
taken out of pay before taxes are computed; as a result, individual tax
obligations are reduced. Roth contributions are taken out of your paycheck
after your income is taxed. When you withdraw your funds at a future date, your
contributions will be tax-free since you already paid taxes on the
contributions.</span></p>

<p><span>16.11.2.<b>&nbsp;Participating in the
Traditional and Roth Thrift Saving Plan.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
member is authorized to contribute from 1 to 92 percent of their basic pay.
Members are not permitted to contribute more than 92 percent of their basic pay
so that required deductions of Social Security and Medicare can be made. If a
member is contributing to the Thrift Saving Plan from basic pay, the member is
also authorized to contribute bonuses, incentive, or special pay.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>As of January 2017, the maximum Thrift Savings Plan contribution
amount for 2017 is $18,000 for deferred and Roth contributions and up to
$54,000 total combined deferred/exempt Traditional and Roth contributions. The
amounts contributed to the traditional and Roth Thrift Savings Plan must be
stated as a whole percent. Members have the ability to manage their Thrift
Savings Plan via myPay; those requiring customer assistance for Thrift Savings
Plan pay-related questions, leave and earning statement interpretations, and
financial issues may contact their financial service office.</span></p>

<p><span>16.11.3.<b>&nbsp;Education and Awareness.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Personal Financial
Readiness is a core service of the Airman and Family Readiness Center and they
offer information, education, and personal financial counseling to help
individuals and families maintain financial stability and reach their financial
goals.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 16D Leave
Management</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>16.12. Policy.</span></b></p>

<p><span>As
stated in AFI 36-3003,&nbsp;<i>Military Leave Program</i>, lengthy respites
from the work environment tend to have a beneficial effect on an individual s
psychological and physical status. Therefore, an effective leave program is an
essential military requirement. According to Department of Defense Instruction
1327.6,&nbsp;<i>Leave and Liberty Policy and Procedures</i>, all officers in
command, major headquarters, and the military departments shall ensure that
secondary and nonessential efforts, though desirable in themselves, do no
prevent an effective leave program.</span></p>





<p><b><span>16.13. Accruing Leave.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force can pay members for unused leave at certain points in their careers,
such as reenlistment, retirement, separation under honorable conditions, or
death. By law, members may receive accrued leave payment up to a maximum of 60
days during their military careers. However, the department of Defense policy
expresses Congressional concern that members use leave to relax from the
pressures of duties and not as a method of compensation.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Members
do not earn leave when they are absent without official leave, in an
unauthorized leave status, in confinement as a result of a courtmartial
sentence, in an excess leave status, or on appellate leave under Title 10,
United States Code, Section 876a,&nbsp;<i>Leave Required to Be Taken Pending
Review of Certain Court-Martial Convictions</i>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.14. Special Leave Accrual.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Special
leave accrual earned in combat zones may be kept for 4 fiscal years; special
leave accrual earned in support of operations may now be kept for 2 fiscal
years. An additional one-time special leave accrual sell-back is authorized for
enlisted service members. Under this provision, an enlisted service member may
sell back up to 30 days of special leave accrual. Such a sell back counts
toward the service member's cap of 60 days over a career. This provision has no
termination date. Members lose any leave in excess of 60 days at the end of the
fiscal year unless they are eligible for special leave accrual. Eligible
members who lose leave on 1 October may have only that portion of leave
restored that could not possibly have been used before the end of the fiscal
year not to exceed 120 days. The wing or vice commander has final approval
authority and may be delegated no lower than the first O-6 in the chain of
command. Major command or field operating agency directors of personnel or
equivalents (Colonel or above) will approve special leave accrual for their
organizations. Any commander in the chain of command may deny a member s
request for special leave accrual without referring the member to a
higher-level authority when the request does not meet the criteria for special
leave accrual consideration. Members are eligible for special leave accrual if
any of the following circumstances exist:</span></p>

<p><span>16.14.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>A
member who serves on Regular Air Force while entitled to hostile fire/imminent
danger pay for a continuous period of at least 120 days are authorized to
retain such leave (not to exceed 120 days) until the end of the third fiscal
year following the fiscal year in which the duty assignment in terminated.</span></p>

<p><span>16.14.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Members
assigned to a non-hostile fire and/or non-imminent danger pay area for a
continuous period of at least 120 days are authorized to retain such leave up
to 120 days but not to exceed the total number of continuous days assigned to
the unit or qualifying duty until the end of the second fiscal year in which
the duty assignment is terminated.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.15. Beginning and Ending Leave.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Leave
must begin and end in the local area. The term  local area  means the place of
residence from which the member commutes to the duty station on a daily basis.
This also applies to leave en route to a permanent change of station or
temporary duty assignment. In this case, the local area, as defined at the old
and new permanent duty station, applies. The old permanent duty station is for
beginning leave; the new permanent duty station is for ending leave. Making a
false statement of leave taken may result in punitive action under the Uniform
Code of Military Justice. Regardless of the amount of leave authorized, Finance
calculates leave based on the actual date of departure and date of return.
General rules on charging leave are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span>16.15.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Use
Air Force Form 988,&nbsp;<i>Leave Request/Authorization</i>, for all types of
leave and permissive temporary duty when LeaveWeb cannot be used. (See AFMAN
65-116, Volume 2,&nbsp;<i>Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Unit
Procedures Excluding FSO</i>, Chapter 7, for information concerning LeaveWeb.)
(<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;When members take leave en route with permanent change
of station or temporary duty travel, the financial service office uses the
travel voucher to determine authorized travel and chargeable leave.) Nonduty
days and holidays are chargeable leave days if they occur during an authorized
period of leave. If leave includes a weekend, a member cannot end leave on a
Friday and begin the leave again on Monday. Further, unit commanders will not
approve successive Monday through Friday leaves (or periods of leave
surrounding other nonduty days) except under emergency or unusual circumstances
as determined by the unit commander.</span></p>

<p><span>16.15.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>A
member who is unable to report to duty upon expiration of leave because of
illness or injury must advise the leave approving authority. The next of kin,
attending physician, representative at the nearest medical treatment facility,
or American Red Cross representative may act on the member's behalf when the
member is incapacitated and unable to provide notification. Upon returning from
leave, the member must present a statement from the nearest medical treatment
facility or attending physician regarding the member's medical condition. (<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;The
unit commander evaluates the statement before authenticating the leave
document.) If a member on leave requires hospitalization or quarters status,
leave is not charged while hospitalized or on quarters. Chargeable leave ends
the day before and starts again the day following hospitalization or quarter s
status, regardless of the hour of admission or discharge or release from
quarters. The unit commander issues an amended leave authorization, if
required.</span></p>

<p><span>16.15.3.
The military personnel section and Air Force Personnel Center/DPFCM (Missing
Persons Branch) change the member's leave status to absent without official
leave when the member fails to return to duty at the end of his or her leave period.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.16. Extension of Leave.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
member must ask, orally or in writing, for an extension of leave. The extension
must be requested sufficiently in advance of expiration of leave authorized to
permit the member to return to duty at the proper time if the approval
authority disapproves the extension.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.17. Recall from Leave.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Unit
commanders may recall members from leave for military necessity or in the best
interest of the Air Force. Refer to the joint travel regulation to determine if
travel and transportation allowances apply. If the unit commander authorizes
the member to resume leave after the member completes the duty that resulted in
recall, a new Air Force Form 988 or orders must be prepared.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.18. Types of Leave.</span></b></p>

<p><span>AFI 36-3003 outlines
many types of leave, such as:</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.1.<b>&nbsp;Annual Leave.</b>&nbsp;Another name for
 ordinary  leave is annual leave. Normally, members request leave, as accruing
(earning), within mission requirements. Members use annual leave to take
vacations, attend to parental family needs such as illnesses, celebrate
traditional national holiday periods, attend spiritual events or other
religious observances, or as terminal leave with retirement or separation from
Regular Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.2.<b>&nbsp;Advance</b>&nbsp;<b>Leave.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Advance
leave is leave granted based on a reasonable expectation that a member will
accrue at least that much leave during the remaining period of active military
service. The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to resolve
emergencies or urgent personal situations when they have limited or no accrued
leave. When a member has taken all the advance leave that represents what he or
she will be accruing during the remaining period of active service, unit
commanders change member's leave status from advance to excess leave. The financial
service office stops or collects, if applicable, all pay and allowances paid
after the member's leave status changes from advance to excess leave.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.3.<b>&nbsp;Convalescent Leave.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Convalescent
leave is an authorized absence normally for the minimal time needed to meet the
medical needs for recuperation. Convalescent leave is not chargeable leave.
Unit commanders normally approve convalescent leave based on recommendations by
either the medical treatment facility authority or physician most familiar with
the member's medical condition. When a member elects civilian medical care at
personal expense and an Air Force physician determines the medical procedure as
elective by military medical treatment facility authorities, such as cosmetic
surgery, the member must use ordinary leave for all absences from duty,
including convalescence. When medical authorities determine a medical procedure
is necessary, such as childbirth, and the member elects civilian medical care,
the commander, upon the recommendation by either the medical treatment facility
authority or the attending physician most familiar with the member's medical
condition may grant convalescent leave.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.4.<b>&nbsp;Emergency Leave.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Emergency
leave is chargeable leave granted for personal or family emergencies involving
the immediate family. Unit commanders approve emergency leave; however,
commanders can delegate leave approval to no lower than the first sergeant for
enlisted personnel. Normally, verification by the America Red Cross is not
necessary. However, when the official granting leave has reason to doubt the
validity of an emergency situation, he or she may request assistance from the
military service activity nearest the location of the emergency or, when
necessary, from the American Red Cross. The initial period of emergency leave
is usually for no more than 30 days with possible extensions of an additional
30 days. If the individual needs an extension while on emergency leave, he or
she must contact the unit commander or first sergeant for approval. Unit
commanders should advise members to apply for a humanitarian or exceptional
family member reassignment or hardship discharge if the leave period is more
than 60 days. Air Force Personnel Center approves emergency leave if leave
requested results in a member having a cumulative negative leave balance of
over 30 days. The member may not request emergency leave for reasons such as
attending court hearings or the resolution of marital or financial problems;
the member may, however, request ordinary leave for these situations.
Situations when emergency leave is normally authorized include but are not
limited to:</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.4.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>To
visit a terminally ill person in the immediate family of either the member or
the member's spouse.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.4.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>When
there has been a verified death in the member's immediate family or the
spouse's immediate family.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.4.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Because
the member or someone in the member's or spouse's immediate family has a
life-threatening condition due to an accident, illness, or major surgery or is
admitted to an Intensive Care Unit due to a major illness or accident.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.4.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>Because
the member is affected by a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado,
flood, or earthquake, and a severe or unusual hardship would result if the
member failed to return home.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.5.<b>&nbsp;En Route Leave.</b></span></p>

<p><span>En
route leave is ordinary leave members use in connection with permanent change
of station, including their first change of station upon completion of
technical training. Members may request advance leave when they do not have
enough accrued leave to use as en route leave. Normally, the losing unit
commander approves up to 30 days en route leave with any change of station move
if the leave does not interfere with the reporting date to either a port or new
assignment. Members who complete basic or technical training may request at
least 10 days of leave en route if their first duty station is in the
continental United States. They may request at least 14 days if going to an
overseas assignment.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.6.<b>&nbsp;Terminal Leave.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Terminal
leave is chargeable leave taken in conjunction with retirement or separation
from Regular Air Force. The member's last day of leave coincides with the last
day of Regular Air Force. Normally, a member does not return to duty after
terminal leave begins. The amount of leave taken cannot exceed the leave
balance at the date of separation. See AFI 36-3003 for guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.7.<b>&nbsp;Excess Leave.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Excess
leave is leave members normally use for personal or family emergency situations
when members cannot request advance leave. Excess leave is a no-pay status;
therefore, entitlement to pay and allowances and leave accrual stops on the
member's first day of excess leave. A member will not receive disability pay,
if injured, for time spent on excess leave. The period of excess leave will not
count toward the fulfillment of any Regular Air Force service commitment.</span></p>

<p><span>16.18.8.<b>&nbsp;Environmental and Morale Leave.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Environmental
and morale leave is leave authorized at overseas installations where adverse
environmental conditions require special arrangements for leave in desirable
places at periodic intervals. The environmental and morale leave taken is
ordinary leave. Funded environmental and morale leave is charged as ordinary
leave, but members are authorized to use Department of Defense-owned or
-controlled aircraft; plus, travel time to and from the environmental and
morale leave destination is not charged as leave. Unfunded environmental and
morale leave is also charged as ordinary leave, but members are authorized space-available
air transportation from the duty locations, and travel time to and from the
leave destination is charged as leave.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.19. Regular and Special Passes.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A
pass period is an authorized absence from duty for a relatively short time and
starts from the end of normal work hours on a duty day and ends at the
beginning of normal work hours the next duty day. There are no mileage
restrictions. However, approval authorities may require members to be able to
return to duty within a reasonable time in the event of an operational mission
requirement such as a recall, unit alert, or unit emergency.</span></p>

<p><span>16.19.1.<b>&nbsp;Regular Pass.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A regular pass starts
after normal work hours on a given day and stops at the beginning of normal
work hours the next duty day. This includes nonduty days Saturday, Sunday, and
a holiday for up to 3 days total if a member normally works Monday through
Friday or up to 4 days for a member who works a nontraditional work schedule,
such as a compressed workweek. The combination of nonduty days and a public
holiday may not exceed 4 days. Department of Defense or higher management
levels may determine that a Monday or Friday is compensatory (comp) time off
when a holiday is observed on a Tuesday or Thursday, in which case a regular
pass may consist of a weekend, a comp day off, and a public holiday.</span></p>





<p><span>16.19.2.<b>&nbsp;Special Pass.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Unit
commanders may award 3- or 4-day special passes for special occasions or
circumstances, such as reenlistment or for some type of special recognition or
compensatory time off. They may delegate approval to a level no lower than
squadron section commander, deputies, or equivalents. Special passes start
after normal work hours on a given day. They stop at the beginning of normal
work hours on either the 4th day for a 3-day special pass or the 5</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>&nbsp;day for a 4-day special pass. A 3-day special pass can be
Friday through Sunday, Saturday through Monday, or Tuesday through Thursday. A
4-day special pass can be Thursday through Sunday or Saturday through Tuesday
or Friday through Monday. This applies to a normal Monday through Friday
workweek. Passes may be taken in conjunction with leave without a duty day
between the pass and leave period. The member must be physically present in the
local area when departing and returning from leave. The pass can be taken
before or after leave, but not both.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.20. Permissive Temporary Duty.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Permissive
temporary duty is an administrative absence for which funded temporary duty is
not appropriate. Commanders may not authorize permissive temporary duty in
place of leave or a special pass or in conjunction with special passes.
Normally, Air Force Form 988 is used for all types of permissive temporary
duties. See AFI 36-3003 for complete information.</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.1.<b>&nbsp;Authorized PTDYs.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Types of authorized
permissive temporary duties include, but are not limited to:</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.1.1.
Traveling to or in the vicinity of a new permanent duty station to secure
off-base housing before the member out-processes the old permanent duty
station. (Generally, members request permissive temporary duty after signing in
at the new permanent duty station.)</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.1.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Accompanying
a dependent patient or military member patient to a designated medical
treatment facility not in the local area when the medical authority deems
permissive temporary duty essential.</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.1.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>To
attend a Department of Defense sponsored employment assistance seminar under
the Transition Assistance Program when the member cannot schedule one locally
and when the member will separate or retire within 180 days.</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.1.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>Attending
national conventions or meetings hosted by service-connected organizations such
as the Military Officer Association, Air Force Sergeants Association, or the
Noncommissioned Officers Association.</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.2.<b>&nbsp;Permissive Temporary Duty Not Authorized.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Members are not
authorized permissive temporary duties:</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.2.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>To
search for a house in a close proximity permanent change of station move.</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.2.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>In
conjunction with a permissive reassignment.</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.2.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>To
attend a professional military education graduation when the graduate is a
coworker, friend, or military spouse.</span></p>

<p><span>16.20.2.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>To
attend a change of command or retirement ceremony.&nbsp;<b>Note:&nbsp;</b>The
presiding official for a military retirement ceremony may be authorized
permissive temporary duty.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.21. Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite
Absence:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.21.1.
Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence is in support of the Secretary of
Defense utilization of the total force policy. The program applies to
creditable deployments and mobilizations underway on, or commencing
after,&nbsp;19
January 2007.</span></p>

<p><span>16.21.2.
The Secretary of Defense has directed establishment of programs to recognize
members who are required to mobilize or deploy with a frequency beyond
established rotation goals and Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence as
a new category of administrative absence.</span></p>

<p><span>16.21.3.
The concept of operations is to establish a yearly rotation goal of a
deployment-to-dwell ratio of 1:2. That is, for every 1 year a service member of
the active component is deployed, he or she must have 2 years at his or her
home station. The yearly mobilization-to-dwell ratio goal for the Reserve
Component is 1:5 years. Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence earned
under these conditions is considered administrative absence.</span></p>

<p><span>16.21.4.
For the purpose of accruing Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence under
this program, the Department of the Air Force defines criteria as creditable
deployments/temporary to the land areas of Afghanistan or Iraq on or after</span></p>

<p><span>19 January 2007, but
before 1 October 2011. Aircrew participating in missions into, out of, within
or over the area of</span></p>

<p><span>eligibility in support
of military operations, count each day of operation as 1 day of eligibility.
Deployment is defined as a member temporary duty under contingency, exercise,
and deployment orders to these locations.</span></p>

<p><span>16.21.5. Creditable time
continues to accrue during periods of rest and relaxation, leave, and for
temporary duties outside of Afghanistan or Iraq of 30 consecutive days or less.</span></p>

<p><span>16.21.6.
For qualifying deployments and mobilizations beginning on or after 1 October
2011, Active Component Airmen who, on the first day of their current
deployment, had deployed in excess of 12 months out of the previous 36 months,
and who meet the other eligibility criteria contained in AFI 36-3003, qualify
for Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite Absence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.22. Program Administration:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.22.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Commanders
can only delegate ordinary leave approval to the lowest supervisory level to
meet the needs of the unit. Supervisors should train personnel on the
requirements of the leave program and ensure they know how to use, LeaveWeb and
the Air Force Form 988 to request leave and permissive temporary duty.</span></p>

<p><span>16.22.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Before
approving leave, supervisors should ensure members requesting leave have a
sufficient leave balance. Also, they must ensure members provide a valid
address and emergency telephone number where they can be reached. Before
signing the Air Force Form 988, follow the unit's procedures to obtain a leave
authorization number. Leave numbers normally will not be given earlier than 14
days prior to the leave effective date. Members on leave should use risk
management principles to assess all hazards and control risks before excessive
or hazardous travel, especially when traveling by automobiles. Also,
supervisors should make sure the member has sufficient funds to return to duty
on time. If the documentation is not processed digitally, the unit leave
monitor sends Part I with authorization number to the servicing finance office
and gives Part II to the member after obtaining a leave authorization number.
The supervisor retains Part III for completion after the member returns from
leave.</span></p>

<p><span>16.22.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>When
the member returns from leave, the supervisor determines how the member s
actual leave dates compared to the first and last days of chargeable leave
reported on Air Force Form 988, Part I. The member signs Part III, and the
supervisor certifies the dates of leave and sends Part III to the commander support
staff for processing. If there is a change in the actual number of days the
member took, supervisors will follow the instructions listed in Part III.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;The
Air Force adopted the current method of recording leave to prevent fraud in the
leave reporting system.</span></p>

<p><span>16.22.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>LeaveWeb
is an Air Force system that automates the method of requesting and processing
leave (in lieu of using the hard copy Air Force Form 988). Under LeaveWeb, the
member requests ordinary leave which generates an e-mail to his or her
supervisor. The supervisor approves or disapproves the leave and, if approved,
sends the leave information to the unit leave monitor to validate. Once
validated, the leave is sent electronically to finance. The member prints a
copy of the approved leave form to hand-carry during leave. Upon returning from
leave, the member completes the necessary updates in LeaveWeb and forwards the
e-mail to his or her supervisor for endorsement. This electronic process
reduces waste in materials as well as man-hours.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 16E Equal
Opportunity</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>16.23. Equal Opportunity Policy:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.23.1.
The Air Force is a richly diverse community consisting of Airmen, military and
civilian, with widely varied backgrounds, beliefs, multicultural influences,
and many unique life experiences. Airmen are most effective when they are
working in an environment that promotes teamwork, inclusion, and mutual
respect. Therefore, we must train and prepare our Airmen to view human relation
issues and circumstances more broadly. This will allow them to effectively
understand, engage, and defeat any potential adversary or personal situation
with intelligence and integrity.</span></p>

<p><span>16.23.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
Equal Opportunity Program proactively engages all Airmen in the pursuit of
equal opportunity. The Air Force Equal Opportunity Program has been developed
to foster and support equal opportunity, the Air Force Core Values and</span></p>

<p><span>Airman's Creed, and must
be carried out in the day-to-day actions of all personnel. The Air Force will
not tolerate unlawful discrimination and unlawful harassment or reprisal
against individuals who engage in protected activity. Airmen must actively make
workplace professionalism a top priority and take proactive steps to prevent,
correct and eliminate unlawful discriminatory behavior. Air Force Equal
Opportunity policy compliance is a function of leadership.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.24. Equal Opportunity Program Objectives:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.24.1.
The primary objective of the program is to eradicate unlawful discrimination.
The Equal Opportunity office will assist commanders at all levels in conducting
a continuing campaign to eradicate every form of unlawful discrimination or
harassment from the workplace. In order to promote a workplace free of unlawful
discrimination, to include sexual harassment, the Equal Opportunity office will
take proactive steps to ensure all available efforts are in place (for example,
human relations education, commander's calls, climate assessments).</span></p>

<p><span>16.24.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
program also seeks to foster a positive human relations environment. The Equal
Opportunity office will use the Human Relations Climate Assessment Subcommittee
Installation Equal Opportunity Assessment Summary and Defense Equal Opportunity
Management Institute Organization Climate Survey tool to evaluate positive and
negative factors in the local environment. Human relations education is also
provided through proactive measures to ensure all employees and management
personnel understand the need for a positive human relations environment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.25. Unlawful Discrimination:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.25.1.
Unlawful discrimination against military members includes any unlawful action
that denies Equal Opportunity to persons or groups based on their race, color,
religion, national origin, sexual orientation or sex (including sexual
harassment). This type of discrimination can occur in a variety of forms to
include: in writing, verbal, or in a combination. Unlawful discrimination can
occur on or off base.</span></p>

<p><span>16.25.2.
Unlawful discrimination against Department of Defense civilian employees
includes any unlawful employment practice that occurs when an employer fails or
refuses to hire or promote, discharges, or otherwise discriminates against any
individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of
employment; or limits, segregates, or classifies employees or applicants for
employment in any way that deprives or tends to deprive any individual of
employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his/her status as an
employee because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, (including
sexual harassment, pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation age (40
or older), genetic information, physical or mental disability, or reprisal.</span></p>

<p><span>16.25.3.
Unlawful discrimination can also include the use of disparaging terms regarding
an individual's birthplace, ancestry, culture, or the linguistic
characteristics common to a specific ethnic group. The use of terms that
degrade or connote negative statements pertaining to race, color, religion,
national origin, sex, age, genetic information, and mental or physical disability
can constitute unlawful discrimination. These terms include insults, printed
material, visual material, signs, symbols, posters, or insignia.</span></p>

<p><span>16.25.4.
The operational language of the Air Force is English. Air Force personnel must
maintain sufficient proficiency in English to perform their official/military
duties. All official communications must be understood by everyone who has a
need to know their content. Commanders may require Air Force personnel to use
English only when such use is clearly necessary and proper for the performance
of military duties. Accordingly, commanders, supervisors, and managers at all
levels must not require the use of English for personal communications
unrelated to official duties.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.26. Sexual Harassment:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.26.1. Sexual
harassment is a form of sex discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual
advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a
sexual nature when:</span></p>

<p><span>16.26.1.1. Submission to
such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a
person's job, pay, or career.</span></p>

<p><span>16.26.1.2. Submission to
or rejection of such conduct by a person is used as a basis for career or
employment decisions affecting this person.</span></p>

<p><span>16.26.1.3. Such conduct
has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work
performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment.</span></p>

<p><span>16.26.2.
This definition emphasizes that workplace conduct, to be actionable as an
 abusive work environment,  harassment need not result in concrete
psychological harm to the victim, but rather need only be so severe or
pervasive that a reasonable person would perceive, and the victim does
perceive, the work environment as hostile or offensive. Workplace is an
expansive term for military members and may include conduct on or off duty, 24
hours a day.</span></p>

<p><span>16.26.3.
Any person in a supervisory or command position who uses or condones any form
of sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the career, pay, or job of
a military member or civilian employee is engaging in sexual harassment.
Similarly, any military member or civilian employee who makes deliberate or
repeated unwelcome verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual
nature in the workplace is also engaging in sexual harassment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.27. Military Equal Opportunity Complaint
Process:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.27.1.&nbsp;<b>Authorization.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Only military personnel, their family members, and retirees may
file military Equal Opportunity complaints. To file a complaint, the individual
must be the subject of the alleged unlawful discrimination or sexual
harassment. Third parties, to include commanders, supervisors or co-workers,
may not file a complaint on behalf of another individual. The Equal Opportunity
office will refer all third party individuals who are aware of specific
allegations of military</span></p>

<p><span>Equal Opportunity policy
violations to their respective chain of command. The Equal Opportunity office
will not</span></p>

<p><span>accept military
complaints from military members, family members or retirees if their concern
is related to their off-base or Department of Defense civilian employment.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.2.&nbsp;<b>Military Informal Complaint
Procedures</b>.</span></p>

<p><span>The purpose of the
military informal complaint process is to attempt resolution at the lowest
possible level.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.2.1.
To informally resolve unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment complaints,
individuals may orally address or prepare written correspondence to the alleged
offender, request intervention by a coworker, opt to use the alternate dispute
resolution process, or use the chain of command (for example, request
assistance from the supervisor, first sergeant, or commander).</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.2.2. There is no
time limit for filing informal complaints and no requirement for commander
approval before accepting informal complaints.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.2.3.
Informal sexual harassment complaints must be processed in accordance with
Title 10, United States Code, Section 1561,&nbsp;<i>Complaints of Sexual
Harassment: Investigation by Commanding Officers</i>&nbsp;and complaint
allegations must be forwarded to the applicable General Court-Martial Convening
Authority. The commander must initiate a Commander Directed Investigation. The
Equal Opportunity office will serve as Subject Matter Experts for commanders
and organizations conducting sexual harassment investigations. The Commander
Directed Investigation process for sexual harassment complaints must be
complete within 14 calendar days.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.3.&nbsp;<b>Military Formal Complaint
Procedures:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.27.3.1.
The purpose of the military formal complaint process is to enable military
members, retirees and their family members to formally present allegations of
unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment to the Equal Opportunity office
with the goal of attempting resolution through a complaint clarification
process.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.3.1.1.
Complaint clarification is the process of gathering information regarding a
formal military complaint or hotline complaint to determine whether a
"preponderance of evidence" exists to demonstrate that unlawful
discrimination or sexual harassment occurred. The complaint clarification
includes interviewing or taking statements from complainants, potential
witnesses, alleged offenders and anyone else who may have information relevant to
the case. The Equal Opportunity office may use information gathered from other
investigations in conjunction with (but not in lieu of) their own clarification
process to establish a preponderance of credible evidence.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.3.1.2. The
clarification results are forwarded to the Staff Judge Advocate for a legal
sufficiency review. Once the review is complete, the alleged offender s
commander receives the complaint for final action, if appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.3.1.3.
The entire complaint clarification process for unlawful discrimination
complaints must be completed within 20 duty days. This includes 9 duty days for
the Equal Opportunity office to conduct a clarification, 6 duty days for legal
review, and 5 duty days for commander action, if required.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.3.1.4.
Formal sexual harassment complaints must be processed in accordance with Title
10, United States Code, Section 1561,&nbsp;<i>Complaints of Sexual Harassment:
Investigation by Commanding Officers</i>. The complaint clarification process
for sexual harassment complaints must be complete within 14 duty days. This
includes 6 duty days for the Equal Opportunity office to conduct a
clarification, 4 duty days for legal review, and 4 duty days for commander
action, if required.</span></p>

<p><span>16.27.3.2.
Military formal complaints must be filed within 60 calendar days of the alleged
offense. The installation commander may waive the time limits for good cause
based on a memorandum with sufficient justification provided by the complainant
and submitted through the Equal Opportunity office.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.28. Civilian Complaint Process.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Only
Air Force employees, former employees, and applicants for employment may file
civilian Equal Opportunity complaints. An aggrieved person can file a complaint
if discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, (including
pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation) national origin, age (40
and older), or disability, or if subjected to sexual harassment or retaliated
against for opposing discrimination or for participating in the complaint
process. Additionally, an employee can file a complaint under Title II of the
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which prohibits genetic
information discrimination for any aspect of employment, including hiring,
firing, pay, job assignments, promotion, layoff, training, fringe benefits, or
any other term or condition of employment. To harass or retaliate against a
person because of his or her genetic information is illegal under the Genetic
Information Nondiscrimination Act.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.28.1.&nbsp;<b>Civilian Informal Complaint Procedures:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.28.1.1. The
purpose of the civilian informal complaint process is to provide for the
prompt, fair and impartial processing and resolution of complaints, consistent
with legal obligations under Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part
1614,&nbsp;<i>Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity</i>. The objective is
to seek opportunities to resolve issues at the lowest organizational level at
the earliest possible time.</span></p>

<p><span>16.28.1.2. The
Equal Opportunity office will work with management and the staff judge advocate
in an attempt to resolve the complainant's concerns. The Equal Opportunity
office must complete the informal complaint process within 30 calendar days of
the complaint being filed unless the complainant grants an extension not to exceed
60 additional calendar days.</span></p>

<p><span>16.28.1.3. If the
matter is not resolved to the complainant's satisfaction before the end of the
authorized period, including extensions, the complainant is issued a notice of
right to file a formal complaint.</span></p>

<p><span>16.28.2.&nbsp;<b>Civilian Formal Complaint Procedures:&nbsp;</b><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.28.2.1. A formal
complaint must be filed at the installation where the alleged discrimination
occurred. In order for the complaint to be processed at the formal stage, the
initial contact must be within 45 calendar days of the date of the matter
alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45
calendar days of the effective date or when he or she becomes aware of the
personnel action. The complaint must describe the actions or practices that
form the basis of the complaint that was discussed with the Equal Opportunity
office during the informal complaint process.</span></p>

<p><span>16.28.2.2. The
complaint must be filed with the Equal Opportunity director or designee within
15 calendar days of the complainant receiving the notice of right to file a
formal complaint.</span></p>

<p><span>16.28.2.3. The Air
Force is required to process civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaints in
accordance with Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1614 and Equal
Employment Opportunity Management Directive 110. The Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission requires federal agencies to discharge certain
responsibilities once a civilian formal Equal Opportunity complaint has been
filed.</span></p>

<p><span>16.28.2.4. The
Equal Opportunity office must process all formal complaints expeditiously and
make a determination whether to accept, dismiss, or partially dismiss a
complaint or portion of a complaint to allow an investigation to be completed
within 180 calendar days from the date of filing.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.29. Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.29.1. An Equal
Opportunity and Treatment Incident is an overt, adverse act, occurring on or
off base, directed toward an individual, group, or institution which is
motivated by or has overtones based on race, color, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation or sex which has the potential to have a negative impact on
the installation human relations climate. An Equal Opportunity and Treatment
Incident may include subjects other than military members such as retirees and family
members.</span></p>

<p><span>16.29.2. The Air
Force classifies these incidents as minor, serious, or major based on: the
number of participants, property damage, physical injury, assault, arson,
and/or an act resulting in death. Vandalism (degrading graffiti), hate group
activity, discriminatory epithets, signs, symbols, or the use of slurs based on
race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or sex may be
classified as an Equal Opportunity and Treatment Incident.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 16F Legal
Services</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>16.30<i>.&nbsp;</i>Legal Office.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Legal offices
provide legal assistance in connection with personal civil legal matters to
support and sustain command effectiveness and readiness. Under Title 10, United
States Code, Section 1044, the ability to offer legal assistance and legal
services to the eligible categories of personnel is contingent upon the
availability of legal staff resources and regulations as may be prescribed by
the Secretary of the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.31<i>.&nbsp;</i>Personal Legal Readiness.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Legal readiness is
the state of legal preparation in which Air Force members are ready to deploy,
both in their personal and mission capacities. Legal readiness involves the
member's awareness of the personal legal issues that may arise in preparation
for or during a deployment and the remedies available to avoid or lessen any
adverse effects of those issues. This is usually provided through legal
assistance available to Regular Air Force members, reservists, and guardsmen on
federal Regular Air Force, their dependents, and civilian employees stationed overseas
and their families. Personnel tasked for deployment at their bases are briefed
on preparing their personal and family legal affairs for deployment. Subject
areas include, but are not necessarily limited to, wills; service members Group
Life Insurance designations; general and special powers of attorney; medical
planning, including advance medical directives (living wills and medical or
health care powers of attorney), and designation of anatomical gifts; guardians
or in loco parentis powers of attorney to ensure care of minor children;
landlord-tenant matters; income exclusions and/or tax return filing extensions
applicable to potential deployment locations; property and financial affairs
management; protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act; protections
under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act for reserve
personnel deploying; and ensuring important documents are maintained in safe,
secure, and reasonably accessible locations.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.32.
Complaints of Wrongs under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military Justice.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The Uniform Code of Military Justice,
Article 138, is another provision for protecting individuals' rights. Members
of the Armed Forces who believe they have been wronged by their commanding
officers may request redress under the provisions of Article 138. AFI
51-904,&nbsp;<i>Complaints of Wrongs under Article 38, Uniform Code of Military
Justice</i>&nbsp;implements Article 138. Any member of the armed forces who
believes himself wronged by his commanding officer, and who, upon due
application to that commanding officer, is refused redress, may complain to any
superior commissioned officer, who shall forward the complaint to the officer
exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the officer against whom the
complaint is made. The officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction
shall examine into the complaint and take proper measures for redressing the
wrong complained of; and he shall as soon as possible, send to the Secretary
concerned a true statement of that complaint, with the proceedings had thereon.</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>A
member may use Article 138 when a discretionary act or omission by his or her
commander adversely affects the member personally. Examples include acts that
violate law or regulation; those that exceed the legitimate authority of the
commander; ones that are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; or
those that clearly apply administrative standards unfairly. However, the
Article 138 complaint system will not provide redress for:</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.1.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Submissions
related to acts or omissions that were not initiated, carried out, or approved
by the member's commander;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.1.2.
Submissions seeking reversal or modification of non-discretionary command
actions. For example, mandatory filings of adverse information in an
unfavorable information file are not reviewed under Article 138, Uniform Code
of Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.1.3.&nbsp;<b>S</b>ubmissions
challenging the actions of the commander complained against which addressed an
Article 138 application for redress, or actions by the General Court-Martial
Convening Authority on an Article 138 complaint;</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.1.3.1.
However, a submission alleging that the commander or General Court-Martial
Convening Authority failed to act on or forward a formal complaint, will be
considered under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military, as a new application
for redress against the commander or General Court-Martial Convening Authority,
as appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.1.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>Submissions filed on
behalf of another person; and.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.1.5. Submissions requesting
disciplinary action against another person.</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>A
member who believes himself or herself wronged by the action of his or her
commander, before submitting a complaint under Article 138, must apply in
writing through channels to that commander for redress of the grievance. A
complaint (in writing) to that commander, or his or her designated
representative, is sufficient. Absent unusual circumstances, the member must
apply for redress within 90 days of the member's discovery of the wrong
complained of and the complaint should contain all available supporting
evidence.</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.2.1. If the
commander who allegedly wronged the member is no longer in command of the
member, the member must still submit the initial application for redress to the
commander who allegedly wronged the member, regardless of that commander s
current position or duty location, or the member's current position or duty
location.</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
commander complained of may consider other reliable evidence, in addition to
matters submitted by the member. Such additional evidence will be attached to
the file so the member and the commander's general court-martial authority can
review the complaint.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.4. Not later
than 30 days<b>&nbsp;</b>after receipt of the initial application for redress,
the commander must notify the member in writing that:</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.4.1.
A decision regarding the requested relief has been deferred to allow for the
completion of further fact gathering. Such notice of a deferral shall be sent
every 30 days<b>&nbsp;</b>until such fact gathering proceeding is completed.
Such notice prohibits the member from requesting General Court-Martial
Convening Authority review, as provided</span></p>

<p><span>in AFI 51-904,
paragraph 6.3, until 90 days<b>&nbsp;</b>have elapsed from the initial
application for redress; or</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.4.2. The redress requested is
granted, or<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.4.3. The requested relief is wholly
or partially denied because:</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.4.3.1. The requested relief is not
warranted;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.4.3.2. The submission is outside the
scope of Article 138, Uniform Code of Military Justice;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.4.3.3. The submission is untimely; or<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>16.32.4.3.4. There is a more appropriate
channel for reviewing the complaint.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.5. If the
commander denies the requested relief because there is a more appropriate
channel for reviewing the complaint or the commander lacks authority to grant
the requested relief, the commander must:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.5.1. Forward
the submission (including any supporting evidence) to the appropriate
processing office or officer, if any, with authority to grant the requested
relief.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.5.2. Return
the submission (including any supporting evidence) to the member and direct the
member to the appropriate office or officer, if any, with authority to grant
the requested relief.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.5.3. If
appropriate, inform the member of his or her right to file an application with
the Air Force Board for</span></p>

<p><span>Correction
of Military Records, in accordance with AFI 36-2603,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Board
for Correction of Military Records</i>, and AFPAM 36-2607,&nbsp;<i>Applicants 
Guide to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR)</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.6. In all
cases, keep a copy of the request, the supporting evidence, and the action
taken.</span></p>

<p><span>16.32.7. If the
member's commander wholly or partially denies an initial application for
redress under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military Justice, the member must
request General Court-Martial Convening Authority review within 30 daysafter

<p><span>16.32.11. Untimely
formal complaints under Article 138, Uniform Code of Military Justice, will be
denied without a determination on the merits of the submission and returned to
the member, unless the General Court-Martial Convening Authority waives the
time requirement for good cause.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.12. Not later
than 60 days<b>&nbsp;</b>after receipt of the formal complaint, the General
Court-Martial Convening Authority must notify the member that:<b>&nbsp;</b><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.32.12.1. A

Safety&nbsp;</span></i></b><b><span>16.33.
Mishap Prevention Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.33.1.<b>&nbsp;Purpose.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
purpose of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program is to minimize the loss of
Air Force resources and protect Air Force people from death, injuries, or
occupational illnesses by managing risks on- and off- duty. This program
applies to all operations except where otherwise prescribed or specified in
Status-of-Forces Agreements. Continuing to meet this goal is critical to our
mission effectiveness. The challenge of deployments, technologically advanced
combat systems, and changing duty requirements demands strong on-duty mishap
prevention programs. Off-duty mishap prevention must also adapt to meet the
challenges posed by motor vehicles, sports and recreation, and other off-duty
activities. All Air Force personnel have responsibilities in the mishap
prevention program as aligned within the Air Force Safety Management System and
will utilize sound risk management principles, processes, tools, and techniques
to assess and mitigate risk associated with both on- and off-duty activities.
The Air Force Safety</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="381" height="295" src="afh1_files/image243.png" ></span><span>Management System is a mishap prevention
framework mandated by AFI 91-202,&nbsp;<i>The US Air Force Mishap Prevention
Program.</i>&nbsp;The Air Force Safety Management System conceptualizes the
mishap prevention effort in four pillars.<span>&nbsp;</span>These
pillars are: Policy and Leadership,</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Risk&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>Management,&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>Assurance,&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>and</span></p>

<p><span>Promotion and
Education.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.1.1.
The purpose of the Air Force Safety Management System is to utilize the four
pillars, as depicted in Figure 16.1, as a framework for structuring the Air
Force mishap prevention programs and activities used to minimize risk and
reduce the occurrence and cost of injuries, illnesses, fatalities and property
damage. Leadership implements the Air Force Safety Management System by
providing guidance and goals, establishing safety responsibility and
accountability, applying risk management to all activities, and promoting the
Air Force Safety</span></p>

<p><span>Management System
throughout the organization. This implementation of the Air Force Safety
Management System prevents mishaps and preserves combat capability. Managing
mishap prevention activities requires goal setting, planning, executing, and
measuring performance in a Plan Do Check Act continuous improvement process.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.1.2. Plan Do
Check Act is an iterative four-step management method used for the control and
continuous improvement of processes and products. Leaders from the squadron to
the headquarters will use the Plan Do Check Act methodology to ensure that
continuous improvement is being accomplished.</span></p>

<p><span>16.34.1.3. The
desired end result of the Air Force Safety Management System framework is
mishap prevention.<span>&nbsp;</span>Mishaps cost money,
cost lives, and degrade mission and morale. All mishaps are preventable whether
they occur off duty or on duty. Commanders, supervisors, and individuals must
ensure a robust safety culture permeates through all activities.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.33.2.<b>&nbsp;Mishap Defined.</b></span></p>

<p><span>An Air Force mishap
is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in
occupational illnesses or death or injury to Air Force personnel, or damage to
Department of Defense property.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Class
A Mishap.&nbsp;</b>Direct mishap cost totaling $2,000,000, destruction of a
Department of Defense aircraft, or a fatality or permanent total disability.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Class
B Mishap.</b>&nbsp;Direct mishap costs totaling $500,000 or more but less than
$2,000,000, a permanent partial disability, or inpatient hospitalization of
three or more personnel</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Class
C Mishap.</b>&nbsp;Direct mishap cost totaling $50,000 or more but less than
$500,000, or a nonfatal injury or illness that results in one or more days away
from work.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Class
D Mishap.</b>&nbsp;Direct mishap cost totaling $20,000 or more but less than
$50,000, or a recordable injury or illness not otherwise classified as a Class
A, B, or C mishap.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.3.<b>&nbsp;Mishap Prevention Responsibilities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Commanders,
functional managers, supervisors, and individuals will enforce established
safety rules and carry out required Air Force Safety Management System
responsibilities identified within AFI 91-202. They will enforce rules,
criteria, procedures, and safety standards to help eliminate unsafe acts or
conditions. An effective mishap prevention program depends on individuals
integrating mishap prevention principles at every functional level, and taking
personal and collective responsibility for complying with and enforcing
applicable safety standards.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.33.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Safety
Office.&nbsp;</b>At the installation level, safety staffs, host and tenant
unit, implement mishap prevention programs for all Air Force units as
prescribed by AFI 91-202 and applicable host tenant support agreements. The
occupational safety staff consists of career safety professionals who are
first-term and career Airmen trained in the enlisted safety career field (Air
Force Specialty Code 1S0X1), as well as Department of Air Force civilians. With
the assistance of the commanders, supervisors, and individuals, the host safety
office staff provides oversight of the safety program and provides support and
guidance to help eliminate unsafe acts or conditions. When mishaps occur, the
safety staff ensures all mishaps are investigated and reported.&nbsp;<b>Note</b>:
Air Force safety investigations are for mishap prevention purposes only--not
for punitive actions or pecuniary liability.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Commanders.&nbsp;</b>Commanders
at all levels are responsible for implementing the United States Air Force
mishap prevention program in accordance with the framework of the Air Force
Safety Management System.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.3.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Installation
Commanders.&nbsp;</b>Installation<b>&nbsp;</b>commanders provide safe and
healthful workplaces for all installation employees; ensure leadership at all
levels is held accountable for enforcing safety and occupational health
standards, and chair the installation safety council and/or environment,
safety, and occupational health council.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.3.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Commanders
below installation level.&nbsp;</b>Commanders below installation level
implement a safety and health program in their unit, or area of responsibility.
Where commanders are not authorized fulltime safety personnel, they will
appoint a primary and alternate unit safety representative to assist them in
implementing their safety program. They also ensure a proactive mishap
prevention program is implemented to include procurement and proper use of
personal protective equipment, and worker/facility compliance with applicable
standards.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.3.3.<b>&nbsp;Supervisors.&nbsp;</b>Supervisors
understand and enforce the safety and health standards that apply to their
areas, operations, and operations involving their subordinates. They use risk
management techniques to analyze work environments and job tasks for hazards;
the job safety analysis will be used as part of this process. They review work
processes annually, when new tasks or equipment are added, or when existing
tasks change. They develop a work-center-specific Job Safety Training Outline
on safety, fire prevention/protection, and health requirements. Supervisors
will document and maintain completed training in the work area, and will
conduct and document monthly spot inspections of the work areas. They report
all mishaps that occur in work areas, off-duty mishaps involving assigned
personnel, and related subsequent employee absences to the supporting safety
office, and ensure the proper forms are completed if a mishap involves a
civilian employee.</span></p>

<p><span>16.33.3.4.<b>&nbsp;Individuals.&nbsp;</b>Individuals
hold a vital role in preventing mishaps. A failure to intervene when a
potential unsafe act is identified is a failure to protect. Every Air Force
member is accountable for considering their personal safety and the safety of
others when participating in on and off-duty activities. Individuals are
responsible for complying with all safety instructions, technical orders, job
guides, and operating procedures. They identify and report hazardous conditions
that place Air Force personnel or property at risk to supervision and/or using
the Air Force Form 457,&nbsp;<i>USAF Hazard Report,</i>&nbsp;when necessary.
Individuals will report personal injury, property damage, and any suspected
exposure to biological, chemical, or nuclear hazardous materials to their
supervisors as soon as practical, but not to exceed 24 hours. Individuals
should immediately report to their supervisor a physical or mental condition
that they feel could impact safe job performance. Individuals will use personal
protection equipment for job tasks as identified by supervision. Apply risk
management principles in both on- and off-duty activities to enhance the safety
and wellbeing of themselves and other personnel.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.34. Human Factors:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.34.1.&nbsp;<b>Overview.</b>&nbsp;Human
factors is about people in their living and working environments, and how
features of individual's tools, tasks, and working environment influence human
performance. The Air Force leverages standardized Department of Defense Human
Factors Analysis and Classification System codes to determine errors
contributory or causal in Air Force mishaps. Through a systematic root cause(s)
analysis, human factors deficiencies can be identified, mitigation strategies
can be applied, organizational cultures can be improved, and processes can be
established to interrupt chains of events and avoid mishaps. To improve human
performance and use Human Factors Analysis and Classification System
effectively, we must understand the different hazards that exist and how to
properly mitigate risks along potential mishap pathways.</span></p>

<p><span>16.34.2.&nbsp;<b>Root Cause(s) Analysis.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force uses
four levels to determine the root cause(s) of a mishap when dealing with Human
Factors Analysis and Classification System: Organizational Influences,
Supervision, Preconditions, and Acts:</span></p>

<p><span>16.34.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Organizational
Influences<i>&nbsp;</i></b>are factors in a mishap if the communications,
actions, omissions, or policies of upper-level management directly or
indirectly affect supervisory practices, conditions or actions of the
operator(s) and result in a system failure, human error, or an unsafe
situation.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.34.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Supervision.</b>&nbsp;Unsafe
supervision can stem from failure to correct known problems, inappropriately
planned operations, inadequate supervision, and supervisory violations.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.34.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Preconditions</b>&nbsp;are
factors in a mishap if conditions of the operators/individuals, environmental
factors, or personnel factors affect practices, conditions, or actions of
individuals and result in human error or an unsafe situation.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.34.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Acts<i>&nbsp;</i></b>are
the active failures or actions committed by the operator which complete the
mishap event sequence and fall into two categories: violations and errors.
Violations factor into mishaps when personnel disregard rules and instructions
leading to unsafe acts.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.34.2.5. Through
the four levels of Human Factors Analysis and Classification System, we can not
only determine mishap root cause(s) for mishaps that have taken place, but more
importantly, we can leverage Human Factors Analysis and Classification System
to identify hazards early, mitigate risks on our on- and off-duty activities,
and proactively avoid mishaps altogether.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.34.2.6. Figure 16.2
is a diagram describing the complex factors by which the holes in the  cheese 
can align resulting in a mishap. Many mishaps have strong correlations to
previous mishaps. If we know what the failures or  holes' are, we can develop
controls to minimize the risk of similar mishaps happening in the future.</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="383" height="317" src="afh1_files/image244.png" ></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><b><sup><span>16.35.</span></sup></b></span><span><sup><span>&nbsp;<b>Accountability.&nbsp;</b></span></sup></span><span><b><sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup></b></span><b><span>Figure 16.2. Complex Factors that can Lead
to a Mishap.</span></b></p>

<p><span>We
cannot tolerate reckless behavior or unwise (Adapted from Reason, J (1990).
Human Error. Cambridge decisions. All Airmen must take personal University
Press)</span></p>

<p><span>responsibility and
be held accountable for their actions. Supervisors will ensure military and
civilian personnel understand the implications of poor decisions and the
importance of compliance. Commanders will ensure personnel are aware of Air
Force instruction requirements and enforce compliance. Violations by military
personnel are punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and may
also be considered misconduct during line-of-duty determinations.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Safety
investigations are for mishap prevention purposes only. Commanders may direct
an additional investigation and use factual information (time, speed, position,
weather, etc.) and information obtained elsewhere (non-privileged witness
statements, police reports, etc.) for disciplinary purposes (Letter of
Reprimand, Article 15, etc.).</span></p>

<p><span>16.35.1.&nbsp;<b>Potential Impact of</b>&nbsp;<b>Not in</b>&nbsp;<b>Line
of Duty Determination.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A member who is
injured due to his or her own misconduct stands to lose substantial benefits.
If a member dies due to his or her own misconduct, the family stands to lose
benefits. Regular pay, disability retirement pay, disability severance pay,
veterans' benefits, and survivor benefit plan payments may be reduced or lost.
The Servicemember who is permanently disabled due to injury or illness while
not in the line-of-duty faces discharge without benefits or further medical
care.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.35.2.&nbsp;<b>How to Protect Yourself and Your Family.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Think before you
act. Driving while under the influence is obvious misconduct. You do not have
to be intoxicated to be found not in the line-of-duty. Speeding, recklessness,
and failure to use personal protective equipment resulting in injury may lead
to disciplinary action. Your career, your family's well-being, and most
importantly your life depend on you making wise decisions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.36. Occupational Safety Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.36.1.
Supervisors are responsible for training, establishing work methods and job
instructions, assigning jobs, and supervising personnel. They are in the best
position to identify hazards, assess risks associated with those hazards, and
correct unsafe work practices or safety deficiencies that would impede mission
success.</span></p>

<p><span>16.36.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>One
of the greatest influences on successful mission accomplishment is a highly
trained workforce that recognizes the importance of safety precautions and
procedures and adheres to standards incorporating the basic elements of risk
management.</span></p>

<p><span>16.36.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Safety
training may be integrated into task performance training or conducted
separately. Before any operation begins and any safety training can take place,
the supervisor must determine where people may be injured or equipment damaged.
A job safety analysis is used to evaluate each work task not governed by a
technical order or other definitive guidance and when a new work task or
process is introduced into the workplace. If unsafe and unhealthful working
conditions exist, eliminate or control them through engineering, administrative
controls, or personal protective equipment. Commanders and supervisors must
provide personal protective equipment for Air Force military members and
civilian employees. The use of personal protective equipment is appropriate
only if other controls are not possible or practical.</span></p>

<p><span>16.36.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>Supervisors
must document safety training.<b>&nbsp;</b>The method of documentation may
include, but is not limited to, the</span></p>

<p><span>Air Force Form
55,&nbsp;<i>Employee Safety and Health Record</i>, electronic mediums such as
Air Force forms/MAF LOG C2/CASB/G081 or locally developed products. If the Air
Force Form 55 is mandated for use as the training documentation device, the
entity that mandated the form usage will prescribe the requirement in writing
to include entries that require signatures, e.g., hazard communication,
respirator, low powered industrial, lockout/tagout, fall protection, confined
spaces, radiation safety, laser safety, etc.&nbsp;<b>Note</b>: Signature of the
supervisor or the person who conducted the training; other documents may
require the initials of the individual and trainer/supervisor.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.37. Hazard Identification and Reporting:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.37.1. Mishap
prevention begins with hazard identification. As a supervisor, a good way to
know where to begin identifying hazards is to study historical workplace injury
and fatality trends. The installation safety office can offer personalized
workplace mishap trending. Injury and illness trends are also released annually
by The Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration in conjunction with the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2014, the six most common ways workers died on
the job are:</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.1.1.
Transportation mishaps (traffic mishaps), 1,976 fatalities.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.37.1.2. Falls
(one level to another; slips and trips), 819 fatalities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.1.3.
Workplace violence (homicides), 771 fatalities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.1.4. Contact
with objects (struck by, struck against), 723 fatalities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.1.5. Exposure
to harmful substances (chemicals), 385 fatalities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.1.6. Fire
(fires, smoke, explosions), 147 fatalities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2. On and off
duty Airmen are not immune to injury, illness, and death. Off duty, the most
common way Airmen are injured or die is from vehicle related mishaps. On duty,
Airmen experience injuries and death similar to national workplace statistics:
falls, vehicle mishaps, and struck by objects. Injuries, illnesses, and
fatalities can be eliminated through hazard identification. Hazard
identification not only includes understanding how injuries occur, but also
understanding and enforcing safety standards. Although not all inclusive, to
ensure the safety of all, commanders, supervisors, and Airmen at all levels
will:</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2.1. Keep
areas around exit doors and passageways free of obstructions. Ensure the exit
route leads to a public way.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2.2. Remove
from service ladders with broken or missing steps, rungs or cleats, broken side
rails, or other defects.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2.3.
Frequently check the third and/or grounding prong is secure, especially on
items unplugged frequently. Do not cut off the prong, or use an adapter to
allow a three-prong plug to fit a two-prong receptacle, since this negates
third-wire grounding protection.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2.4. Only use multi-receptacle surge protectors to power
computers and related equipment such as lights and or fans. Do not use surge
protectors or extension cords with high current items such as coffee makers,
refrigerators, microwave ovens, heaters, food preparation equipment, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2.5. Ensure
Personal Protective Equipment is worn appropriately and where needed (fall
protection gear, eye protection, etc.)</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2.6. Ensure
Technical Orders, Air Force Instructions, and other regulations are followed.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.2.7. Seek to
identify and correct hazards such as missing guards, areas where falls are
likely, missing and damaged safety equipment, confined space areas, and falling
or loose objects/debris.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Report
hazards to the responsible supervisor or local agency. If the hazard is
eliminated on the spot, no further action is required; sharing information with
other units or agencies may prevent duplicating hazards and deficiencies
elsewhere and is recommended. If the hazard presents imminent danger, the
supervisor or individual responsible for that area must take immediate action
to correct the situation or apply interim control measures. Report hazards to
the safety office that cannot be eliminated immediately using Air Force Form
457,&nbsp;<i>USAF Hazard Report</i>, by telephone, or in person. Reports can be
submitted anonymously. The Chief of Safety will determine the appropriate
safety, fire, or health discipline to investigate the hazard report. The
investigator discusses the hazard report with the member who submitted the
report (if known), the responsible supervisor or manager, and other parties
involved to validate the hazard and determine the best interim controls and
corrective action.</span></p>

<p><span>16.37.4. Air Force
Form 457,&nbsp;<i>USAF Hazard Report,</i>&nbsp;must be readily available to all
unit personnel in the work center. The investigator must respond within 10 duty
days in writing about the corrective action or plans, and conduct follow-up
reviews until the corrective action is completed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.38. Traffic Safety:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.38.1.
The Air Force Traffic Safety program is aimed at preventing and reducing
traffic mishaps using a wide-range of mishap prevention program specifically
focusing on driving behaviors and risk management. Off-duty traffic mishaps are
the leading cause of Air Force fatalities, with motorcycle mishaps accounting
for approximately half of all AF traffic fatalities. This is an alarming fact,
considering Air Force motorcycle riders, account for only 9 percent of the Air
Force population.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.38.2. Reckless
driving behaviors (i.e. driving under the influence, speeding, distracted
driving, lack of training) are the leading cause in over 75 percent of all
private motor vehicle mishaps. Distracted driving (primarily cell phone
usage/text messaging) has increased in recent years and according to the
National Safety Council was involved in 26 percent of all 2014 motor vehicle
mishaps. Several tools are available to help supervisors in educating Airmen in
safe driving practice, including Motorcycle training classes, Motorcycle Unit
Safety Tracking Tool, Travel Risk Planning System and several online/classroom
traffic safety courses.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 16H Risk
Management</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>16.39. Definition.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Risk management is
a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible courses of
action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action
for any given situation. Risk management enables commanders, functional managers,
supervisors, and individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks
through application of a simple, systematic process appropriate for all
personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty situations. Appropriate use of
risk management increases an organization's and individual's ability to safely
and effectively accomplish their mission/activity while preserving lives and
precious resources.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.1.<b>&nbsp;Risk Management Principles.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Four principles
govern all actions associated with risk management. These principles are the
cornerstone of effective risk management and are applicable 24-hours a day,
7-days a week, 365-days a year (24-7-365) by all personnel, for all on- and
off-duty operations, tasks and activities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Accept
No Unnecessary Risk.&nbsp;</b>Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate
return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities and will not
contribute meaningfully to mission or activity accomplishment, and needlessly
jeopardizes personnel or other assets. All Air Force missions and daily
routines involve risk. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are
those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources
to the lowest acceptable risk; take only those risks that are necessary to accomplish
the mission or task. However, we cannot and should not be completely risk
averse; even high risk endeavors may be undertaken when there is a well-founded
basis to believe that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the costs.
Balancing benefits and costs is a subjective process and tied intimately with
the factors affecting the mission or activity; therefore, personnel with prior
knowledge and experience of the mission or activity must be engaged whenever
possible in making risk decisions to ensure a proper balance is achieved.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Make
Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level.&nbsp;</b>Although anyone can make a
risk decision that impacts their personal well-being, some risk acceptance
decisions must be made by an appropriate decision-making authority that can
effectively allocate resources and implement controls to mitigate or eliminate
risks associated with an operation/activity. Making risk decisions at the
appropriate level also establishes clear accountability. Leaders and
individuals must be aware of how much risk they can accept and when to elevate
risk management decisions to a higher level. Those accountable for the success
or failure of the mission or activity must be fully engaged in the risk
decision process.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Integrate
Risk Management into Operations and Planning at All Levels.&nbsp;</b>Integrate
risk management into planning at all levels and as early as possible. This
provides the greatest opportunity to make well informed risk decisions and
implement effective risk controls. To effectively apply risk management,
commanders, supervisors, and personnel must dedicate time and resources to
integrate risk management principles into planning, operational processes and
day-to-day activities. Risk assessments of operations and activities are most
successful when they are accomplished in the normal sequence of events (the
pre-planning of a mission or activity) by individuals directly involved in the
event, and not as a last minute or add-on process. Any amount of pre-planning
that can be accomplished, even in a time constrained environment is better than
no planning at all.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.1.4.<b>&nbsp;Apply
the process cyclically and continuously.&nbsp;</b>Risk management is a
continuous process applied across the full spectrum of military training and
operations, base operations functions, and day-to-day activities and events
both on and off duty. This cyclic process is used to continuously identify and
assess hazards, develop and implement controls, evaluate outcomes, and provide
feedback to our Airmen to save lives and preserve combat resources.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.2.&nbsp;<b>Risk Management Levels.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The principles,
goals and fundamental concepts of risk management highlight the universal
application of risk management concepts both on- and off-duty. There are two
primary levels of risk management (<i>Deliberate&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Real-Time</i>)
that dictate the level of effort and scope that should normally be undertaken
when evaluating risk(s). Figure 16.3 depicts the basic relationship of these
levels and how they relate across the strategic (long-term) to tactical
(short-term) spectrums. The controls/resources and issues shown below the risk
management levels are examples of resources and impacts that might apply across
the planning and execution timelines. As the diagram shows, Deliberate and
Real-Time risk management are interrelated when making risk management
decisions; they are separated only at the point where the planning phase
transitions to the execution phase of the mission/activity. A strong, effective
risk management process involves careful and deliberative planning coupled with
effective, realtime risk management. This full spectrum approach ensures
comprehensive risk mitigation and the likelihood of mission/activity success.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Deliberate
Risk Management.&nbsp;</b>Deliberate risk management refers to
pre-mission/activity planning and involves the full formal application of the
complete 5-Step risk management process outlined in paragraph 16.39.3. This
process can range from an in-depth planning process involving thorough hazard
identification, detailed data research, diagram and analysis tools, formal
testing, and long-term tracking of the risks associated with an operation,
activity or system, down to normal day-to-day operations/activity planning that
utilize the same 5-Step risk management process, but require less time and
resources to complete. Generally associated with strategic-level planning,
in-depth risk management planning is reserved for complex operations/systems,
high priority/high visibility situations or circumstances in which hazards are
not well understood. In-depth risk management is normally implemented well in
advance of the planned system, mission, event, or activity and is normally
reserved for more complex and risky efforts (such as large troop/unit
movements, airshow planning, system development, tactics and training curricula
development, scheduled vacations, organized camping/hiking activities,
scheduled home repairs, etc.). As the situation, operation, or activity becomes
less complex, familiar and/or closer to execution, deliberate risk management
planning becomes simplified and the focus shifts to ensuring near-term hazards
and mitigation strategies are considered. Across the spectrum of deliberate
risk management, we must always include the experience, expertise, and knowledge
of experienced personnel to identify known hazards/risks and strategies to
effectively mitigate risks for the specific mission, activity, or task in both
on- and off-duty situations. Although pre-planning is always desired for any
situation, we must also consider how we deal with risk management once we begin
the execution phase of an activity.</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="566" height="271" src="afh1_files/image245.png" ></span><b><span>Figure 16.3. Relationship of Risk
Management Levels</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.39.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Real-Time.&nbsp;</b>This
level of risk management is always associated with risk management decisions
made in  Real-Time  during the  execution  or tactical phase of training,
operations, emergency/crisis response situations, or off-duty activities where
there is normally little or no time to conduct formal/deliberate risk
management planning. Real-time is usually an informal, mental risk assessment
that is done  on the fly  (i.e. shortnotice taskings, weather/natural phenomena
driven activities, emergency responses, spontaneous off-duty activities, etc.)
using basic risk management process steps to identify and mitigate hazards in
the new or changing situation. As time is normally constrained or limited in
these situations, deliberate risk management planning is impractical.
Imperative to the Real-Time situations, is that individuals are able to
efficiently and effectively apply risk management concepts to mitigate risks.
To enhance recall of critical risk management steps, the Air Force has adopted
an easy to remember mnemonic (ABCD discussed in paragraph 16.39.4.) to assist
personnel in making sound risk management decisions during  Real-Time  and to
provide a description of the Air Force real-time risk management process that
is appropriate during the  execution  of a mission or activity and/or
time-constrained situations.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.&nbsp;<b>5-Step Risk Management Process.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Risk
Management is a continuous, systematic decision informing process consisting of
five primary steps (Figure 16.4) that define the formal risk management process
primarily associated with deliberative risk management planning and forms the
basis for real-time risk management process considerations. The following is a
brief description of the 5-Step risk management process:</span></p>

<p align="right"><span><img border="0" width="264" height="237" src="afh1_files/image246.png" ></span><b><span>Figure 16.4. 5-Step Risk Management</span></b></p>

<p><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>16.39.3.1.&nbsp;<b>(Step
1) Identify the Hazards.</b>&nbsp;Step one of the risk&nbsp;<b>Process.&nbsp;</b>management
process involves application of appropriate hazard identification techniques in
order to identify hazards associated with the operation or activity. Hazards
can be defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission
degradation, injury, illness, death to personnel or damage to or loss of
equipment/property. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.1.1.
Mission/Task Analysis: Review current and planned operations and/or tasks
associated with the mission or activity.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.1.2. List
Hazards: Identify and list hazards and/or factors that may lead to dangers and
risks associated with the operation or activity.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.1.3. List
Causes: List the causes associated with each identified hazard, and try to
identify the root cause(s) against which to apply risk management strategies.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.2. (<b>Step
2) Assess the Hazards.&nbsp;</b>The assessment step involves the application of
quantitative and/or qualitative measures to determine the probability and
severity of negative effects that may result from exposure to risks/hazards and
directly affect mission or activity success. Assessing hazards can be a
formalized or intuitive process. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.2.1. Assess
Hazard Exposure: Evaluate the time, proximity, volume or repetition involved to
determine the level of exposure to hazards.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.2.2. Assess
Hazard Severity: Determine severity of the hazard in terms of potential impact
on personnel, equipment, or mission/activity.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.2.3. Assess
Probability: Determine the probability that the hazard will cause a negative
event of the severity assessed above. Probability may be determined through
estimates or actual numbers (if available).</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.2.4. Assess
Risk Levels: Determine the level of risk associated with the hazard as related
to Severity and</span></p>

<p><span>Probability. The
level of risk will vary from  extremely high  as associated with frequent
exposure and catastrophic effects to  low  as associated with unlikely exposure
and negligible effects.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.2.5.
Complete Risk Assessment: Combine severity and probability estimates to form a
risk assessment for each hazard. By combining the probability of occurrence
with severity, a matrix is created where intersecting rows and columns define a
Risk Assessment Matrix. Figure 16.5 provides one example of a Risk Assessment
Matrix; color coding, coupled with numeric values is one way to ensure the
matrix is readable in both color and grayscale formats. Risk Assessment
Matrices can take different forms and must be designed to fit the organization
or situation as warranted. Note: A complete and in-depth description of the
Risk Assessment Matrix can be found in<i>&nbsp;</i>AFPAM 90-803,&nbsp;<i>Risk
Management (RM) Guidelines and Tools</i>.</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="566" height="368" src="afh1_files/image247.png" ></span><b><span>Figure 16.5. Sample Risk Assessment Matrix</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.3.&nbsp;<b>(Step
3) Develop Controls and Make Decisions:&nbsp;</b>Step three involves the
development and selection of specific strategies and controls that reduce or
eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the three
components (Probability, Severity or Exposure) of risk. Risk mitigation decisions
must be made at the appropriate level for the identified risk. The higher the
risk, the higher the decision-level needs to be to ensure that an appropriate
analysis of overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. Keep in mind
there is no  cookie-cutter  approach or specific standard for establishing
levels of risk management decision authority across the Air Force. Critical is
that leadership/decision makers ensure the levels of decision authority are
aligned appropriately for mission requirements and experience levels of the
personnel conducting operations/activities under their responsibility. Decision
levels may vary within a command for differing operations/activities if
training requirements, mission sets or activities are divergent enough to
warrant separate standards (for example, Air Education and Training Command,
Air Force Special Operations Command, etc.). Decision makers must ultimately
choose the most mission supportive risk controls, consistent with risk
management principles that provide the best solution for the given hazards.
Risk decisions must never be delegated to a lower level for convenience or when
the situation dictates senior-level involvement; exceptions may be considered
in time critical situations where delays might endanger lives, resources or
equipment. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.3.1.
Identify Control Options: Starting with the highest-risk hazards as assessed in
Step 2, identify as many risk control options as possible for all hazards. Each
hazard should have one or more controls that can effectively eliminate, avoid,
or reduce the risk to an acceptable level.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.3.2.
Determine Control Effects: Determine the effect of each control on the risk(s)
associated with the hazard. With controls identified, the hazard should be
re-assessed taking into consideration the effect the control will have on the
severity and or probability. This refined risk assessment determines the
residual risk for the hazard (assuming the implementation of selected
controls). At this point, consider the cost (personnel, equipment, money, time,
etc.) of the control and the possible interaction between controls; do they
work together?</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.3.3.
Prioritize Risk Controls: For each hazard, prioritize those risk controls that
will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The best controls will be
consistent with mission objectives and optimize use of available resources
(manpower, material, equipment, funding, time).</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.3.4. Select
Risk Controls: For each identified hazard, select those risk controls that will
reduce the risk to an acceptable level. As in prioritizing controls, the best
controls will be consistent with mission/activity objectives and optimum use of
available resources (outlined above).</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.3.5. Make
Risk Control Decision: Analyze the level of risk for the operation/activity
with the proposed controls in place. Determine if the benefits of the
operation/activity now exceed the level of risk the operation/activity
presents. Be sure to consider the cumulative risk of all the identified hazards
and the long term consequences of the decision. If the cost of the risk(s)
outweighs the benefits, re-examine the control options to see if any new or
modified controls are available. If no additional controls are identified,
inform the next level in the chain of command that, based on the evaluation,
the risk of the mission exceeds the benefits and should be modified. When
notified of a situation in which risk outweighs the benefit, the next level in
the chain of command must assist and implement required controls, modify/cancel
the mission, or accept the identified risks based on a higher level of the
risk-benefit equation. Keep in mind that as circumstances change for a given
mission/activity, the benefit-torisk comparison must also be made to ensure
that previous  Go/No-Go  decisions are valid.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.4.<b>&nbsp;(Step
4) Implement Controls.&nbsp;</b>Once control measures have been selected, an
implementation strategy must be developed and carried out. The strategy must
identify the: who, what, when, where and costs associated with the control
measure. For mission-related controls, accountability must be emphasized across
all levels of leadership and personnel associated with the action so that there
is clear understanding of the risks and responsibilities of commanders and
subordinates alike. There must always be accountability for acceptance of risk
regardless of circumstances. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.4.1. Make
Implementation Clear: Provide a roadmap for implementation, a vision of the end
state, and describe successful implementation. Deployed the control measure in
a method the intended audience can understand.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.4.2.
Establish Accountability: Accountability is a critically important area of risk
management. The accountable person is the one who makes the decision (approves
the control measures), and hence, the right person (appropriate level) must
make the decision. Also, be clear on who is responsible at the unit or
execution level for implementation of the risk control. Individuals involved in
a specific risk management process must be aware of who is responsible and
accountable at each stage of an operation/activity and when (if possible)
decisions will be elevated to the next level.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.4.3.
Provide Support: To be successful, command/leadership must be behind the
control measure(s) put in place. Provide the personnel and resources necessary
to implement the control measures. Incorporate sustainability from the
beginning and be sure to deploy the control measure along with a feedback
mechanism that will provide information on whether the control measure is
achieving the intended purpose.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.<b>&nbsp;(Step
5) Supervise and Evaluate.&nbsp;</b>Risk management is a process that continues
throughout the life cycle of a system, mission, or activity. Leaders and
supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles to ensure
controls are sustained over time. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.1.
Supervise: Monitor the operation/activity to ensure:</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.1.1. The
controls are effective and remain in place.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.1.2.
Changes which require further risk management are identified.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.1.3.
Action is taken when necessary to correct ineffective risk controls and
reinitiate the risk management steps in response to new hazards.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.1.4. Risk
and controls are re-evaluated anytime the personnel, equipment, or
mission/activity change or new actions are anticipated in an environment not
covered in the initial risk management analysis.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.1.5. There
is continuity of selected risk management controls during leadership changes.
Ensuring outgoing leaders share knowledge, experiences, and lessons with
incoming leaders provides positive transition of risk acceptance and less
volatility to the operation or activity when these changes occur.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.2.
Evaluate: The risk management process review/evaluation must be systematic.
After assets are expended to control risks, a cost benefit review must be
accomplished to see if risk and cost are in balance. Significant changes in the
system are recognized and appropriate risk management controls are reapplied as
necessary to control the risks. Effective review/evaluation will also identify
whether actual costs are in line with expectations and how the controls have
affected mission performance (good or bad). Other considerations:</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.2.1.
Every risk analysis will unlikely be perfect the first time. When risk analyses
contain errors of omission or commission, it is important that those errors be
identified and corrected.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.2.2.
Measurements are necessary to ensure accurate evaluations of how effectively
controls eliminate hazards or reduce risks. When available, After-Action
reports, surveys, and in-progress reviews are excellent tools for measurements.
To be meaningful, measurements must quantitatively or qualitatively identify
reductions of risk, improvements in mission success, or enhancement of
capabilities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.3.5.3.
Feedback: A review by itself is not enough; a feedback system must be established
to ensure that the corrective or preventative action taken was effective and
that any newly discovered hazards identified during the mission/activity are
analyzed and corrective action taken. Feedback informs all involved as to how
the implementation process is working and whether or not the controls were
effective. Feedback can be in the form of briefings, lessons learned,
cross-tell reports, benchmarking, database reports, etc. Without this feedback
loop, we lack the benefit of knowing if the previous forecasts were accurate,
contained errors, or were completely incorrect. Commanders, supervisors and
individuals must work with appropriate risk management process managers,
Instructors/Advisors to ensure effective risk management feedback and cross tell
is collected and distributed to enhance future operations, and activities.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.4.<b>&nbsp;Real-Time Risk Management Process or ABCD<i>&nbsp;</i>Model.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The 5-Step risk
management Process is the cornerstone of all risk management decisions and lays
the framework for conducting formalized risk assessments normally associated
with the deliberative level of risk management. Although real-time risk
management is also founded on the 5-Step risk management process, streamlining
the steps is essential in situations where risk decisions need to be made
quickly and in Real-Time. The real-time risk management process or ABCD model
provides individuals with an easy to remember mnemonic that walks them through
the essential steps of the RM wheel to:  <span><b><u>A</u></b></span>ssess
the situation,&nbsp;<span><b><u>B</u></b></span>alance controls,&nbsp;<span><b><u>C</u></b></span>ommunicate, and&nbsp;<span><b><u>D</u></b></span>ecide and&nbsp;<span><b><u>D</u></b></span>ebrief
the risk management decision:&nbsp;<b>ABCD</b>.  This simple and easy to
remember memory jogger provides individuals with a means to evaluate risks and
formulate mitigation strategies in a short time and can be easily applied in
both on- and off-duty situations. Figure 16.6 provides a graphic example of the
relationship between the 5-Step risk management Process and real-time risk
management process using the ABCD model.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.4.1.<b>&nbsp;Assess
the Situation.</b></span><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span><span>Assessing
risk in a time-critical environment</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>typically occurs</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>when a planned activity is already underway
or when the complexity or perception of overall risk is low. Effective
assessment requires the key elements of hazard/risk identification and
understanding the negative effects associated with those hazards/risks.
Individuals must seriously consider the activity or action in which they are
about to engage and choose appropriate mitigation strategies to meet the
hazards they identify. In real-time risk management process, a complete
assessment of the situation requires three stages of situational awareness in a
relatively short time: (a) Perception of what is happening; (b) Integration of
information and goals; and (c) Projection into the future. Unlike Deliberate
risk management, where there is ample time to assess potential situations, an
individual's ability to discern the situation and apply available resources
quickly and effectively that can mean the difference between success or
failure. This first step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model
effectively combines the first two steps of the 5-Step risk management Process.</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="374" height="329" src="afh1_files/image248.png" ></span><span>16.39.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Balance Controls.&nbsp;</b>The
second step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is specifically
tied to making risk control decisions (Step 3 of the 5-Step risk management
process) to mitigate or eliminate the risks identified in assessing the hazards
of the activity. After assessing the situation, personnel must consider all
available controls (resources) to facilitate mission or activity success and
how to manage them. Controls/resources can vary in scope and availability from
situation to situation. The better-prepared individuals are prior to an
activity, the more likely they will have more controls/resources available to
create multiple redundancies or  blocks' to effectively eliminate or mitigate
potential risks in real-time. As an example, this equates to having a good
understanding of the situation, being properly trained, wearing correct
personal protective equipment, knowing personal limitations, and having a
 Wingman  to support their effort. Each of these controls/resources serves as a
layer of protection and enhances a decision maker's ability to balance risk
versus reward through proper preparation and understanding of the situation and
options. When making these considerations, Airmen must communicate with their
team and leadership to ensure all options and resources are effectively
utilized in making a sound, yet timely risk decision.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.4.3.<b>&nbsp;Communicate.&nbsp;</b>The
third step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is to
communicate. This communication can take various forms such as Real-Time
communication with leadership to discuss problems and/or intentions, internal
team/crew communication to discuss Real-Time hazards and mitigation options, or
an individual internalizing their current situation and taking time to evaluate
if they are heading down the right path. This step assumes individuals and/or
teams carefully consider options and controls available to them in Real-Time
situations, and that they are aware of how perception and communication skills
change in unanticipated and changing environments. Perception and communication
skills are adversely affected as individuals become increasingly stressed and
lose situational awareness. Feeling undo pressure to succeed or to continue
with a plan when anticipated conditions require  mid-stream  changes can have
similar effects on individuals and/or team members as they try to compensate.
In these high stress situations, communication skills diminish as individuals
channelize attention and lose awareness of the overall situation; they can
experience tunnel vision and be unable to multitask effectively to deal with
the changing circumstances. Understanding this, individuals and teams who are
thrust into these situations can better prepare, anticipate, and identify if
they or others are losing situational awareness and make corrections. This
awareness enables individuals to communicate with teammates and leadership in
Real-Time situations, and allows them to take a step back and reevaluate
options. Asking questions such as:  Who needs to know about the situation? 
 Who can help or assist?   Who can provide back-up?  or  Can this be done
differently?  are just a few examples of the considerations that must be made
prior to implementing a mitigation strategy in real-time. 16.39.4.4.<b>&nbsp;Decide
and Debrief:</b></span></p>

<p><span>16.39.4.4.1. The
final step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is to make the
decision to continue, modify or abandon the mission/activity based upon
Real-Time circumstances and conditions. Unlike step 4 of the 5-Step risk
management process where an implementation strategy is carefully developed and
carried out through identification of the who, what, when, where and cost
associated with the control prior to an activity, realtime risk management
process relies on the individual or small group taking immediate or near
immediate action to mitigate risk(s) in real-time. This aspect alone can make
real-time risk management process decisions riskier than deliberate risk
management decisions. Individuals must realize this and make every effort to
deliberately weigh risk decisions before taking action to ensure they are
selecting the best course of action.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.4.4.2.
Sometimes the original plan must be modified or changed to account for
unforeseen issues in order to assure success. Although minor changes or
modifications to a plan or strategy may be easily implemented, others may
require higher authority (if available) to properly weigh the risk and determine
the best course of action. Accountability under these circumstances rests
solely with the individual(s) involved in the activity and their responsibility
is to fully understand the scope and limits of their Go/No-Go decision and act
accordingly. As such, the acceptance of risk and associated consequences needs
to be taken seriously with the understanding that any adverse outcome from a
selected course of action may not only affect the individual, but greatly
impact loved ones, co-workers, and ultimately their valuable contribution to
the Air Force mission. Although the goal for any mission or activity is to
operate safely and achieve success, all Airmen must consider the possibility of
abandoning the mission or activity if the situation appears too risky or too
costly to continue and there are no reasonable options or strategies to
change/alter the circumstances in the time remaining to conduct the
mission/activity.</span></p>

<p><span>16.39.4.4.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>As
with the formal 5-Step risk management process, both leadership and personnel
involved in a mission/activity must ensure that the feedback loop or  debrief 
aspect of the  D<i> &nbsp;</i>is performed. This vital process step ensures
individuals follow through and complete the ABCD<i>&nbsp;</i>mnemonic loop by
identifying what worked, what did not work, and ensures documented lessons
learned are disseminated. Debriefs will improve performance, mitigate risks in
future activities, and are essential in completing the ABCD<i>&nbsp;</i>loop.
Asking questions such as:  Was our assessment accurate?   Were we lucky?   How
well did we use the controls/resources?   Was the communication effective?  and
 What can we do to improve the events in the future?  are a few examples of
questions that leaders, crews/teams, and individuals can ask in debriefs to
ensure future activities are improved and risks are reduced.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 16I Sexual
Assault</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>16.40. Air Force Policies and Procedures for Prevention of and
Response to Sexual Assault:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.40.1. Sexual
Assault Is a Crime.</span></p>

<p><span>The United States
Air Force does not tolerate sexual assault. Sexual assault is criminal conduct
that falls well short of the standards America expects of the men and women in
uniform and violates Air Force Core Values. Inherent in the Air Force Core Values
of Integrity First, Service Before Self and Excellence in All We Do, is
respect: selfrespect, mutual respect, and respect for the Air Force as an
institution.</span></p>

<p><span>16.40.2. Sexual
Assault.</span></p>

<p><span>The following
definition of sexual assault has been directed by the Department of Defense and
is for education and training purposes only. This definition does not affect in
any way the definition of any offense under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. Commanders are encouraged to consult with their staff judge advocate for
complete understanding of this definition in relation to the Uniform Code of
Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><i><span>Sexual assault
is defined as intentional sexual contact, characterized by the use of force,
threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or
cannot consent. As used in this Instruction, the term includes a broad category
of sexual offenses consisting of the following specific Uniform Code of
Military Justice offenses:<span>&nbsp;</span>rape, sexual
assault, aggravated sexual contact, abusive sexual contact, forcible sodomy
(forced oral or anal sex), or attempts to commit these offenses.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></i></p>

<p><i><span>Consent is
defined as words or overt acts indicating a freely given agreement to the
sexual conduct at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent
through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical
resistance or submission resulting from the accused's use of force, threat of
force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute consent. A current
or previous dating relationship or the manner of dress of the person involved
with the accused in the sexual conduct at issue shall not constitute consent.
There is no consent where the person is sleeping or incapacitated, such as due
to age, alcohol or drugs, or mental incapacity.</span></i></p>

<p><b><span>16.41. Installation Sexual Assault Response Coordinator.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Installation
sexual assault response coordinator is an Air Force civilian employee or Air
Force officer reporting to the installation Commander, who serves as the
commander's central point of contact at installation level or within a
geographic area to ensure appropriate care is coordinated and provided to adult
victims of sexual assault, perpetrated by someone other than the victim s
spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner, and
tracks the services provided to a victim from the initial report through final
disposition and resolution. The installation sexual assault response
coordinator ensures the implementation of the sexual assault prevention and
response program, to include sexual assault awareness, prevention and response
training. Installation sexual assault response coordinators are trained and
credentialed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.42. Victim Advocate:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.42.1. A victim
advocate provides non-clinical crisis intervention, referral, and ongoing
non-clinical support to adult sexual assault victims, perpetrated by someone
other than the victim's spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or unmarried
intimate partner. Support will include providing information on available options
and resources to victims. The victim advocate, on behalf of the sexual assault
victim, provides liaison assistance with other organizations and agencies on
victim care matters and reports directly to the sexual assault response
coordinator when performing victim advocacy duties. The Air Force has two types
of victim advocates: sexual assault prevention and response victim advocates
and Volunteer victim advocates. Both will be trained and credentialed.</span></p>

<p><span>16.42.1.1. The
sexual assault prevention and response victim advocate is a fulltime general
service civilian employee selected and trained by the sexual assault response
coordinator, who provides essential support, liaison services and care to
victims.</span></p>

<p><span>16.42.1.2.
Volunteer victim advocates are military and Department of Defense civilian
employee volunteers selected and trained by the sexual assault response
coordinator, who provide essential support, liaison services and care to
victims. The victim advocate reports directly to the sexual assault response
coordinator while carrying out sexual assault advocacy responsibilities.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.43 Reporting Options.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force is
committed to ensuring adult victims are protected, treated with dignity and
respect, and provided support, advocacy, and care. To achieve these objectives,
the Air Force has two reporting options: Unrestricted and Restricted Reporting.
Unrestricted Reporting of sexual assault allegations activate victim services
and accountability responses, and are essential to eliminating the crime.
However, in some cases Unrestricted Reporting may represent a barrier for
victims to access services, when the victim desires no command or Air Force law
enforcement involvement. Consequently, the Air Force recognizes a fundamental
need to provide a confidential disclosure vehicle via the Restricted Reporting
option. Airmen who make a Restricted Report have access to all victim care
services, but no investigation will be opened and the chain-of-command will not
be notified. Regardless of whether the victim elects restricted or unrestricted
reporting, confidentiality of medical information will be maintained.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.44. Special Victims' Counsel.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In 2013, the Air
Force created the first program to provide adult and child victims of sexual
assault with legal representation to assist them. Special Victims' Counsel
provide legal assistance services through experienced, licensed, and
independent legal counsel from the reporting process, in the investigation,
during the prosecution, and through the appellate process.<span>&nbsp;</span>Sexual
Assault Response Coordinators, military criminal investigators, trial counsel
and victim witness liaison personnel must inform a sexual assault victim that
they have the opportunity to be represented free of charge. A sexual assault
victim may request Special Victims' Legal Counsel representation at any time.
Special Victims' Counsel deliver victim-centered advice and advocacy through
comprehensive, independent representation to sexual assault victims worldwide,
assist them in obtaining support and recovery resources, and promote greater
confidence in the military justice process and the United States Air
Force.&nbsp;<span><b>&nbsp;</b></span></span></p>

<p><b><span>16.45. Response to an Allegation of Sexual Assault:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.45.1. Any
military member or civilian employee, other than those authorized to receive
confidential communications or otherwise exempted by operation of law,
regulation, or policy, who receives a report of a sexual assault incident about
a subordinate in the individual's supervisory chain will report the matter to
the sexual assault response coordinator, Commander, and Air Force Office of
Special Investigations. Failure to comply may result in administrative action
or action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Military members or
civilian employees who become aware of a sexual assault incident, not involving
a subordinate in the supervisory chain, are strongly encouraged, but not
required to report the incident to the installation sexual assault response
coordinator or encourage the victim to do so.</span></p>

<p><span>16.45.2. Upon
notification, the sexual assault response coordinator will immediately respond
or direct a trained and credentialed victim advocate to respond to the victim.
When contacted by the sexual assault response coordinator and/or victim
advocate, a sexual assault victim may decline any or all sexual assault
prevention and response services or request a different advocate, to include
gender specific, if one is available. Unless assistance is declined, the sexual
assault response coordinator and/or victim advocate will provide the victim
accurate information on the sexual assault response process, including the
option of unrestricted or restricted reporting, as applicable. The sexual
assault response coordinator and/or victim advocate will inform the victim of
the availability of healthcare treatment, including the option of a sexual
assault forensic examination, and a Special Victims Counsel.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.46. Reporting Option Eligibility:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.46.1. The
following individuals are eligible for both the Unrestricted and Restricted
Reporting option within the SAPR Program.</span></p>

<p><span>16.46.1.1. Regular
Air Force members who were victims of sexual assault perpetrated by an
acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner), victim's spouse, same sex
domestic partner, and/or unmarried intimate partner.</span></p>

<p><span>16.46.1.1.1.
Military members, who are on Regular Air Force, but who were victims of sexual
assault prior to enlistment or commissioning, are eligible to receive sexual
assault prevention and response services under either reporting option. Support
to an Regular Air Force service member is available regardless of when or where
the sexual assault took place.</span></p>

<p><span>16.46.1.2. Regular
Air Force members' dependents, 18 and older, who are eligible for treatment in
the medical healthcare system, at installations in the continental United
States and outside of the continental United States, by an acquaintance or
stranger (non-intimate partner), victim's spouse, same sex domestic partner,
and/or unmarried intimate partner.</span></p>

<p><span>16.46.1.3. Air
Force Reserve component members in Title 10 status who are sexually assaulted
when performing active service and inactive duty training will be eligible to
receive full sexual assault prevention and response support services from a
sexual assault response coordinator and/or volunteer victim advocate.</span></p>

<p><span>16.46.1.3.1. If
reporting a sexual assault that occurred prior to or while not performing
active service or inactive training when not in Title 10 status, Air Force
Reserve component members will be eligible to receive limited sexual assault
prevention and response support services from a sexual assault response
coordinator and/or victim advocate. Local laws and regulations apply when the
member is in Title 32 status.</span></p>

<p><span>16.46.1.4. Air
Force civilian employees who are victims of sexual assault regardless of their
duty station location.</span></p>

<p><span>16.46.1.4.1. Air
Force civilian employees who are victims of sexual assault are not eligible for
non-emergency medical services or legal services unless the reporting
individual is otherwise a beneficiary.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.47. Restricted Reports:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.47.1. The
Department of Defense has directed the implementation of confidentiality in the
form of a Restricted Reporting option. This enables eligible victims to report
allegations of sexual assault to specified personnel, without triggering an
investigation. This reporting option is intended to remove barriers to medical
care and support while giving the victim additional time and increased control
over the release and management of personal information.</span></p>

<p><span>16.47.2. The Air
Force makes every effort to treat victims of sexual assault with dignity and
respect, to protect their privacy to the maximum extent of the law, and provide
support, advocacy, and care.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.48. Receiving a Restricted Report:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.48.1. Only
sexual assault response coordinators, sexual assault prevention and response
victim advocates, volunteer victim advocates and Healthcare Personnel may
receive restricted reports of sexual assault. While communications with
chaplains or other individuals may be entitled to privileged status under the
Military Rules of Evidence or other statues and regulations, such
communications are not restricted reports. Chaplains and other individuals
entitled to privileged communications are not authorized to accept a report of
sexual assault; however communication related to the incident is protected.
Before such communications can be considered a restricted report, the
restricted report must be reported or forwarded to a sexual assault response
coordinator for determination of eligibility.</span></p>

<p><span>16.48.2. If a
victim tells Healthcare Personnel that a sexual assault has occurred, the
Healthcare Personnel will notify the sexual assault response coordinator in
cases of acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner) sexual assault. The
requirement of AFI 44-102,&nbsp;<i>Community Health Management</i>, to report
incidents of sexual assault to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
or other authorities as appropriate is expressly waived for restricted reports.</span></p>

<p><span>16.48.3. A victim
advocate who is contacted by a victim wishing to make a restricted report but
who has not been assigned by the sexual assault response coordinator to serve
as the victim advocate for that individual will not enter into a discussion of
the circumstances but will immediately refer the victim to the sexual assault response
coordinator. The victim advocate is not required to report the initial contact
to command or law enforcement.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.49. Notification to Command of a Restricted Report.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Within 24 hours of
receipt of a restricted report of an alleged acquaintance or stranger
(non-intimate partner) sexual assault, the sexual assault response coordinator
will notify the installation or host wing commander that a restricted report of
an alleged sexual assault has been made and provide only non-identifiable
information. Non-identifying information under the restricted reporting option
is intended to provide commanders with general environmental information about
the number and types of sexual assaults on the installation and is to be used
to provide a better understanding of incidents of sexual assault. Neither
commanders nor law enforcement may initiate investigations based on information
about restricted reports provided by sexual assault response coordinators.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.50.
Unrestricted Reports.&nbsp;</span></b><span>Any
report of a sexual assault made through normal reporting channels, including
the victim's chain of command, law enforcement, and the Air Force Office of
Special Investigations or other criminal investigative service is considered an
Unrestricted Report. Any report of sexual assault made through the sexual
assault response coordinator, victim advocate,</span></p>

<p><span>or Healthcare
Personnel by an individual who elects an Unrestricted Report and designates so
in writing on the Victim Reporting Preference Statement will be forwarded to
the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. The individual to whom the
Unrestricted Report was made will notify the sexual assault response
coordinator in cases of acquaintance or stranger (non-intimate partner) sexual
assault.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.51. Use of Information:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.51.1. In cases of
an unrestricted report of a sexual assault or information concerning a sexual
assault is otherwise known, information concerning the victim and the offense
will only be provided to governmental entities or persons with an established
official need to know. Those who are deemed to have an official need to know in
the Air Force routinely include: law enforcement; the commanders and first
sergeants of the victim and the alleged assailant; legal personnel; the sexual
assault response coordinator and victim advocate; and healthcare providers as
required to perform their respective duties. The intent of this restriction is
to protect the privacy of the victim.</span></p>

<p><span>16.51.2. Commanders
notified of a sexual assault through an Unrestricted Report must take immediate
steps to ensure the victim's physical safety, emotional security, and medical
treatment needs are met and that the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
or appropriate criminal investigative agency and sexual assault response
coordinator are notified (in cases of spouse, same sex domestic partner, and/or
unmarried intimate partner sexual assaults are referred to Air Force Family
Advocacy Program). The appropriate commanders should determine whether
temporary reassignment or relocation of the victim or alleged assailant is
appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>16.51.3. In cases
where the victim consults the sexual assault response coordinator, prior to
disclosure to the chain of command, law enforcement, Air Force Office of
Special Investigations, or other criminal investigative service, and the victim
does not elect a reporting option,</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>the sexual assault response coordinator is
not under any obligation or duty to inform investigators or commanders about
the report and will not produce the report or disclose the communications surrounding
the report.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.52. Addressing Victim Collateral Misconduct in Sexual Assault
Cases:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.52.1. An
investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding an alleged sexual
assault may produce evidence that the victim engaged in misconduct like underage
drinking or other related alcohol offenses, adultery, drug abuse,
fraternization, or other violations of instructions, regulations, or orders.
According to the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, the&nbsp;<i>Manual for
Courts-Martial</i>, and Air Force instructions, commanders are responsible for
addressing misconduct in a manner that is consistent and appropriate to the
circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span>16.52.2. Commanders
have the authority to determine the appropriate disposition of alleged victim
misconduct, to include deferring disciplinary action until after disposition of
the sexual assault case. When considering what corrective actions may be
appropriate, commanders must balance the objectives of holding members
accountable for their own misconduct with the intent to avoid unnecessary
additional trauma to sexual assault victims and the goal of encouraging
reporting of sexual assaults. The gravity of any collateral misconduct by the
victim, and the impact on good order and discipline, should be carefully
considered in deciding what, if any, corrective action is appropriate.
Commanders should consult with the servicing staff judge advocate prior to
taking any action regarding collateral misconduct.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.53. Prevention and Response for the Deployed Environment:</span></b></p>

<p><span>16.53.1. The Air Force
will identify trained military sexual assault response coordinators (and/or
trained civilian sexual assault response coordinators who volunteer) for Air
Expeditionary Force rotational support for global contingency operations
consistent with requirements established by the commander of Air Force forces.
Normally, each Air Expeditionary Wing will warrant at least one sexual assault
response coordinator requirement. For deployments smaller than an Air
Expeditionary Force, deployed commanders must provide a sexual assault response
capability consistent with Air Force requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>16.53.2. Home
station unit commanders must ensure Air Force members are trained on both
annual sexual assault and response training requirements and pre-deployment
prior to any deployment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>16.54. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This chapter
discussed some of the aspects of wing support including the Air Force Portal,
military pay and allowances, leave management, LeaveWeb, military equal
opportunity, legal services, ground safety, risk management, and policies and
procedures for prevention of and response to sexual assault. Supervisors need
to ensure their Airmen understand the value of applying the knowledge outlined
in this chapter.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>Chapter 17</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>DRESS AND APPEARANCE</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 17A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>17.1. Introduction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>17.1.1.
Dress and personal appearance standards immediately identify us as United
States Air Force Airmen. These standards are intended to ensure all Airmen
maintain a distinctive, plain, standardized appearance. Deeply rooted in our
Air Force heritage our dress and personal appearance standards provide visible
examples of self-discipline, commitment and a willingness to set aside
individuality for the betterment of the whole. Wearing the Air Force uniform
means carrying on a tradition that identifies the person as a member of a
historical profession, a close-knit society, quietly assured of his or her
competence and professionalism.</span></p>

<p><span>17.1.2.
The Air Force uniform developed slowly into what is worn today. During this
evolution, the uniform design changed from one with many devices and
accouterments to one with very few embellishments. The present Air Force
uniform with authorized badges, insignia, and devices is plain yet distinctive,
presenting the appearance of a military professional. Wearing the Air Force
uniform means carrying on a tradition one that identifies the person as a
member of a historical profession, a close-knit society, quietly assured of his
or her competence and professionalism. This chapter identifies the most common
uniform items and combinations for enlisted members.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Consult
AFI 36-2903,&nbsp;<i>Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel</i>,
for official guidance.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 17B Individual
Responsibilities</span></i></b></p>

<p><span>All
Air Force members in uniform will adhere to standards of neatness, cleanliness,
safety, uniformity, military image, and present the appearance of a disciplined
service member. Air Force members will procure and maintain all mandatory
clothing items, follow local supplements and procedures, and keep uniforms
neat, clean, pressed, buttoned, and properly maintained. Members will not stand
or walk with hands in pockets of any uniform combination (other than to insert
or remove items). While walking in uniform use of personal electronic media
devices, including ear pieces, speaker phones or text messaging is limited to
emergencies or when official notifications are necessary. Military customs and
courtesies take precedence. (<b>Exception:</b>&nbsp;Earphones are authorized
during individual physical training when wearing the physical training
uniform.) Air Force members will not smoke or use smokeless tobacco products,
drink, or eat while walking in uniform. This also applies when Airmen are
required to wear civilian clothes to perform assigned duties.</span></p>

<p><b><span>17.2. When to Wear the Uniform:</span></b></p>

<p><span>17.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Military Duties.</b></span></p>

<p><span>As
a rule, Air Force members must wear a uniform while performing military duties.
Installation commanders will provide (at no cost) to enlisted members required
organizational and functional items directed for wear. When members perform duty
on other services' installations, they must comply with order of dress for that
service, provided their standards are not less restrictive than the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>17.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Traveling.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Wearing
a uniform is optional when a member is departing from a military airfield on
Department of Defense aircraft or United States government commercial
contracted flights. Those who choose to wear civilian clothing will ensure
items are neat, clean, and appropriate for inflight operations, the mode of
travel, and the destination. Examples of inappropriate clothing include:
ripped, torn, frayed, or patched clothing; tank tops, shorts, short skirts,
undergarments worn as outer garment, bathing suits, and any garments which are
revealing or display obscene, profane, or lewd words or drawings. The Airman
Battle Uniform (ABU) is acceptable when traveling between military
installations.</span></p>

<p><b><span>17.3. Uniform Wear Restrictions.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airmen
will not wear uniform items that do not meet Air Force specifications.
Additionally, Air Force members may not wear uniform items to further political
activities; for private employment or commercial interests; while participating
in public speeches, interviews, picket lines, marches or rallies; or at any
public demonstration when the perception may exist that the Air Force sanctions
the cause.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>17.4. Personal Grooming Standards:</span></b></p>

hair must have a tapered appearance on the sides and back, both with and
without headgear. Hair will not exceed 1  inches in bulk, regardless of length,
and will not exceed   inch at the natural termination point. Hairstyles that

hair will not touch the ears; only closely cut or shaved hair on the back of
the neck may touch the collar. The block cut is permitted with tapered
appearance. Men are also authorized cleanly shaven heads, military
high-and-tight, or flattop haircuts. Men will not have any visible items in, or
attached to, their hair.</span></p>

<p><span>17.4.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Women.</b>&nbsp;Women
must style their hair to present a professional appearance. Hair will not be
worn in an extreme or faddish style, or violate safety requirements. Hair
cannot extend below an invisible line drawn parallel to the ground at the
bottom edge of the shirt collar, regardless of length. Hairstyles may include
wear of conservative hairpins, combs, headbands, elastic bands, scrunchies, and
barrettes. However, the items must match the individual's hair color. Women may
not have shaved heads, military high-and-tight, or flat-top haircuts. Minimum
length is   inch, and hair will not exceed 3 inches in bulk. Long hair worn in
a bun will be secured with no loose ends. When hair is in a ponytail, the hair
must be pulled all the way through the elastic band, hang naturally downward,
and not extend below the collar. Bangs and side-swept hair will not touch the
eyebrows.</span></p>

<p><span>17.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Beards, Mustaches, and Sideburns
(Men):</b></span></p>

<p><span>17.4.2.1.
Beards are not worn except when authorized by a commander, on the advice of a
medical official, for health reasons. If authorized by the commander, members
must keep facial hair trimmed not to exceed   inch in length. If granted a
shaving waiver, members will not shave any facial hair in a manner as to give a
sculptured appearance. Commanders and supervisors will monitor treatment
progress to control shaving waivers.</span></p>

<p><span>17.4.2.2. Mustaches, if
worn, will not extend downward beyond the lip line of the upper lip or extend
sideways beyond a vertical line drawn upward from both corners of the mouth.</span></p>

<p><span>17.4.2.3.

clean-shaven horizontal line. They will not extend below the bottom of the
orifice of the ear opening.</span></p>

<p><span>17.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Cosmetics (Women).</b></span></p>

<p><span>Cosmetics must be
conservative and in good taste and will not be worn in field conditions.</span></p>

<p><span>17.4.4.&nbsp;<b>Fingernails.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Fingernails must be
clean, well-groomed, not exceed   inch in length past tip of finger, and not
interfere with duty performance or hinder proper fit of prescribed safety
equipment or uniform items.</span></p>

<p><span>17.4.5.&nbsp;<b>Nail Polish (Women).</b></span></p>

<p><span>When worn, nail polish
will be a single color that complements skin tone. Bright red, orange, purple,
black, and other extreme colors are not authorized. Decorations are prohibited,
but French manicures are authorized.</span></p>

<p><b><span>17.5. Tattoos and Brands:</span></b></p>

<p><span>17.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Unauthorized Types.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Tattoos and brands,
anywhere on the body, that are obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic, or
religious discrimination or commonly associated with gangs, extremist, and/or
supremacist organizations, are prohibited in and out of uniform. Tattoos and brands
that are prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a nature that tends to
bring discredit upon the Air Force are prohibited in and out of uniform.</span></p>





<p><span>17.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Inappropriate Types.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Excessive
tattoos and brands must not be exposed or visible (includes being visible
through the uniform) while in uniform. Excessive is defined as any tattoo or
brand that exceeds   coverage of the exposed body part and those above the
collarbone and readily visible when wearing an open-collar uniform.</span></p>

<p><span>17.5.3.<b>&nbsp;Violations.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Failure to observe the
mandatory provisions listed below are a violation of Article 92, Uniform Code
of Military Justice. Violations for the following types of tattoos and brands
are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span>17.5.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Unauthorized.</b>&nbsp;Any
member who obtains unauthorized tattoos will be required to remove them at his
or her own expense. Depending on the circumstances, commanders may seek Air
Force medical support for voluntary tattoo removal. Members who fail to remove
unauthorized tattoos in a timely manner will be subject to involuntary
separation.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>17.5.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Inappropriate.</b>&nbsp;Members
are not allowed to display excessive tattoos that would detract from an
appropriate professional image while in uniform. Commanders will use AFI
36-2903 to assist in determining appropriate military image and acceptability
of tattoos displayed by members in uniform. Air Force members with existing
tattoos that do not meet standards must keep them completely covered using
current uniform items (for example, long-sleeved shirt or blouse, pants or
slacks, dark hosiery, etc.) or volunteer to remove tattoos. Members who do not
comply with these requirements are subject to disciplinary action.</span></p>

<p><b><span>17.6. Body Piercing.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Body piercing standards
are provided below:</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>&nbsp;In uniform, women are authorized to wear

body part (includes being visible through clothing).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>17.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Imposing More Restrictive
Standards.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Major
command commander's may impose more restrictive standards for
tattoos/brands/body markings and body ornaments, on or off duty, in those
locations where Air Force-wide standards may not be adequate to address
cultural sensitivities (e.g., overseas). Additionally, major command commanders
may impose more restrictive standards on those performing highly visible
special mission requirements or special duty positions (for example, more
restrictive standards for permanently assigned recruiters, reserve officer
training corps cadre, Officer Training School cadre, United States Air Force
Academy cadre, military training instructors, military training leaders,
instructors in any training environment, etc.).</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></b><span>According
to AFI 36-2903, individuals are prohibited from intentionally pursuing body
alterations or modifications that result in a visible, physical effect that

<p align="center"><b><span>FIT FORCE</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This
chapter covers the fitness program, proper nutrition, substance abuse, tobacco
use, suicide prevention, posttraumatic stress disorder, reintegration from
deployment, medical care, and the Wingman concept. Air Force members must be
physically fit to support the Air Force mission. Commanders and supervisors
must incorporate fitness into the Air Force culture to establish an environment
for members to maintain physical fitness and health to meet expeditionary
mission requirements and deliver a fit-and-ready force. The annual fitness
assessment provides commanders with a tool to assist in the determination of
overall fitness of their military personnel.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18B Physical
Fitness and Fitness Components</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.2. Physical Fitness, Optimal Performance and
Mission Readiness.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Adequate
physical fitness levels ensure every Airman can properly support the Air Force
mission while performing at optimal capacity. The goal of the fitness program
is to motivate all members to participate in a year-round physical conditioning
program emphasizing total fitness to include proper aerobic conditioning,
muscular fitness training, and healthy eating. An active lifestyle will
increase productivity, optimize health, and decrease absenteeism while
maintaining a higher level of readiness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.3. Physical Fitness.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The five major
components of fitness are cardiorespiratory endurance, body composition,
muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility. Warm-up and cool down
are also essential components of a complete physical fitness program.</span></p>

<p><span>18.3.1. Cardiorespiratory
endurance is the ability to perform large muscle, dynamic, moderate-to-high
intensity exercise for prolonged periods.</span></p>

<p><span>18.3.2. Body composition
is the relative portion of the body comprised of fat and fat-free tissue.</span></p>

<p><span>18.3.3. Muscular strength
is the maximum force generated by a specific muscle or muscle group.</span></p>

<p><span>18.3.4. Muscular
endurance is the ability of a muscle group to execute repeated contractions
over a period of sufficient time duration to cause muscular fatigue.</span></p>

<p><span>18.3.5. Flexibility is
the maximum ability to move a joint freely, without pain, through a range of
motion.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.4. Aerobic Fitness.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A successful
cardiorespiratory endurance exercise program should address modality (type of
exercise), volume (frequency multiplied by duration) and intensity.</span></p>

<p><span>18.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Mode.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Select
activities that involve a large proportion of total muscle mass, maximize use
of large muscles, (<i>e.g</i>.<i>,&nbsp;</i>muscles around the thigh and hip),
involve dynamic, rhythmic muscle contractions, and minimize static (no
movement) contraction and use of small muscles. Examples are running, cycling,
swimming, rowing, jogging, vigorous walking, indoor aerobic exercise machines,
and some sports&nbsp;<i>if</i>&nbsp;they are continuous in nature.</span></p>

<p><span>18.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Volume (frequency multiplied by
duration).</b></span></p>

<p><span>Accomplish
moderately intense aerobic activity 30 minutes a day, five days a week&nbsp;<i>or&nbsp;</i>vigorously
intense aerobic activity 20 minutes to 25 minutes a day, 3 days a week&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>muscle
fitness exercise (see below), or an equivalent combination of moderately and
vigorously intense aerobic activity. For additional and more extensive health
and fitness benefits, accomplish moderately intense aerobic activity 300
minutes (5 hours) a week, or accomplish vigorously intense aerobic activity 150
minutes a week, or an equivalent combination. Generally, the minimal levels of
exercise volume and intensity above are necessary to maintain health and
fitness, while the higher levels are necessary to improve health and fitness.</span></p>

<p><span>18.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Intensity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Intensity
refers to how hard one exercises. Moderately intense aerobic activity equates
to continuous exercise that raises heart and respiratory rates, initiates
sweating (varies with climate), and permits conversation; vigorously intense
aerobic activity elicits higher physiological responses and permits light or
broken conversation. Intensity, considered the most important variable in
training, may be prescribed as a percentage of maximum velocity, or percentages
of physiological variables, i.e., a percent of maximal volume of oxygen
consumed (%VO</span><sub><span>2&nbsp;</span></sub><span>max) or percent of maximal heart rate (%heart
rate max). One formula for determining exercise intensity by heart rate is
presented in Figure 18.1.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 18.1. Heart Rate Formula.</span></b></p>

<p><span>220 - age = maximum
heart rate for Airmen under 40 years of age.</span></p>

<p><span>Max heart rate = 208  
0.7(age) for Airmen age 40 years and above.</span></p>

<p><span>Measure resting heart
rate for three to four days shortly after waking for a 60 second period, while
in the same body position each day. Take an average of the measures.</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Calculate heart rate range. Heart Rate Range = Maximal heart rate
  Resting heart rate.</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Calculate minimum, optimal (target), and do-not-exceed (safety)
exercise heart rates:</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Minimum exercise heart rate = (50% Heart Rate Range) + Resting
heart rate.</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Optimal exercise heart rate = (75% Heart Rate Range) + Resting
heart rate.</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Do-not-exceed exercise heart rate = (85% Heart Rate Range) +
Resting heart rate.</span></p>

<p><span>For example, a 30 year
old Air Force member with a Resting heart rate of 70 beats a minute calculates
Maximal heart rate as 220   30 = 190 beats a minute and heart rate Range as 190
  70 = 120. Applying the equations:</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Minimum exercise heart rate = 50% (120) + 70 = 60 + 70 = 130 beats
a minute.</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Optimal exercise heart rate = 75% (120) + 70 = 90 + 70 = 160 beats
a minute.</span></p>

<p><span>-</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Do-not-exceed exercise heart rate = 85% (120) + 70 = 102 + 70 =
172 beats/min.</span></p>

<p><span>Therefore, this
individual should keep exercise heart rate above 130 beats a minute, but below
172 beats a minute, targeting 160 beats a minute for at least 20 minutes to 25
minutes 3 days a week. Unfit individuals should start at the lower end of the
heart rate Range. As fitness level increases, the resting heart rate will
decrease, therefore increase the intensity percentage from low (50%) towards
optimal (75%). Also, base fitness personnel can help fine tune these
calculations taking into account medications, risk of injury, and individual
preferences and objectives.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.5. Muscular Strength and Endurance Training.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A successful strength
and endurance training program should include the principles of specificity,
regularity, recovery, balance, and variety.</span></p>

<p><span>18.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Principle of</b>&nbsp;<b>Specificity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
strength training program should provide resistance to specific muscle groups
that need to be strengthened. These groups can be identified by doing a simple
assessment of functional movement. The Airman slowly does workrelated or
functional movements he or she wants to improve upon. An example would be the
Airman whose job requires them to bend over, pick up an object, and place it in
an overhead position. This work-related task has the functional movement of a
squat and an overhead press with a weight. By incorporating these moves into a
strength training program, the Airman can improve strength and, therefore,
improve work-related tasks while reducing injuries by being conditioned in
those muscles needed to perform the work. If the Airman's performance of a task
is not adequate, or if he/she wishes to improve, strength training for the
identified muscles will be beneficial. In this way, he/she ensures maximum
carryover value to his/her warrior tasks.</span></p>

<p><span>18.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Principle of</b>&nbsp;<b>Regularity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Exercise
must be done regularly to produce a training effect. Sporadic exercise may do
more harm than good. Airmen can maintain a moderate level of strength by doing
proper strength workouts only once a week for a short period of time if they
have already established a strong baseline level of muscular fitness. However,
three workouts per week are best for optimal gains. The principle of regularity
also applies to the exercises for individual muscle groups. An Airman can work
out three times a week, but when different muscle groups are exercised at each
workout, the principle of regularity is violated and gains in strength are
minimal. Airmen should strive for exercising the same muscle group a minimum of
twice each week.</span></p>



<p><span>18.5.3.&nbsp;<b>Principle of</b>&nbsp;<b>Recovery.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Consecutive
days of hard resistance training for the same muscle group can be detrimental.
The muscles must be allowed sufficient recovery time to adapt. Strength training
may be done every day only if the exercised muscle groups are rotated, so the
same muscle or muscle group is not trained (exercised) on consecutive days.
There should be at least a 48-hour recovery period between workouts for the
same muscle groups. For example, the legs can be trained with weights on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and the upper body muscles on Tuesday, Thursday,
and Saturday. Recovery is also important within a workout. The recovery time
between different exercises and sets depends, in part, on the intensity of the
workout. Normally, the recovery time between sets should be 30-180
seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.5.4.&nbsp;<b>Principle of</b>&nbsp;<b>Balance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>When
developing a strength training program, remember the importance of including
exercises to work all the major muscle groups   in both the upper and lower
body. You should not work just the muscle groups in the upper body, with the
idea running will strengthen the legs. Most muscles are organized into opposing
pairs; activating one muscle results in a pulling motion, while activating the
opposing muscle results in the opposite or pushing movement. When planning a
training session, one training technique is to follow a pushing exercise with a
pulling exercise resulting in movement at the same joints. For example, follow
an overhead press with a lateral pull-down exercise. This technique helps
ensure good strength balance between opposing muscle groups which may, in turn,
reduce the risk of injury. Sequence the program to exercise the larger muscle
groups first, then the smaller muscles.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.5.5.&nbsp;<b>Principle of</b>&nbsp;<b>Variety.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Using
different equipment, changing the exercises, and altering the volume/intensity
are good ways to add variety   and they may also produce better results. The
Airmen should periodically substitute different exercises for given muscle
groups. For example, Airmen can do squats with a barbell instead of leg presses
on a weight machine. Also, for variety or due to necessity (for example, when
in the field), they can switch to partner-resisted exercises or another form of
resistance training. However, avoid frequent fundamental changes as Airmen may
become frustrated if they do not have enough time to adapt or to see
improvements in strength.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.6. Flexibility Training:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.6.1.
Flexibility is an important component of any fitness program. Many
activity-related injuries have their root in lack of flexibility. Think of
muscles as rubber bands. When they are cold, they are rigid and brittle. When
warm, they stretch and retract more easily. Conducting a good warm-up before
exercising and a good cool down upon completion will help prevent injury and
reduce muscle soreness.</span></p>

<p><span>18.6.2. Regardless of
your current fitness level, you should always begin your exercise sessions with
a warm-up and end it with a cool down. Recommendations are listed in paragraphs
18.8.1 and 18.8.2. below.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.7. Body Composition.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The two largest
contributing factors to maintaining a positive body composition are exercise
and diet.</span></p>

<p><span>18.7.1.
A combination of exercise and diet is the best way to lose excessive body fat.
Losing 1-2 pounds a week is a realistic goal best accomplished by reducing
caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure. In other words, eat less and
exercise more. Dieting alone can cause the body to believe the body is being starved.
In response, the body tries to conserve its fat reserves by slowing down its
metabolic rate and, as a result, loses at a slower rate.</span></p>

<p><span>18.7.2.
Airmen must consume a minimum number of calories from all the major food
groups, with the calories distributed over all the daily meals   including
snacks and drinks. This ensures an adequate consumption of necessary vitamins
and minerals. A male, not under medical supervision, requires a caloric intake
of at least 1,500; women require at least 1,200 calories and Airmen should
avoid diets failing to meet these criteria.</span></p>

<p><span>18.7.3. There is no
 quick and easy  way to improve body composition. Losing fat safely takes time
and patience.</span></p>

<p><span>18.7.4.
Exercise not only burn calories, but helps the body maintain its useful muscle
mass and may help keep the body's metabolic rate high during dieting. Fat is
best utilized during aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise, which uses lots of
oxygen, is the best type of activity for burning fat. Aerobic exercise includes
jogging, walking, swimming, bicycling, cross-country skiing, rowing, stair
climbing, and jumping rope. Anaerobic activities, such as sprinting or lifting
heavy weights, burn little, if any, fat.</span></p>





<p><b><span>18.8. Warm-up and Cool Down:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.8.1.&nbsp;<b>The Warm-up.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Before
beginning any vigorous physical activity, you should prepare your body for
exercise. The dynamic warmup increases the flow of blood to the muscles and
tendons, thus helping reduce the risk of injury and increasing the joint s
range of motion and positively affects the speed of muscular contraction. The
following is the recommended sequence of dynamic warm-up activities for 5-7
minutes before vigorous exercise:</span></p>

<p><span>18.8.1.1. Slowly jog in
place or walk for 1-2 minutes. This causes a gradual increase in the heart
rate, blood pressure, circulation, and increases the temperature of the active
muscles.</span></p>

<p><span>18.8.1.2. Slowly rotate
joints (for example, arm circles, knee and ankle rotations) to gradually
increase their range of motion; work each major joint for 5-10 seconds.</span></p>

<p><span>18.8.1.3. Slowly mimic
the activities to be performed. For example, lift a lighter weight to warm up
before lifting the heavier one; this helps prepare the neuromuscular pathways.
The dynamic warm-up increases the flow of blood to the muscles and tendons,
helping reduce the risk of injury, increasing the joint's range of motion, and
positively affects the speed of muscular contraction.</span></p>

<p><span>18.8.2.&nbsp;<b>Cool Down.</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.8.2.1.
Do not stop suddenly after vigorous exercise, but gradually bring your body
back to a resting state by slowly decreasing the intensity of the activity.
After running, for example, you should walk for 1-2 minutes. Stopping exercise
suddenly can cause blood to pool in the muscles, thereby reducing blood flow to
the heart and brain. This may cause fainting or abnormal heart rhythm and this
could lead to serious complications.</span></p>

<p><span>18.8.2.2.
Repeat the stretches done in your warm-up to help ease muscle tension and any
immediate feeling of muscle soreness; be careful not to  over-stretch . The muscles
are warm from activity and could be over-stretched to the point of injury.</span></p>

<p><span>18.8.2.3. Hold stretches
15-30 seconds or more during your cool down to improve flexibility.</span></p>

<p><span>18.8.2.4.
Do not limit flexibility training to the cool down periods. Stretching is one
form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits gained
and may be done easily at home or work. Repetitive movements at work or having
a more sedentary job can increase tension in specific muscle groups, which
would benefit from mild stretching during the course of the day.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.9. Unit Physical Fitness Training Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.9.1. Commander-driven
physical fitness training is the backbone of the Air Force physical fitness
program. The program promotes aerobic and muscular fitness, flexibility, and
optimal body composition of each Airman in the unit. Safety must be an
overarching concern throughout physical training and assessment.</span></p>

<p><span>18.9.2.
The program will meet the current ability level of the members while
encouraging and challenging members to progress to a higher fitness level. The
1.5-mile timed run, 2-kilometer walk, abdominal circumference, push-up, and
situp assessments are designed to measure the effectiveness of the physical
training program. However, training should not be limited to the assessment
activities.</span></p>

<p><span>18.9.3.
The unit fitness program will incorporate the guidelines established in AFI
36-2905,&nbsp;<i>Fitness Program</i>, to develop general fitness, prevent
boredom, and decrease repetitive strain injuries. Finally, the program must
ensure a safe environment for training by assessing traffic patterns, use of
headphones or other personal equipment, temperature, availability of water and
first aid, and awareness of emergency procedures. In addition, you should
consider individual safety issues, such as medical limitations and level of
ability.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.10. Physical Fitness Standard:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.10.1.
The Air Force uses a composite fitness score based on aerobic fitness, muscular
strength/endurance, and body composition (using abdominal circumference
measurements) to determine overall fitness. Overall fitness is directly related
to health risk, including risk of disease (morbidity) and death (mortality). A
composite score of 75 or greater, in addition to meeting the minimum component
scores, represents the minimum accepted for health, fitness, and readiness
levels. Health and readiness benefits continue to increase as body composition
improves and physical activity and fitness levels increase. Members are
encouraged to optimize their readiness status and posture by improving their
overall fitness. Age and gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in
AFI 36-2905, Attachment 10.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Meeting the minimum
component scores does not constitute the minimum points required to earn a
composite passing score. Scoring the minimum component values in all components
will not generate enough points to earn a composite score of 75 or greater.</span></p>

<p><span>The minimum components
are established to ensure members test adequately in all components and avoid
 asymmetrical fitness' (i.e. excelling in some and disregarding others).</span></p>

<p><span>18.10.2. Airmen will receive a composite score
on a 0-100 scale based on the following maximum component scores: 60 points for
aerobic fitness assessment, 20 points for body composition, 10 points each for
the muscular fitness assessment components, push-ups and sit-ups. Use the
following formula to determine the score: composite score = total component
points achieved multiplied by 100 and divided by total possible points.</span></p>

<p><span>18.10.3. Airmen with a
medical profile prohibiting them from performing one or more components of the
fitness assessment will have a composite score calculated on the tested
components.</span></p>

<p><span>18.10.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Exemptions.&nbsp;</b>Biannually,
members must complete a composite fitness assessment. Exemptions are designed
to categorize members as unable or unavailable to train or test, for reasons
beyond the control of the member or commander, for a limited time period as
outlined in AFI 36-2905.</span></p>

<p><span>18.10.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Component
Exemptions.</b>&nbsp;The commander, in consultation with the fitness program
manager, may grant members exemption from aerobic and muscle fitness components
based on medical recommendation according to AFI 36-2905 for a time-limited
period. Other fitness assessment components will still be assessed.</span></p>

<p><span>18.10.4.
Composite scores represent a health-based fitness level. As the fitness level
increases, Airmen are able to tolerate extremes in temperature, fatigue, and
stress while optimizing performance in the deployed environment. Refer to Table
18.1 for fitness levels.</span></p>

<p><span>18.10.5.
Members must have a current fitness score on file prior to deployment. Member
will not be considered  exempt  in the deployed location until their current
fitness assessment expires. If a member fails their fitness assessment before
deploying and their officer performance report/enlisted performance report
closes out after the deployment starts, the commander has the discretion to
annotate a non-current/failing fitness assessment within the reporting period
on the evaluation. Additionally, the commander has the discretion to document
the evaluation as a referral for a noncurrent/failing fitness assessment at the
evaluation close-out date or enlisted performance report static close out date
in accordance with AFI 36-2406,&nbsp;<i>Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.10.6.
Any failures will be annotated in Air Force fitness management system and will
be considered against the individual. However, if an Airman reaches the 91-day
mark after the unsatisfactory fitness assessment, but before the evaluation
closes out, the unsatisfactory score is no longer current and the commander has
the discretion to annotate a noncurrent/failing fitness assessment within the
reporting period on the evaluation. Additionally, the commander has the discretion
to document the evaluation as a referral for a non-current/failing fitness
assessment at the evaluation close-out date or enlisted performance report
static close out date. For Satisfactory and Excellent scores, deployed Airmen
become  exempt  only when they reach the first day of the month, seven/thirteen
calendar months following the previous official fitness assessment rating.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.11. Physical Fitness Assessment:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.11.1.
Installations will develop a local plan, signed by the installation commander,
for unit commanders to appoint physical training leaders to augment the fitness
assessment cell for the purpose of administering fitness assessments. Fitness
assessment cell augmentees will conduct fitness assessments and designated
fitness assessment cell personnel will provide oversight. Fitness assessment
cell augmentees&nbsp;<i>will not</i>&nbsp;test members from their own unit. The
fitness assessment cell will conduct the fitness assessments for all Airmen.
Where no fitness assessment cell exists, fitness assessments should be
conducted by a certified physical training leader from another unit;
arrangements of this nature will be determined by local leadership.</span></p>

<p><span>18.11.2.
The fitness screening questionnaire will be completed no earlier than 30 calendar
days (90 days for Air Reserve Component, but no later than 7 days prior to the
fitness assessment, to provide time for medical evaluation, when indicated.
Failure to complete the fitness screening questionnaire does not invalidate the
fitness assessment.</span></p>

<p><span>18.11.3.
Medical providers may recommend temporary medical exemptions for medical
conditions preventing an Airman from safely participating in specific physical
conditioning programs or in a component of the fitness assessment. Assessment
for participation in fitness activities should be made at each visit to prevent
the member from having to return for clearance or exemption at a later date.</span></p>

<p><span>18.11.4.
Pregnant Airmen will engage in physical activity to maintain cardiovascular and
muscular fitness throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period according to
medical provider recommendations. Exercise regimens will consist of routines
inclusive of physical training and nutrition counseling. Airmen are exempt from
the fitness assessment during pregnancy and for 180 days after the delivery
date.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.12. Assessment Procedures.</span></b></p>

<p><span>All
components of the fitness assessment must be completed within a 3-hour window
on the same day. If extenuating circumstances occur (for example, rapidly
changing or severe weather conditions, natural disasters, emergencies, safety
issues, etc.), then all components must be completed within 5 duty days.
Reserve members must be in a duty status for fitness assessments. The body
composition component is the first component of the fitness assessment includes
measuring height, weight, and abdominal circumference which must be the first
component assessed in the fitness assessment. The muscular fitness components
(push-ups and sit-ups) may be accomplished before or after the 1.5-mile run or
2-kilometer walk. There is a minimum 3-minute rest period between components.
The assessment components should be scheduled to allow adequate rest for
members on irregular or shift work hours.</span></p>

<p><span>18.12.1.&nbsp;<b>Body Composition Assessment:</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.12.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Height
and Weight.&nbsp;</b>Height and weight are obtained by fitness assessment cell
members.</span></p>

<p><span>18.12.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Abdominal
Circumference.&nbsp;</b>The abdominal circumference measurement is used to
obtain the body composition component score. Fitness assessment cell members,
or trained augmentees, will take the abdominal circumference measurement in a
private room or a partitioned area.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>See AFI 36-2905 for the
abdominal measurement procedures.</span></p>

<p><span>18.12.2.&nbsp;<b>Aerobic Assessment:</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
run and walk will be performed on an approved distance course. Aerobic fitness
is measured with a 1.5-mile run, according to procedures outlined in AFI
36-2905.<b>&nbsp;</b>All members will complete the 1.5-mile timed run unless
medically exempted. Members medically exempted from the run and cleared for an
alternate assessment will, upon recommendation by the exercise
physiologist/fitness program manager, complete the 2-kilometer walk, according
to procedures in AFI 36-2905.<b>&nbsp;</b>Airmen who perform the 2-kilometer
walk will not be allowed to run (that is, at least one foot must be in contact
with the ground at all times) or the fitness assessment will be terminated. The
2-kilometer walk is the only authorized alternative.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;The
member does not select the assessment method. The fitness program manager
determines which assessment to use based on the member's profile.</span></p>

<p><span>18.12.3.&nbsp;<b>Muscular Fitness Assessment:</b></span></p>

<p><span>Upper body muscular
strength and endurance are measured with a 1-minute timed push-up assessment;
abdominal muscular strength and endurance is measured with a 1-minute timed
sit-up assessment.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.13. Ongoing Education and a Supportive
Environment:</span></b></p>

<p><span>Physical fitness
education will be incorporated into training programs and unit physical
training. Ongoing commander emphasis and a supportive environment are essential
to maintain force health and fitness.</span></p>

<p><span>18.13.1.&nbsp;<b>Information and Support.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Information can be found at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/index.asp"><span>http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/index.asp</span></a><a href="http://www.afpc.af.mil/affitnessprogram/index.asp"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><span>18.13.2.&nbsp;<b>Environment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
installation environment will be conducive for all members to maintain a
healthy lifestyle, and a communitybased education and awareness program that
addresses optimal nutrition, body composition, and fitness evident to all
members. Programs will be available to Air Reserve Component personnel.</span></p>





<p><b><span>18.14. Unit Key Players.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The unit physical
training program success depends on many people, including the unit commander,
unit fitness program manager, physical training leader, immediate supervisor,
and the individual.</span></p>

<p><span>18.14.1.&nbsp;<b>Unit Commander.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
unit commander promotes, supports, and ensures unit fitness program integrity
and provides an environment that is conducive to healthy lifestyle choices;
provides an overall work environment for a community supportive of optimal
nutrition and fitness by providing access to facilities providing healthy foods
and encourages Airmen to participate in physical fitness during the duty day;
and implements and maintains a unit physical training program according to
guidelines in AFI 36-2905.</span></p>

<p><span>18.14.2.&nbsp;<b>Unit Fitness Program Manager.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
unit fitness program manager oversees the administration of the fitness program
for the unit, notifies the unit commander if members fail to attend scheduled
fitness appointments, and provides fitness metrics and unit status reports to
the unit commander monthly.</span></p>

<p><span>18.14.3.&nbsp;<b>Physical Training Leaders:</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.14.3.1.
The physical training leader completes the initial physical training leader
course before overseeing and conducting the unit fitness program and maintains
currency by receiving annual refresher course or upon change of duty station,
whichever comes first. Air Reserve Component physical training leaders at
co-located bases will receive initial and refresher training from Regular Air
Force fitness program managers. If not feasible for Air Reserve Component
physical training leaders to receive in person training, they will complete
distance learning training as coordinated through the Air Force Medical
Operations Agency and the supporting base fitness program manager.</span></p>

<p><span>18.13.3.2.
Physical training leaders must complete basic life support and automated
external defibrillator training before attending the physical training leader
certification course. They must maintain currency while serving as physical
training leaders.</span></p>

<p><span>18.14.4.&nbsp;<b>Individual.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Individuals
must maintain individual year-round physical fitness through self-directed and
unit-based fitness programs and proper nutrition standards according to AFI
36-2905. Individuals must also meet Air Force fitness minimum standards and
attend all required fitness program appointments.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18C Nutrition</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.15.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Nutrition.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Overweight and obesity in the United States has been declared a
threat to National Security. Nearly 27% of 17 to 24 year olds are too
overweight to serve in the military. The Department of Defense is not immune as
48% of Airmen are assessed as overweight and 14% obese. Imbalance of calorie intake
and physical activity are the primary causes for unintended weight gain and an
increase potential health risk. Airmen are responsible to be mission ready at
all times and must recognize that food is the fuel that supports our
performance and ability to complete the mission. To understand how nutrition
affects the body, Airmen must understand the following basic concepts:
calories, the functions of nutrients, and how to customize nutrient intake to
support performance.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span><img border="0" width="210" height="198" src="afh1_files/image249.png" ></span><span>18.15.1.<b>&nbsp;Nutrition Basics: MyPlate.&nbsp;</b>The
United States Department of Agriculture's MyPlate food guidance system (Figure
18.2) provides practical information to help individuals build healthier diets.
MyPlate emphasizes fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy groups
in appropriate portions. The United States Department of Agriculture s
website,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/"><span>www.choosemyplate.gov</span></a><a href="http://www.choosemyplate.gov/"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>has user-friendly tools and resources on topics
such as weight management and calories, physical activity, tracking your diet
and healthy eating tips.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.<b>&nbsp;Calorie Intake.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.1. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans summarizes and
synthesizes knowledge about individual nutrients and food into a set of recommendations
for</span></p>

<p><span>healthy eating. The 2015
version provides recommendations under 5 main messages; (1) Follow a healthy
eating</span></p>

<p><span>pattern
across the lifespan; (2) Focus on variety, nutrient density, and amount; (3)
Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats and reduce sodium intake;
(4) Shift to healthier food and beverage choices; (5) Support healthy eating
patterns for all.&nbsp;18.15.2.2. Maintaining a healthy weight is key to
Airmen s' health and readiness. The Air Force recognizes abdominal circumference
as one of the most specific indicators of disease risk in adults because
abdominal fat is a predictor of obesity-related diseases. In addition to
meeting military appearance standards, overweight and obese Airmen have
increased risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart disease,
stroke, Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, breathing problems and certain types of
cancer. Gradual improvements in diet, physical activity and lifestyle are
easier to incorporate and more likely to be maintained. This can be achieved by
following the key dietary guideline recommendations to consume a healthy eating
pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie
level. A healthy eating pattern includes: a variety of vegetables from all the
subgroups- dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy, and
other; fruits, especially whole fruits; grains, at least half of which are
whole grains; fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or
fortified soy beverages; a variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean
meats and poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds and soy
products; oils.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.3. Maintaining a
healthy energy balance is important. Calories from foods and beverages need to
be balanced with calories burned through metabolism and physical activity to
meet weight goals less calories to lose weight, balanced calories to maintain
weight and more calories to gain weight. If weight loss is desired, creating a
calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories a day through diet and/or exercise should
lead to a healthy weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds per week.

recommendations and assist in tracking food intake and physical activity.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Macronutrients.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Macronutrients make up
the bulk of the diet and supply energy as well as many essential nutrients.
Carbohydrates and protein provide 4 calories per gram and fats provide 9
calories per gram.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Carbohydrates.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.1.1.
Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source your body uses during exercise. An
appropriate amount of carbohydrates is important to maintain glycogen stores
for energy reserve. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels and supply energy.
Simple carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels rapidly while complex
carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels slowly over a longer time. Simple
carbohydrates are often found in packaged or processed foods, examples are;
table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, honey, fruit drinks, soft drinks and
candy. Added sugars are simple sugars added to foods or beverages when they are
processed or prepared and should account for less than 10% of calories per day.
Complex carbohydrates can be found in fruits, breads, cereals, grains, milk and
starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas, and squash). Healthy carbohydrates
contain fiber and whole grains and limited added sugars. The recommended
serving size is about the size of the palm of your hand and contains
approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate; sizes differ with sweets and
vegetables. The general recommendation for carbohydrate intake is 45-65% of
total calories.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.1.2.
Fiber is classified as soluble or insoluble. Soluble fiber attracts water and turns
to gel during digestion. Therefore, soluble fiber lowers low-density
lipoprotein/bad cholesterol and prolongs stomach emptying time so sugar is
released and absorbed more slowly. Additionally, fiber can be found in oatmeal,
oat bran, nuts and seeds, dry beans and peas, and most fruits. Insoluble fiber
adds bulk to the stool and helps food pass more quickly through the stomach and
intestines. Finally, fiber can be found in whole wheat bread, barley, brown
rice, seeds, and in most vegetables and fruits. The average American consumes
12-15 grams per day, whereas the recommended total fiber intake is 20-35 grams
per day.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Protein.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Proteins
are used by our bodies for tissue maintenance, replacement, function and growth
of our muscles. If our body is not getting enough calories from dietary sources
or tissue stores, protein may be used for energy. The general recommendation
for protein intake is 10-35% of total calories or 0.8 to 1.2 grams/kilograms
body weight to meet daily needs. Protein can be found in meats, poultry, fish,
legumes, tofu, eggs, nuts and seeds, milk and milk products, and grains.
Individuals should focus on lean meats and low fat milk products to reduce
saturated fats. The recommended serving size of meat is the size of a deck of
cards and contains about 21 grams of protein. One 8 ounce glass of milk
contains 8 grams of protein.&nbsp;</span></p>





<p><span>18.15.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Fats.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Fats
are a major energy source and help our bodies maintain temperature and protect
organs from trauma. Balanced fat intake is essential to maintain energy
reserve. Fats can be found in oils, high fat cuts of meat, baked sweets,
whole-fat milk and cream, butter, cheeses, nuts and seeds, avocados, and fish.
The general recommendation for fats is 20-35% of total calories. The
differences between the four categories of fats are important to understand;
saturated fats, trans fats, polyunsaturated fats, and monounsaturated fats.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Diets
higher in saturated fats have been linked to coronary heart disease. Saturated
fats should make up less than 10% of your daily calories, foods that contain
more saturated fats are usually solid at room temperate and can be found in
high-fat cheeses, high-fat cuts of meat, whole-fat milk and cream, butter, ice
cream, and palm and coconut oils.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.3.
Trans fats have also been linked to coronary heart disease and intake of these
fats should be kept as low as possible. They can be found in small amounts in
the fatty parts of meat and milk products and in foods that contain partially
hydrogenated oils. Trans fats can be made from vegetable oils through a process
called hydrogenation and are found in foods such as frozen pizzas, frozen pies,
cookies, and margarine, spreads and other processed foods.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.4.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>Eating
more unsaturated fan can reduce your risk for heart disease and improve
high-density lipoprotein/good cholesterol levels.<b>&nbsp;</b>Unsaturated fats
are typically liquid at room temperature and include monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats typically come from plant sources such
as canola oil, olive oil, nuts, seeds, flaxseed, and avocado but is also
present in fish such as trout, herring, and salmon.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Sodium.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Americans
consume about 3,400 milligrams of sodium every day, mostly in the form of salt
found in processed foods- canned foods, soups, cheese, bread, prepared mixes
and deli meats. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults
limit their sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day-about the amount in one teaspoon
of table salt. Certain  at-risk  groups including adults over the age of 51,
African Americans, and people who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney
disease should limit their sodium intake to about 1,500 milligrams per day.
High sodium intake raises blood pressure which is a major risk factor for the
nation's leading cause of death   heart disease. The best way to ensure a low
sodium diet is to eat whole foods such as fresh or frozen fruits and
vegetables; lean, unprocessed poultry and fish; unsalted nuts; whole grains; and
low-fat dairy products such as skim milk or yogurt.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.6.&nbsp;<b>Fluid.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Water is essential for
life, in fact the body is made up of over 60% water. Water has no calories and
is needed to transport nutrients throughout your body via blood plasma, while
also assisting many of your body's other functions, including waste
elimination. Depending on age, sex, race, and body composition water needs
differ. The exact percentage is different for males and females and from one
person to another with a range of 45-75%. Taking these factors into account,
daily water balance for each individual also depends on the total difference
between water gain and water loss. Water gains occur from consumption of
liquids, foods, and the body's natural production of water. Water losses occur
from the following sources: sweat, respiration, gastrointestinal, and renal.
The body is in constant demand for water and this demand increases when you
exercise, when you are ill, and in environmental conditions, such as humidity
and altitude. For a generally healthy individual, the Dietary Reference
Intakes, recommend a total daily water consumption (combination of drinking
water, beverages, and food) for women, 19-70 years of age, as 2.7 liters per
day and for men, 19-70 years of age, as 3.7 liters per day.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;18.15.2.7.&nbsp;<b>Caffeine.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Caffeine
is a stimulant present in a variety of products including coffee, tea, colas,
energy drinks, dietary supplements, over-the-counter medications, and some
foods. According to the Human Performance Resource Center, daily caffeine
intake up to 400 mg has been found safe for healthy adults and
non-pregnant/non-lactating women. Caffeine used in moderation with a dose of up
to 200 mg has been shown to improve cognitive performance in individuals. A cup
of coffee typically has 100 mg of caffeine. Be aware that taking large doses of
caffeine, roughly 400 500 mg, at one time can result in a serious condition
known as  caffeine intoxication.  Symptoms of caffeine intoxication can include
nausea, vomiting, agitation, nervousness, or headache. Excessive caffeine
intake can be life-threatening and could potentially cause electrolyte
imbalance or high levels of acid in the blood which could cause seizures.</span></p>





<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;18.15.2.8.&nbsp;<b>Energy
Drinks versus Sport Drinks.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Energy
drinks and sports drinks are both marketed by manufacturers to improve
performance. Evidence as to the effect of energy drinks on athletic performance
is inconsistent. Be aware, case studies have reported seizures after heavy
consumption of energy drinks. Energy drinks usually carry a  warning  due to
the use of stimulants such as caffeine, green tea extract, guarana seed
extract, yerba mate, acacia rigidula, taurine, ginseng or other proprietary
 energy boost blends.  Proprietary blends can contain novel, untested
ingredients, along with botanicals, amino acids, proteins, peptides, or
extracts. Additionally, vitamins and minerals (e.g. B-vitamins and magnesium)
may be added, leading to excessive intakes. Energy drinks are not meant to
hydrate. Sports drinks, or carbohydrateelectrolyte beverages, are designed to
hydrate and do not contain caffeine unless otherwise stated. Sports drinks
generally contain a mixture of carbohydrates (14 to 19 grams per 8-ounce
serving), sodium (115-175 mg per 8ounce serving), and potassium (20-98
milligrams per 8-ounce serving) which has been shown to improve exercise
performance. If eight liters of sweat are lost per day or higher intensity
exercise lasts greater than 60 minutes, a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage may
be needed. In conclusion, the safest solution is to avoid energy supplements
and learn more about electrolytes and carbohydrate fueling strategies to decide
which sport drink (not energy drink) is the best choice for you.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.2.9.&nbsp;<b>Alcohol.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Excessive
drinking can be harmful to your health and may increase the risk for high blood
pressure, liver cirrhosis and several forms of cancer. The Dietary Guidelines
for Americans advise limiting alcohol to one drink per day for women and two
drinks per day for men. The serving size for beer is 12 ounces, wine is 5
ounces and 80 proof distilled spirits is 1.5 ounces. The average serving of
alcohol generally has about 150 calories. Additionally, alcohol has 7 calories
per gram and can be a significant contributor caloric consumption in the diet.
Alcohol may lead to excess weight gain, increased risk for chronic diseases,
osteoporosis, stress injuries, and impaired short and long term cognitive
function.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.3.<b>&nbsp;Performance Nutrition
Basics.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Nutrition
plays an important role in maintaining health and performance, particularly
exercise. This next section builds upon the basic nutrition principles and
focuses on fueling strategies that will help enhance and optimize physical
performance. The basics of performance nutrition focus on fluid hydration and
timing of fueling strategies (before, during, and after
exercise).&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;18.15.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Fluid
Requirements with Exercise.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Exercise
substantially increases fluid loss, placing greater demands on fluid replacement;
so that proper hydration before, during, and after intense workouts is
critical. Decrements in performance starts to occur with fluid losses of 2% of
body weight degrades both cognitive and mental performance. One liter of water
is equivalent to 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. An example would be a
150 pound individual losing 3 pounds of body weight through sweat losses which
would equate to 1.36 liters of fluid. During exercise, sweat rate losses can
vary from 0.3-2.4 liters. Fluid losses are dependent on exercise intensity,
genetic predisposition, fitness status, acclimation of heat, altitude,
clothing, and other environmental conditions. Dehydration occurs with fluid
losses of greater than 2% of body weight and increases risk for heat illness,
exhaustion and stroke. In general, for activities less than 60 minutes, water
is the best beverage for hydration. If you are doing more than 60 minutes of
continuous exercise, then you may benefit from a sports drink to replace
electrolytes and carbohydrates. Also know that a while dehydration can affect
performance and be life threatening, the same can occur on the opposite end of
the spectrum with excess fluid consumption. Excess fluid can lead to
over-hydration resulting in symptoms such as chills, vomiting, dizziness,
disorientation, altered mental status, fatigue, headache, and even death.
According to the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental
Medicine, regardless of how hot it is or how hard you are working, you should
limit fluids to no more than 6 cups an hour and 48 cups a day. The key with
fluid intake is to aim to replace losses and monitor signs and symptoms of
under/over hydration. Determine how much water is lost by taking a weight
measurement (without clothes/gear) before and after a hard training workout.
Drink 16 ounces of fluid for every pound of weight lost.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;18.15.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Pre-,
During, and Post-event Eating Strategies.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Following appropriate
eating strategies based on event timing and exercise intensity can help improve
performance.&nbsp;Avoid drastic changes in diet before a fitness test or
mission; try out new foods and strategies during training times.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.3.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Pre-exercise:&nbsp;</b>The
purpose of a pre-exercise beverage, snack or meal is to provide enough fluid to
maintain hydration and enough carbohydrates to maintain proper blood sugar
levels during activity. A pre-exercise meal (includes some carbs, protein and
low or moderate fat) should be consumed 3 to 4 hours before starting the
activity. This allows time for the body to digest the food. A small amount of
protein before exercise may reduce muscle soreness later. Pre-exercise
snacks/beverages should be consumed 30 to 60 minutes before an activity. The
snacks and beverages consumed one hour before should contain mainly
carbohydrates since they are digested quickly and turned to energy-giving
glucose. Snack examples are bananas or other fruits (grapes, applesauce, and
peaches), graham crackers, pretzels, or low fiber dry cereal. Avoid foods with fat
and fiber in a pre-exercise snack to minimize possibility of an upset stomach.</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.3.2.2.&nbsp;<b>During
Exercise:&nbsp;</b>During exercise duration of less than 45 minutes,
carbohydrate consumption is not warranted. In sustained high intensity exercise
with a duration of 45-75 minutes, small amounts of carbohydrates during
activity (sports drinks and products) may enhance performance, but does not
provide a source of fuel. During endurance exercise of 1-2.5 hours in length,
carbohydrate intake provides a source of fuel. The recommended intake of
carbohydrates for events 1-2.5 hours in length is 30-60 grams per hour. In
ultra-endurance events, greater than 2.5-3 hours in length, carbohydrate
intakes of up to 90 grams per hour can improve performance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.15.3.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Post-exercise/Recovery:&nbsp;</b>If
exercising at a low or moderate intensity for less than a half hour a post
workout beverage or snack is not necessary. However, if the exercise routine is
rigorous and lasts for more than 45 minutes, a snack or light meal will help in
recovery. This  recovery  meal helps replenish the carbohydrates burned during
exercise and converts them into a storage form (glycogen) for later use. Adding
protein to the meal or snack helps rebuild muscle tears that occur during
exercise. Following exhaustive exercise a minimum of 24 hours is required to
replace the glycogen stores lost in training. Timing and the ratio of
carbohydrate to protein are also important factors to consider. The critical
window of refueling is within 45 minutes of finishing your exercise. High
glycemic foods are the most effective for restoring glycogen. An optimal
composition of a post recovery beverage or snack is a 4:1 carbohydrate to
protein ratio. This means that for every 4 grams of carbohydrates there should
be 1 gram of protein. A great example is the recovery beverage chocolate milk.
A regular 8 ounce glass of chocolate milk contains about 29 grams of
carbohydrates and 8 grams of protein, a 3.6:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. In
contrast, a regular 8 ounce glass of milk contains 12 grams of carbohydrates
and 8 grams of protein, a 1.5:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. Other examples of
simple post-workout snacks include low fat yogurt, trail mix (cereal, nuts and
dried fruit) and water, or string cheese and a fruit bar with water. Hydration
repletion should also be a priority. Recovery fluids should include sodium and
potassium. Examples of these types of fluids are: water, juices, sports
beverages, coffee, tea, soups, and water containing foods such as fruits and
vegetables.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;18.15.3.3.<b>&nbsp;Supplements.</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.15.3.3.1.
The use of dietary supplements continues to be popular among members of the
military. The term dietary supplement includes many products, such as vitamins,
minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, or other substances, and are sold as
pills, powders, bars, packs, gels, drinks, or shakes. The Food and Drug
Administration does not test products before they are sold in stores or via the
internet; this lack of oversight means there is no guarantee that what you
purchase is what you get. Knowing the  red flags' when choosing a dietary
supplement is important. First, be aware that the most popular types of
supplements- bodybuilding, performance enhancement, sexual enhancement, and
weight loss products, are the ones most likely to be  tainted  with
prescription drugs, heavy metals, or other undeclared ingredients. Second,
avoid products that have ingredients listed as  blends,   proprietary blends, 
or  delivery systems' on the label. These blends do not specify the amount of
each ingredient in the blend and increase the risk of overdosing on ingredients
such as creatine or caffeine. Third, be wary of products that promise a  quick
fix  or amazing results that seem too good to be true. Fortunately, there are
third party verification/certification companies that will test the purity
and/or quality of the product, so look for those types of labels on your
products (Figure 18.3). Remember, climate and stress may alter the effects of
dietary supplements, especially in a deployed environment which can increase
the risk of having a bad reaction to a product.</span></p>

Use/Misuse</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.16. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment and Drug Demand Reduction Programs:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.16.1.
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment and Drug Demand Reduction
programs include substance use/misuse prevention, education, treatment, and
urinalysis testing. Substance use/misuse prevention and treatment policies and
programs are thoroughly integrated into every facet of Air Force core values,
quality of life, and force management. These policies have been in place for
over two decades and have evolved to meet changing conditions within the Air
Force. Our members are held to the highest standards of discipline and
behavior, both on and off duty. Individuals who experience problems related to
substance use/misuse will receive counseling and treatment as needed; however, all
Air Force members are held accountable for unacceptable behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>18.16.2.
The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program objectives are to
promote readiness, health, and wellness through the prevention and treatment of
substance misuse and abuse; minimize the negative consequences of substance
misuse and abuse to the individual, family, and organization; provide
comprehensive education and treatment to individuals who experience problems
attributed to substance misuse or abuse, to restore function and return
identified substance abusers to unrestricted duty status or assist them in
their transition to civilian life.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.17. Policy on Drug Abuse:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.17.1.
Department of Defense policy is to prevent and eliminate drug and alcohol abuse
and dependence from the Department of Defense. Such abuse and dependence are
incompatible with readiness, the maintenance of high standards of performance,
and military discipline. Drug abuse is defined as the illegal, wrongful, or
improper use, possession, sale, transfer, or introduction onto a military
installation of any drug defined in AFI 90-507<i>, Military Drug Demand
Reduction Program.&nbsp;</i> Wrongful  means without legal justification or
excuse.</span></p>

<p><span>18.17.2.
Studies have shown that products made with hemp seed and hemp seed oil may
contain varying levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, an active ingredient of
marijuana which is detectable under the Air Force Drug Testing Program. To
ensure military readiness, the ingestion of products containing or products
derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is prohibited. Failure by military
personnel to comply with the prohibition on the ingestion of products
containing or products derived from hemp seed or hemp seed oil is a violation
of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><span>18.17.3.
To ensure military readiness, safeguard the health and wellness of the force,
and to maintain good order and discipline in the Service, the knowing use of
any intoxicating substance, other than the lawful use of alcohol or nicotine
products, that is inhaled, injected, consumed, or introduced into the body in
any manner to alter mood or function, is prohibited. These substances include,
but are not limited to, controlled substance analogues (for example, designer
drugs such as  spice  that are not otherwise controlled substances); inhalants,
propellants, solvents, household chemicals, and other substances used for
 huffing;  prescription or over-the-counter medications when used in a manner
contrary to their intended medical purpose or in excess of the prescribed
dosage; and naturally occurring intoxicating substances (for example, Salvia
divinorum). The possession of any intoxicating substance described in this
paragraph, if done with the intent to use in a manner that would alter mood or
function, is prohibited. Failure by military personnel to comply with the
prohibitions contained in this paragraph is a violation of Article 92, Uniform
Code of Military Justice.</span></p>

<p><span>18.17.4. All patients
diagnosed with a substance use disorder and entered into the Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program will be recommended for limited duty,
indicating the patient is not worldwide qualified.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.18. Policy on Alcohol Abuse.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air
Force policy recognizes that alcohol abuse negatively affects public behavior,
duty performance, and/or physical and mental health. The Air Force provides
comprehensive clinical assistance to eligible beneficiaries seeking help for an
alcohol problem.</span></p>

<p><span>18.18.1.&nbsp;<b>Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Prevention and Treatment Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>AFI
44-121,&nbsp;<i>Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program</i>&nbsp;provides
guidance for the identification, treatment, and management of personnel with
substance use problems and describes Air Force policy regarding alcohol and
drug abuse.</span></p>

<p><span>18.18.2.&nbsp;<b>Drunk Driving.</b></span></p>

<p><span>AFMAN
31-116,&nbsp;<i>Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>applies
to everyone with military installation driving privileges. AFMAN 31-116
establishes guidance on court hearing procedures, convictions, non-judicial
punishment, civilian administrative action, or appropriate punishment for
violation of impaired and intoxicated driving policies. If a member has a blood
alcohol percentage of 0.05 but less than 0.10, the person is presumed to be
impaired. Intoxicated driving is operating a motor vehicle under intoxication
caused by alcohol or drugs. There is a 1-year driving privilege suspension for
driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle while under the
influence of intoxicating liquor 0.10 percent or greater.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;In
the United States, if a state uses a more stringent standard (for example, 0.08
instead of 0.10), Air Force units will use the lower standard. Overseas, the
limit is 0.10 unless the Secretary of Defense sets a lower limit.</span></p>





<p><b><span>18.19. Identification and Referral:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.19.1.&nbsp;<b>Recognizing and Referring
Personnel for Substance Use and Abuse:</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.19.1.1.
Each person is responsible for exercising good judgment in the use of alcohol
when not otherwise restricted by public law or military directive. The Air
Force reviews members' drinking habits that affect public behavior, duty
performance, or physical and mental health. The Air Force provides non-punitive
assistance to members seeking help for an alcohol problem. In assessing
potential drug- and alcohol-related problems, the supervisory role is to identify
subordinates with problems early and to motivate them to seek and accept help.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.1.2.
As depicted in Figure 18.4, many signs and symptoms of substance use/misuse
exist. However, the presence of these signs, though common indicators of
substance use/misuse, does not always substantiate a substance use problem. To
note all the behavioral symptoms that may suggest substance use/abuse or
precisely define their sequence and severity is impossible. They are exactly as
stated signs and symptoms. Do not use these signs to make a conclusive
substance use diagnosis. This responsibility lies with the Alcohol and Drug
Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program personnel. If any of these signs are
present, it may suggest a potential problem exists for the member. Talk with
the member and explain why you are concerned. Fear of discussing concerns is
normal, but discussing the concern is important to address the concern early
before the problem gets out of control. Document and discuss specific instances
of unusual behavior with the supervisor, first sergeant, or unit commander.
This will help expedite the care a subordinate may need. When additional
professional assistance is needed, do not hesitate to document and then refer
troubled subordinates to the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment
Program.&nbsp;<b>Note:<i>&nbsp;</i></b>Help must be offered to every
individual. Any time a person acknowledges a substance use problem, notify the
supervisor, first sergeant, or unit commander.</span></p>

the Air Force to have an effective substance use prevention and treatment
program, there must be a means of identifying service members experiencing
problems with substance use. Although commanders play a major role in
identifying substance abusers, members should be aware of how commanders must
proceed in various circumstances. Due to the nature of the position
noncommissioned officers hold within the unit, they also play an important part
in the identification process. There are basically five identification methods:</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Medical
Care Referrals.&nbsp;</b>Medical personnel must notify the unit commander and
the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment program manager when a
member:</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.1.1. Is
observed, identified, or suspected to be under the influence of drugs or
alcohol while seeking medical care.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.1.2. Receives
treatment for an injury or illness that may be the result of substance
use/misuse.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.1.3. Is
suspected of abusing substances.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.1.4. Is admitted
as a patient for alcohol or drug detoxification.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Commander s
Identification.</b>&nbsp;Unit commanders will refer all service members for
assessment when substance use or misuse is suspected to be a contributing
factor in any misconduct; for example, driving under the influence, public
intoxication, drunk and disorderly, spouse or child abuse and maltreatment,
underage drinking, positive drug test, or when notified by medical personnel.
When commanders or supervisors fail to refer a member with suspected or
identified substance use problems, this places the member at increased risk for
developing more severe substance use problems and may jeopardize the safety of
others and ultimately mission accomplishment.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Drug
Testing.&nbsp;</b>The Air Force conducts drug testing of personnel according to
AFI 90-507,&nbsp;<i>Military Drug Demand Reduction Program</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i>Drug
testing is most effective as a deterrent. Therefore, Air Force military members
are subject to testing regardless of grade, status, or position. Inspection
testing is the best deterrent presently available against drug abuse. Military
members may receive an order or voluntarily consent to provide urine samples at
any time. Military members who fail to comply with an order to provide a urine
sample are subject to punitive action under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice. Commander-directed testing should only be used as a last resort
because the results cannot be used in actions under the Uniform Code of
Military Justice,&nbsp;or&nbsp;administrative actions, including adverse characterization
of administrative discharges such as (General) or under other than honorable
conditions.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Inspection
under Military Rule of Evidence 313.&nbsp;</b>Inspection testing is the most
common method of testing in the Air Force. Drug testing is random and unpredictable.
In general, an inspection is an examination conducted as an incident of
command, the primary purpose of which is to determine and ensure the security,
military fitness, or good order and discipline of the unit, organization, or
installation. Individuals are selected at random using a nonbiased selection
process. Commanders may also select work sections, units, or segments of the
military population to provide urine samples. Commanders may use the positive
result of a urine sample to refer a member for a substance use evaluation, as
evidence to support disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military
Justice or administrative discharge action, and as a consideration on the issue
of characterization of discharge in administrative discharges.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Probable
Cause.&nbsp;</b>Probable cause<b>&nbsp;</b>requires a search and seizure
authorization from the appropriate commander to seize a urine specimen.
Probable cause exists when there is a reasonable belief that drugs will be
found in the system of the member to be tested. Consult with the staff judge
advocate regarding procedures for determining whether probable cause exists.
Results may be used for Uniform Code of Military Justice or to characterize
administrative discharges.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Medical
Purposes.&nbsp;</b>Results of any examination conducted for a valid medical
purpose including emergency medical treatment, periodic physical examination,
and other such examinations necessary for diagnostic or treatment purposes may
be used to identify drug abusers. Results may be used as evidence to support
disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or
administrative discharge action according to AFI 90-507, Table 7.1. These
results may also be considered on the issue of characterization of discharge in
separation proceedings.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Self-identification.&nbsp;</b>Air
Force members with substance use problems are encouraged to seek assistance
from the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or a military
medical professional. Selfidentification is reserved for members who are not
currently under investigation or pending action because of an alcohol-related
incident. Following the assessment, the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment program manager will consult with the treatment team and determine an
appropriate clinical course of action.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Drugs.</b>&nbsp;An
Air Force member may voluntarily disclose evidence of personal drug use or
possession to the unit commander, first sergeant, substance use counselor, or a
military medical professional. Commanders will grant limited protection for Air
Force members who reveal this information with the intention of entering
treatment. Commanders may not use voluntary disclosure against a member in an
action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice or when weighing
characterization of service in a separation. Disclosure is not voluntary if the
Air Force member has previously been:</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.1.1.
Apprehended for drug involvement.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.1.2.
Placed under investigation for drug abuse. The day and time when a member is
considered placed under investigation is determined by the circumstances of
each individual case. A member is under investigation, for example, when an
entry is made in the security forces blotter, when the security forces investigator s
log shows an initial case entry, or when the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations opens a case file. Furthermore, a member is considered under
investigation when he or she has been questioned about drug use by
investigative authorities or the member's commander, or when an allegation of
drug use has been made against the member.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.1.3. Ordered
to give a urine sample as part of the drug-testing program in which the results
are still pending or have been returned as positive.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.1.4. Advised
of a recommendation for administrative separation for drug abuse.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.1.5. Entered
into treatment for drug abuse.</span></p>

<p><span>18.19.2.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Alcohol.</b>&nbsp;Commanders
must provide sufficient incentive to encourage members to seek help for
problems with alcohol without fear of negative consequences. Self-identified
members will enter the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment
assessment process and will be held to the same standards as others entering
substance use education, counseling, and treatment programs.</span></p>





<p><b><span>18.20. Leadership Responsibilities.&nbsp;</span></b><span>The supervisor's role in the treatment process
does not end with identifying and referring members. Though the supervisor is
not charged with providing treatment, daily interaction with his or her personnel
and the treatment team can have a significant impact on the success of the
treatment efforts. Identifying individuals who need treatment is a critical
first step in helping them break free of the tremendously potent cycle of
denial, negativity, and increased substance use. However, entering treatment is
only a first step. A member's substance use problem did not develop overnight
and took time, as will treatment and recovery. The supervisor must remain
focused on the member's duty performance, attendance in the program, and
maintenance of standards. One of the most critical components to a member s
treatment is the treatment team meeting. Commander and/or first sergeant and
supervisor involvement in the treatment team meeting at key points in the patient s
treatment and recovery are important. The commander or first sergeant and the
supervisor must be involved at program entry, termination, and anytime there
are significant treatment difficulties with the patient. The primary objective
of the treatment team is to guide the clinical course of the patient s
treatment after examining all the facts. The treatment team consists of the
commander, supervisor, member's counselor, medical consultants, other
appropriate helping agencies, and the member.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.21. Substance Use Assessment.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
central purpose of the substance use assessment is to determine the patient s
need for treatment and level of care required. Alcohol and Drug Abuse
Prevention and Treatment staff members conduct the substance use assessment within
seven calendar days of notification. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment program managers conduct required reviews of the patient's medical
records and all documentation provided by the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention
and Treatment staff on a priority basis. Information gathered during the
assessment will form the basis for patient diagnosis, treatment planning, and
delivery of substance use services.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.22. Substance Use Treatment.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Substance use treatment
is divided into two services: nonclinical and clinical.</span></p>

<p><span>18.22.1.&nbsp;<b>Nonclinical Services.</b></span></p>

<p><span>All
active duty members involved in alcohol-related misconduct will be referred for
a substance use assessment. Members who do not meet diagnostic criteria for a
substance use disorder will receive alcohol counseling targeted (secondary)
prevention and education. All decisions about length and number of visits of
targeted prevention and education will be based on thorough assessment and
determination of risk and is tailored for the individual. There will be at
least two follow-up appointments of a minimum of 30 minutes duration to
reassess risk, assess progress, and as appropriate, conduct a follow-up review
of the educational components. If the client is assessed to need more services,
there should be follow-ups with progress updates depending on the client s
needs. The focus of these appointments is not treatment. They are designed to
be targeted (individual) prevention, education, and reassessment. In addition
to the initial assessment, a required alcohol education module will be
completed within 2 weeks following the assessment. The alcohol education module
includes information on Air Force policy, understanding the relationship
between consumption, metabolism and intoxication, and physiological effects of
alcohol on brain and body.</span></p>

<p><span>18.22.1.1. Additional
counseling addressing bio-psychosocial issues identified in the assessment may
be prescribed. Length of involvement will be determined based on the patient s
presenting problems and agreed-upon treatment or behavioral contract.</span></p>

<p><span>18.22.1.2. Individuals being processed for
separation are provided appropriate medical care&nbsp;(e.g.,
detoxification)&nbsp;before separation. Separation action is not postponed
because of a member's participation in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention
and Treatment Program.</span></p>

<p><span>18.22.2.&nbsp;<b>Clinical Services:</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.22.2.1.
Patients meeting the Diagnostic Statistical Manual 5 diagnostic criteria for a
substance use disorder will be entered into substance use treatment with the
level and intensity of care determined by the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention
and Treatment program manager using current American Society of Addiction
Medicine criteria. The philosophy is to place personnel with substance use
problems in the least intensive or restrictive treatment environment possible
appropriate to their therapeutic needs.</span></p>

<p><span>18.22.2.2.
Depending on the member's needs, variable lengths of stay or duration of
treatment are provided within an array of treatment settings. The treatment
program will reflect a multidisciplinary approach to assist the patient to
achieve full recovery, free of the negative effect of the substance use.
Treatment plans are individually tailored to meet patient's needs. Family
involvement is strongly encouraged.</span></p>

<p><span>18.22.2.3.
Individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder<i>&nbsp;</i>will refrain
from the use of alcohol during the initial phase of treatment and are strongly
encouraged to continue to abstain during aftercare. Total abstinence is a
critical treatment goal; however, because of the nature of alcoholism, relapses
into drinking behavior are not uncommon and should be anticipated. A relapse by
itself is not sufficient reason for program failure; however, relapses must be
considered a significant threat to the patient's treatment and dealt with
appropriately.</span></p>

<p><span>18.22.2.4. Involvement
in self-help recovery groups (such as 12-step, rational recovery) is encouraged
as an adjunct to treatment. The frequency of attendance is determined by the
treatment team with the patient.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.23. Detoxification Prior to Treatment.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Patients
being referred for inpatient treatment will be assessed to determine the level
of detoxification services required. To the greatest extent possible, patient
detoxification will be managed on an outpatient basis prior to inpatient
treatment. Patients assessed as requiring medically managed detoxification
(inpatient) will be entered into an appropriate medical facility.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.24. Completing the Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.24.1.&nbsp;<b>Successful Completion.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Patients
will not be considered to have successfully completed treatment until they meet
the Diagnostic Statistical Manual criteria for early full remission. Based on
Diagnostic Statistical Manual criteria, the treatment team determines patient
progress toward agreed-upon goals and issues as stated in the treatment plan
and determines when the patient is effectively in recovery and no longer
requires program resources.</span></p>

<p><span>18.24.2.&nbsp;<b>Failing the Program:</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.24.2.1.
The treatment team determines a patient to have failed the program based on a
demonstrated pattern of unacceptable behavior, inability, or unwillingness to
comply with their treatment plan, or involvement in alcohol or drug-related
incidents after receiving initial treatment. The determination a patient has
failed treatment is based on the patient's repeated failure to meet and
maintain Air Force standards (behavior), rather than solely on the use of
alcohol. An individual who has failed the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Program will be considered for administrative separation by his or
her commander.</span></p>

<p><span>18.24.2.2.
Decisions regarding aftercare services will be based on a current assessment of
status and will include establishment of an aftercare treatment plan
identifying specific goals, interventions, and means to assess interventions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.25. Management of Personnel with Substance
use Disorders.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
commander is responsible for all personnel and administrative actions
pertaining to patients involved in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and
Treatment Program, to include assignment availability, promotion eligibility,
reenlistment eligibility, Personnel Reliability Program, security clearance,
etc. Application of administrative restrictions should be based on the
establishment of an unfavorable information file or control roster resulting
from the member's unacceptable behavior and not solely based on their
involvement in the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Program.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.26. The Line of Duty Determination.</span></b></p>

<p><span>A
member's substance use misconduct can lead to a line of duty determination. A
line of duty determination is a finding made after an investigation into the
circumstances of a member's illness, injury, disease, or death. The finding
concludes: (1) whether or not the illness; injury, or disease existed prior to service
and if an existed prior to service condition was aggravated by military
service; (2) whether or not the illness, injury, disease, or death occurred
while the member was absent from duty; and (3) whether or not the illness,
injury, disease, or death was due to the member's own misconduct. The line of
duty determination protects the interests of both the member and the United
States Government. A line of duty determination may impact disability
retirement and severance pay, forfeiture of pay, period of enlistment, as well
as veteran benefits. Additional guidance may be found in AFI 36-2910,&nbsp;<i>Line
of Duty (Misconduct) Determination.</i></span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18E Tobacco Use</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.27. Air Force Goal for Tobacco Use.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force's goal is a tobacco-free force.
Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease and death in the
United States. Every year, in the United States, tobacco use is responsible for
about 1 in 5 deaths (at least 480,000 deaths per year, of which an estimated
41,000 of these deaths are from secondhand smoke exposure).</span></p>





<p><b><span>18.28. Effects of Tobacco Use:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.28.1. Optimal health
and total fitness are force multipliers and critical to the military mission.
Tobacco use, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, spit tobacco
(also known as smokeless tobacco or  chew ), and electronic cigarettes
(e-cigarettes), is inconsistent with the Air Force's goal of a mission-ready,
healthy and fit force. Tobacco use affects all bodily systems, not just the
mouth and lungs. Some types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and many types
of other diseases, have been linked to tobacco use. For the military member,
tobacco use decreases endurance, night vision and fine motor coordination (for
example, the coordination needed to hold a weapon steady), increases the risk
of injuries (such as fractures) and post-operative respiratory complications,
and impairs (or slows) wound healing. Additionally, the Environmental
Protection Agency classifies tobacco smoke as a class  A  carcinogen. This
means smoking causes cancer. Smoking is an obvious cancer threat to the smoker;
but, more importantly, it poses a cancer threat to the individual who chooses
not to smoke. Tobacco not only harms the user but can also cause cancer or
contribute to cardiovascular disease in those who breathe the exhaled smoke
called environmental tobacco smoke.</span></p>

<p><span>18.28.2.
While studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
National Institutes of Health have shown a decline in cigarette smoking, the
use of other forms of tobacco has significantly increased. The increased use of
smokeless tobacco is based on the faulty assumption of less hazardous.
Smokeless tobacco actually contains 28 different cancercausing agents
(carcinogens). Oral cancers affect 30,000 people annually, and one person dies
every hour as a result of this disease. The 5-year survival rate is very low.
Only 50 percent of persons are alive at 5 years after diagnosis.</span></p>

<p><span>18.28.3. Nicotine found
in tobacco products is addictive. Nearly one-half of all smokers in the United
States have tried to quit in the past year. Because of the powerful physical
and psychological addiction, quitting can be a challenge. The longer one uses
tobacco, the more difficult cessation can be. Therefore, never using products
containing nicotine is the best prevention. The United States Surgeon General
has found that nearly 100 percent of adults who smoke every day started smoking
when they were 26 years of age or younger, reinforcing prevention in our
younger Airmen is critical to reducing tobacco prevalence in the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.29. Cost of Tobacco use to the Air Force.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
significant costs associated with tobacco use are both physical and financial.
TRICARE has estimated that tobacco use costs the Department of Defense $1.7
billion annually because of increased healthcare utilization and decreased work
productivity (due to smoking breaks and illness). No less significant is the
fact that the cost of smoking a pack a day for a year is 1-month's base pay for
an Airman Basic.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.30. Air Force Standards.</span></b></p>

<p><span>AFI
40-102,&nbsp;<i>Tobacco Use in the Air Force</i>, expands tobacco-free
environments. Tobacco use on a military installation is restricted to
designated tobacco areas. Tobacco use is prohibited on military treatment
facility campuses; within 50 feet of a building entry, sidewalk, or parking
lot; within 100 feet of a playground; on all recreational facilities, including
athletic complexes, golf courses, and beaches; in all lodging rooms, lodging
and unaccompanied housing common areas, and temporary lodging facility units;
and family housing if serviced by a common air-handling unit. Installation
commanders are authorized to designate all unaccompanied housing as nonsmoking.
The Air Force prohibits all students in technical training, accession, and
graduate medical education programs from using tobacco products while in duty
uniform, and prohibits tobacco use at all times during basic military training.
Not using tobacco should be the Air Force norm to promote mission readiness,
health, and productivity. Commanders are expected to support Airmen trying to
quit tobacco products. Installation health promotion programs provide
strategies for education, motivation, and intervention to discourage tobacco
use. Formal, structured tobacco cessation programs designed to assist members
in breaking the addiction to tobacco products are available.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18F Medical Care</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.31. The Military Health System:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.31.1.
The military health system is a national leader in health care, health
education, training, research, and technology. The military health system
mission, vision, and overall strategy focus Department of Defense resources on
providing a highly ready system of health that supports our nation's military
mission anytime, anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span>18.31.2.
The military health system supports the operational mission by fostering,
protecting, sustaining, and restoring health. The military health system
provides the direction, resources, health care providers, and other means
necessary for promoting the health of the beneficiary population. These include
developing and promoting health awareness issues to educate customers,
discovering and resolving environmentally based health threats, providing
health services (including preventive care, problem intervention services, and
pastoral care and religious support), and improving the means and methods for
maintaining the health of the beneficiary population by constantly evaluating
the performance of the health support. The military health system supports all
uniformed service personnel, retirees, and their families.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.32. The Defense Health Agency:</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Defense Health Agency is a joint Combat Support Agency that supports the
military medical services and manages the execution of health policy issued by
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. The Defense Health
Agency supports the delivery of integrated, affordable, and high-quality health
services to military health system beneficiaries. In addition, the Defense
Health Agency executes responsibility for shared services, functions, and
activities of the military health system and other common clinical and business
processes in support of the military services. The Defense Health Agency
additionally serves as the program manager for the TRICARE health plan.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.33. The Air Force Medical Services:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.33.1. The Air Force
medical services mission is to enable medically fit forces, provide
expeditionary medics, and improve the health of all we serve to meet our
Nation's needs.</span></p>

<p><span>18.33.2. The Air Force
medical services vision is to ensure that our patients are the  Healthiest and
Highest Performing Segment of the United States by 2025. </span></p>

<p><span>18.33.3. The Air Force
medical services objectives are to:</span></p>

<p><span>18.33.3.1. Promote and
sustain a Healthy and Fit Force.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.33.3.2. Prevent
Illness and Injury.</span></p>

<p><span>18.33.3.3. Restore
Health.</span></p>

<p><span>18.33.3.4. Optimize
Human Performance.</span></p>

<p><span>18.33.4. The Air Force
medical service is increasingly called upon to deliver medical capabilities
throughout the range of military operations. Diverse medical missions consist
of civil-military operations, global health engagement, or humanitarian
assistance/disaster relief as part of joint or multinational operations. The
Air Force medical service provides the joint forces with several distinct
capabilities around the globe, including: health services support, en route
casualty support, and health care to eligible beneficiaries.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.34. TRICARE Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>TRICARE
is the worldwide health care program serving uniformed service members and
retirees, their family members, survivors, plus certain former spouses entitled
to TRICARE benefits. TRICARE programs are also available to Air Reserve
Component members and their families. TRICARE is a force multiplier for the
military health system that fills gaps in military health care using networks
of civilian health care professionals, facilities, pharmacies, and suppliers.
These civilian networks help enable the Department of Defense to provide
beneficiaries with access to high-quality health care services even while
uniformed medics are serving abroad in contingency operations. Comprehensive,
current information on the TRICARE program can be found at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.tricare.mil/"><span>www.tricare.mil</span></a><a href="http://www.tricare.mil/"><span>.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.35. TRICARE Regions.</span></b></p>

<p><span>TRICARE is available in
the United States and overseas locations. Each TRICARE region has a managed
care support contractor that administers and coordinates health care services
with network and non-network civilian hospitals and providers.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><b><span>18.36.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>TRICARE
Plans.&nbsp;</b>Several TRICARE health plan options are available to eligible
beneficiaries. Availability for each depends on the sponsor's military status
and residence. The three primary health care options offered to eligible
beneficiaries are TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Standard, and TRICARE Extra.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.1.&nbsp;<b>TRICARE Prime.</b></span></p>

<p><span>TRICARE
Prime is the managed care option and offers the most affordable and
comprehensive health coverage to beneficiaries. Active duty members and their
families do not pay enrollment fees, annual deductibles, or copays for care,
unless they seek care in the network without a primary care manager referral.
Each Prime enrollee is assigned a primary care manager who is responsible for
providing routine, non-emergency, and urgent health care. The primary care
manager is responsible for submitting referrals for specialty care and
establishing medical necessity when needed. The primary care manager also
coordinates with the regional TRICARE contractor, when necessary, to find
specialists in the network. TRICARE Prime also has time and distance standards
for urgent, routine, and specialty care to ensure beneficiaries can
conveniently access care when the care is needed. Other Prime benefits include
travel reimbursement for some specialty care, and a point-of-service option
that permits enrollees to seek care from any provider without a referral;
however, the point-of-service option carries significantly higher deductibles
and cost shares then those under TRICARE Standard. TRICARE Prime is the only
health plan option available to active duty service members.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.1.1.&nbsp;<b>TRICARE
Prime Remote.&nbsp;</b>TRICARE Prime Remote is a stateside health plan option
for active duty service members and active duty family members who live and
work 50 miles or one-hour drive time from a medical treatment facility in a
TRICARE Prime Remote designated zip code.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.1.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Active
Duty Service Members.</b>&nbsp;Uniformed service members on extended active
duty orders who meet TRICARE Prime Remote qualifications are required to enroll
in TRICARE Prime Remote. In some cases where geographic boundaries create undue
hardship for travel, active duty service members living closer than 50 miles
may be eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.1.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Active
Duty Family Members.</b>&nbsp;Active duty family members residing with their
TRICARE Prime Remote-enrolled sponsors are eligible for TRICARE Prime Remote
for active duty family members and must enroll to enjoy the benefit. Family
members enrolled in TRICARE Prime Remote for active duty family members may
remain enrolled even if the sponsor receives unaccompanied permanent change of
station orders as long as they continue to reside in the same TRICARE Prime
Remote location.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.1.2.&nbsp;<b>TRICARE
Overseas Program Prime Remote.&nbsp;</b>TRICARE overseas program offers Prime
coverage to active duty service members permanently assigned to designated
remote locations and their eligible commandsponsored family members. Only
active duty family members who meet the Joint Travel Regulation definition of
command sponsored are eligible for TRICARE overseas program Prime Remote enrollment.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.2.&nbsp;<b>TRICARE Standard and Extra and
TRICARE Overseas Program Standard.</b></span></p>

<p><span>TRICARE
Standard and Extra are fee-for-service plans available to eligible non-active
duty beneficiaries throughout the United States. TRICARE Standard is the
stateside program and TRICARE Overseas Program Standard is the overseas
program. Enrollment is not required and coverage is automatic as long as the
beneficiary is eligible and registered in the Defense Eligibility and
Enrollment System. When using TRICARE Standard and Extra, the beneficiary may
visit any TRICARE-authorized provider within the network or outside the
network. Care within military medical treatment facilities is on a
space-available basis only. Referrals for health care are not needed under
these two health plans, but some services may require prior authorization. The
network status of the provider being seen determines whether the beneficiary
will be charged copays under TRICARE Standard or TRICARE Extra. When visiting a
non-network provider, the Standard option is being used and Standard copays
apply. When visiting a network provider, the Extra option is being used and the
beneficiary will pay less out of pocket as compared to non-network providers.
Additionally, when using network providers, the provider will file all medical
claims on behalf of the beneficiary and the beneficiary will not be liable for
any charges outside of the TRICARE copay and deductible.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.3.&nbsp;<b>TRICARE Reserve Select.</b></span></p>

<p><span>TRICARE
Reserve Select plan is a premium-based health plan available for purchase
worldwide and offers a TRICARE Standard-like benefit. TRICARE Reserve Select is
available for purchase by qualified members of the selected Reserve for
themselves and their eligible family members. Members must not be enrolled or eligible
to enroll in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.4.&nbsp;<b>TRICARE Young Adult.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
TRICARE Young Adult program is a premium-based health care plan available for
purchase by qualified dependents when dependents  age out  of TRICARE eligibility.
TRICARE Young Adult offers TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard coverage
worldwide. TRICARE Young Adult includes medical and pharmacy benefits, but
excludes dental coverage.</span></p>

<p><span>18.36.4.1. Young adult
dependents may generally purchase TRICARE young adult coverage when the
following criteria are met:</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18G Suicide
Prevention</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.38. Suicide Defined.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention defines suicide as death caused by self-directed
injurious behavior with an intent to die as a result of the behavior.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.39. Suicide Demographics.</span></b></p>

<p><span>In any given year,
roughly 40,000 Americans die by suicide, almost twice as many as are killed by
homicide. The military is not exempt from the problem of suicide. Suicide
remains a leading cause of concern and preventable form of death among Air
Force personnel. During the last five years (2011 - 2015) the Air Force lost
between 43- 63 Airmen per year to death by suicide. This equates to 12.9 to
20.3 suicides for every 100,000 Airmen. The Air National Guard and Air Force
Reserve components have lost an average of 25 Airmen per year. Additionally,
the Air Force has lost an average of 18 civilian employees to death by suicide
over the last five years. Within the Air Force, the most common stressors
experienced by those who die by suicide are relationship problems, legal
problems, mental health problems, financial hardship and work problems. Air
Force data shows that while all age, rank, gender and ethnic groups are
represented suicide is most common amongst young, junior enlisted Caucasian
males.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.40. Effect on the Military.</span></b></p>

<p><span>When suicides occur in
the Air Force, they may result in a number of serious consequences, which
include:</span></p>

<p><span>18.40.1. First and
foremost, a preventable loss of human life.</span></p>

<p><span>18.40.2. Second, the grief
and loss to the deceased's family, friends, co-workers, and military community.</span></p>

<p><span>18.40.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Third,
a direct impact on mission capability through loss of the deceased's skills,
experience, and productivity.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.41. Dynamics of Suicide.</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.41.1. The reasons for
considering suicide will vary from person to person. All people experience
stressors (i.e., challenges or problems) and distress (i.e., the negative
feelings associated with stressors). Research tends to identify that risk for
suicide is associated with feeling isolated/not belonging, the belief that the
individual is or will become a burden and an acquired capability both in access
to a means to die and overcoming the fear of dying. Other factors associated
with suicide are new or worsening stressors/distress combined with an inability
to problem solve/cope. The Air Force promotes and supports Airmen who resolve
their problems and challenges in healthy, safe, and constructive ways. To that
end, the Air Force has developed many resources to help Airmen and their
families resolve these problems.</span></p>

<p><span>18.48.2.
Airmen must know the importance of recognizing that anyone can become suicidal,
regardless of how well they have managed military or personal stress
previously. If an Airman experiences stressors or problems that overwhelm their
ability to cope, it may result in feeling distressed, alone, and a burden to
others. This may increase vulnerability and susceptibility to suicide.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.42. Protective Factors.</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.42.1. Protective
factors are strengths or resources which the individual possesses or practices
which enhance resilience and reduce distress. Common protective factors
include:</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.1. Sense of
belonging.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.2. Good, healthy
support from family, friends, and fellow Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.3. Effective
problem solving skills and coping strategies.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.4. Individual s
belief that he/she has control over his/her own life and actions.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.5. Willingness
to seek help early.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.6. Focus on the
future.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.7. Believe
things will get better.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.8. Lack of
access to means to hurt yourself.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.1.9.
Cultural/religious/spiritual beliefs that discourage suicide and support
self-preservation.</span></p>

<p><span>18.42.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>Demographic
factors are personal and unchangeable by the individual. They include aspects
such as gender or age. Common stressors are experiences which may increase
risk. They include experiences such as problems in a relationship or legal
problems. Risk factors are personal characteristics which reduce resilience or
increase susceptibility to illness and suicide. Risk factors include a history
of mental illness or use of substances. Warning signs are sudden and signify a
person is in distress and requires support. Warning signs include sudden
changes such as sleep difficulties or sudden discipline problems (See Figure
18.5.).</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.43. Common Problems.</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.43.1.&nbsp;<b>Legal
Problems.</b>&nbsp;Being under investigation for a suspected criminal offense
is extremely stressful. Legal problems almost always entail some type of career
impact and can be cause for administrative action by the Air Force. Military
members who face serious legal problems often worry about public disgrace, a
very real threat to their careers, their freedom, or their ability to find work
if separated from the Air Force. While criminal charges carry realistic
consequences, some individuals may begin thinking of the worst possible outcome
whether realistic or not. This increased stress (real or perceived) is why they
need more support from their command, unit, and Air Force community regardless
of the crime for which they have been investigated/charged/convicted.</span></p>

<p><span>18.43.2.&nbsp;<b>Financial
Problems.&nbsp;</b>Financial problems can be a stressor and a cause of
distress. Alert commanders often recognize this as symptomatic of a possible
broader pattern of problems or poor decision-making. Financial problems can
also be a symptom of other problems such as gambling or substance
misuse/addiction.</span></p>

<p><span>18.43.3.<b>&nbsp;Relationship
Problems.&nbsp;</b>Relationship problems are the most common stressor type
among Air Force members who have died by suicide. An abrupt loss, like a break
up in a romantic relationship is a frequently seen stressor. A healthy, happy
and supportive relationship can be an important protective factor against many
other kinds of stress. When relationships are troubled they may add to personal
stress/distress and/or make other stressors more challenging to manage.</span></p>

<p><span>18.43.4.<b>&nbsp;Work
and Administrative Problems.&nbsp;</b>Work and administrative problems (e.g.,
failure to complete tasks, poor performance or showing up to work late) have
been noted in many Air Force suicides. These work related stressors may be a
sign of other problems (e.g., alcohol or relationship problems) and/or they may
influence or increase feelings of hopelessness and isolation. Feelings of hopelessness
and isolation increase vulnerability and susceptibility to suicide. An Airman
facing administrative problems like fitness testing failures may feel his
career and future are at risk. Airmen must be able to identify and understand
the seriousness of workplace or administrative problems. Front line leaders and
fellow Airmen should understand the challenges that an Airman may be
experiencing and act to provide support.</span></p>

<p><span>18.43.5.<b>&nbsp;Mental
Health Problems.&nbsp;</b>Studies in non-military populations have tended to
show that up to 90% of individuals dying from suicide have evidence of past
mental health problems. This has led to the assumption that mental health
problems lead to suicide. While many individuals who die by suicide have a
mental health history the majority of individuals with a mental health history
will not attempt or die by suicide. Mental health problems are common among
Airmen who die by suicide. Despite the difficulty to fully quantify mental
health problems among Airmen who die by suicide, since Airmen may avoid seeking
mental health care and/or may under-report their symptoms. Most mental health
problems treated in the Air Force are not severe and many mental health visits
are related to difficulties with life stresses rather than a serious mental
illness. However, individuals with significant mental illness are at increased
risk of suicide. Therefore, Airmen with symptoms of a mental illness must
understand the importance of seeking help early and complying with their
treatment plans. Effective treatments for mental illness are available and can
reduce risk of suicide.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.44. Facts about Air Force Suicides.</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.44.1.<b>&nbsp;Planned
versus Unplanned.&nbsp;</b>Suicides may be unplanned (impulsive) or planned. In
unplanned suicides, there may be little or no warning. These may be very
difficult to predict or prevent and can be associated with excessive use of
alcohol or other substances. In planned suicides, an individual may take the
time to plan out the aspects of their death, like updating a will or checking on
life insurance. While these are normal activities for most adults to undertake,
a pattern of behavior in an Airman that indicates he is  putting his affairs in
order  may indicate consideration of suicide. There are often some indicators
in either planned or unplanned suicides that can be detected. See the list of
risk factors to identify potential changes.</span></p>

<p><span>18.44.2.&nbsp;<b>Communication
of Intent.&nbsp;</b>Not every Airman who dies by suicide will communicate their
intention to end their life. Some may make suicidal statements (e.g., stating
that others would be better off without them), or send texts, use voicemails,
social media posts or leave a note. Sometimes suicidal individuals talk about
themes of death and suicide, without referring to themselves. In other cases, the
deceased may not communicate their intent at all. The increase in the use of
electronic communications presents another medium for people to communicate
suicidal thoughts or intentions as well as new opportunities for alert Airmen
to intervene. Any suicidal remark should be taken very seriously and followed
up on. Some people are reluctant to ask a person whether they are having
thoughts of suicide because of the fear that they will give someone the idea.
Substantial research indicates that this is not the case. The opposite is true:
asking a person if they are having thoughts of suicide may prevent a suicide by
getting the person the care they need.</span></p>

<p><span>18.44.3.<b>&nbsp;Time of
Year versus Unpredictable Variability.</b>&nbsp;Statistically, suicide is a
rare occurrence. Because of the infrequent, suicide rates in small populations
(e.g. a major command) vary quite randomly. This often leads people to try to
find factors like time of year to explain rises and dips in rate. One such myth
is that suicide is more common during the holidays when people may feel more
alone and isolated. This is not true. Personal factors like the ones described
above are much more important. Vigilance must be maintained year round.</span></p>

<p><span>18.44.4.<b>&nbsp;Changes
in Behavior versus no Change in Behavior.&nbsp;</b>A common myth is that once
an Airman has made the decision to die by suicide, they may appear calm, as if
all their problems have been resolved. This may be true for some, but not all.
Airmen need to be observant for any sudden changes in behavior or attitude in
their fellow Airman. These changes should be attended to in a supportive manner
to ensure the individual is not considering suicide.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.45. Self-injurious Behavior and Suicide
Attempts.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Self-injurious
behavior (i.e., cutting, burning) is any behavior that intentionally causes
harm to the individual regardless of the severity of the injury. A suicide
attempt is any behavior whose intent is to end the individual's life,
regardless of the outcome. Any self-injury or suicide attempt should be treated
as serious as the severity of injury is not an accurate indicator of the
person's potential risk or intent. These injuries warrant immediate medical and
command attention and should be addressed and reported without delay.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.46. Every Airman's Responsibilities.</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span>In the Air Force, each
Airman has the responsibility to identify and support other Airmen (Regular Air
Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Civilians and Family Members) in
times of need. Each Airman must be aware of the following:</span></p>

<p><span>(1)
Command is available and trained to provide support to Airmen in need, or those
attempting to support their Airmen; (2) The Air Force established numerous
resources aimed at resolving problems and stressors. Airmen can access these
resources through chaplains, medical services or command leadership; (3) Airman
can access counseling through Military One Source (1-800-342-9647) as well as
Military Family Life Counselors; and (4) National resources like the Military
Crisis line (1-800-273-8233, Press 1). Early identification combined with
proactive problem solving enhances careers. Early intervention increases the
probability of success, and is most likely to save a life; similarly, this
helps maintain the balance promoted through the four domains of Comprehensive
Airmen Fitness (Social, Mental, Physical and Spiritual). There are a number of
identifiable risk factors and warning signs. These may include: (1) multiple
stressors or an intense stressor, sudden mood or behavior changes; (2) giving
away personal effects; and (3) making statements about suicide/suggesting it
would be better if the individual were not alive. Safety is increased when an
at-risk Airman has limited access to means of self-harm (e.g., firearms or
potentially dangerous medications). Command and Legal should be part of this
process. Any sudden purchase of lethal means can be a very significant warning
sign that should be questioned and reported.</span></p>

<p><span>18.46.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
people most likely to spot a person at risk for suicide are the ones who
interact with that person on a daily basis (e.g., friends, coworkers or
immediate supervisors). These individuals are best positioned to notice changes
in an atrisk Airman's behavior, mood, and performance. Engage with that person,
find out what caused the observed changes, assist in choosing resources to
resolve stressors, and communicate concerns with the chain of command as
appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span>18.46.2. Know your
resources and encourage appropriate help-seeking from installation and other
support agencies to resolve the challenges. Challenges and stressors are a
normal part of each person's life. You are encouraged to engage with fellow
Airman and know how they generally look and behave. When you notice there is a
problem, assist your fellow Airman in finding help to resolve the challenge early.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.47. Military Leadership Role in Preventing
Suicide:</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.47.1. While suicide
prevention is the ultimate responsibility of every Airman, the Air Force has
identified that leadership support and action across the levels of command are
critical to the goal of reducing suicide in the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>18.47.2.
The Air Force Suicide Prevention program is based on leadership action. Leaders
at all levels are responsible for implementing this program. Successful risk
identification rests with the Airman's most immediate associates and his or her
first-line supervisors who see and interact with them on a daily basis and are
in a position to see any changes in behavior or performance that may signal a
problem. Open communication between Airmen and their supervisors, especially in
an environment where there is genuine concern for everyone's well-being, is
vitally important.</span></p>

<p><span>18.47.3.
Frontline supervisors have tremendous and complex responsibilities in our high
ops tempo Air Force, executing the mission and taking care of their
subordinates. Effective training and strong leadership can enhance the support
that an Airman will receive. Some factors that can challenge effective
supervision are: (1) tunnel vision on the mission to the exclusion of
subordinate needs; (2) not being engaged with their Airmen; (3) difficulty
recognizing risk factors and warning signs; (4) lack of knowledge of Air Force
supported resources and the true impact of seeking help on an Air Force career;
and (5) inappropriately  protecting  the Airman from the consequences of their
actions or failing to take proper action. Some examples of inappropriate
supervisor actions are supervisors telling subordinates to avoid seeking mental
health assistance as this will hurt their career, helping subordinates hide alcohol
and drug misuse problems, promoting the avoidance of installation helping
services and possible safe and constructive resolution of problems. The
majority of the time, seeking help appropriately does not have long-term
negative career impact. In fact, seeking help can improve performance and
enable people to better solve problems. Supervisors should engage in problems
early to ensure subordinates get the help they need to maintain peak
performance.</span></p>

<p><span>18.47.4.
When risk is identified, appropriate professional resources can be obtained and
applied to the problem. The Air Force has invested in the development of
outstanding helping resources whose purpose is to support individuals in
distress, leaders in enhancing safety, promoting balance in the four domains of
Comprehensive Airmen Fitness and preventing suicide. Appropriate intervention
will vary depending on the nature of the problem and degree of risk. Sometimes
situations require services from multiple support agencies (e.g., Mental
Health, Airman &amp; Family Readiness and Chaplains, etc.). The Airman's Guide
for Assisting Personnel in Distress provides resources to help supervisors and
Airmen guide personnel to appropriate helping agencies and is available
at:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide/index.asp"><span>airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide</span></a><a href="http://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/airmansguide/index.asp"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><b><span>18.48. Actions to Mitigate Suicide Risk.</span></b></p>

<p><span>While
not every suicide can be prevented, definite steps can be taken by Air Force
personnel to reduce risk in Air Force populations. The following actions can be
taken to support Airmen in resolving life's challenges and reducing the number
of suicides: (1) Knowing your co-workers; their usual mood and behaviors, and
how they are functioning; (2) Being able to recognize early signs of risk,
stress and distress; (3) Engaging with Airmen to determine what may be
stressful or problematic; (4) Assisting Airmen with choosing the most
appropriate resource to help resolve the problem; and (5) Following up with
Airmen to ensure the stressors are resolving and new ones are not taking their
place.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.49. Psychological Services.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Mental Health Services
are designed to be a force multiplier in the Air Force. Seeking care for a
mental health problem is a sign of strength and increases the likelihood of
recovery while reducing risk for suicide. More than 12% of Air Force personnel
voluntarily seek mental health services each year.</span></p>

<p><span>18.49.1.
At the installation level, mental health clinic staff members typically perform
a risk assessment on all individuals who come in for services as well as screen
for suicide at follow up appointments. The services and treatment provided at
mental health clinics play an important role in suicide prevention, but the
healthcare system does not own the problem and can only act if aware of the
problem. This means individuals at risk must either seek help themselves or be
brought into the healthcare system by others. Suicide prevention is the
responsibility of the entire Air Force community.</span></p>

<p><span>18.49.2.
A common fear is that seeking care at the mental health clinic will have
negative impact on the person's career. A 2006 study (Rowan, A.B. &amp; Campise
R. L., 2006) reviewing more than 1,000 self-referred mental health cases found
that in 89 percent of cases there was no contact at all between the mental
health clinic and the patient's unit. In 97% of cases there was no negative
impact on career. Confidentiality is governed by AFI 44-172&nbsp;<i>Mental
Health.</i></span></p>

<p><span>18.49.3.
Mental health providers are required by DoDI 6490.08,&nbsp;<i>Command
Notification Requirements to Dispel Stigma in Providing Mental Health Care to
Service Members,</i></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to disclose safety (for example, suicidal or
violent thoughts) and fitness for duty issues to commanders, but all other
information is private. For more information on the limitations of
confidentiality see DoDI 6490.08. Willingness to seek help when needed is a
sign of good judgment and strength.</span></p>

<p><span>18.49.4.
In an effort to promote help-seeking by Airmen who are experiencing legal or
administrative problems, the Air Force instituted the Limited Privilege Suicide
Prevention Program in accordance with AFI 44-172<i>.&nbsp;</i>This program
allows Airmen who are under investigation to receive mental health care without
risk of further incriminating themselves.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.50. Air Force Suicide Prevention Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>The Air Force Suicide
Prevention Program is an evidence based approach which requires that all
personnel take an active role in reducing suicide.</span></p>

<p><span>18.50.1.<b>&nbsp;Suicide
Prevention Program's History.</b>&nbsp;In May 1996, General Thomas S. Moorman,
Air Force Vice-</span></p>

<p><span>Commander,
commissioned an integrated product team composed of all functional areas of the
Air Force. He requested General Charles H. Roadman (Air Force Surgeon General)
chair the 75-member committee and develop suicide prevention strategies. The
suicide prevention integrated product team quickly realized suicide was not a
medical problem, but instead was a community problem. To establish an effective
program, they designed a line program owned by the Chief of Staff of the Air
Force with the Air Force Surgeon General as the office of primary
responsibility. The program was founded upon the concept that decreasing
suicides required a community/Public Health approach in which prevention and
assistance were offered long before someone became suicidal.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.50.2.&nbsp;<b>Air
Force Suicide Prevention Summit</b>. In 2015, in response to a concern about
rising suicide rates, the Air Force convened a Suicide Prevention Summit,
bringing together subject matter experts from DoD, the Military Services,
federal agencies including the National Institute for Mental Health and Centers
for Disease Control and academic researchers and theorists, to address the
issue of suicide in the Air Force and move the program forward. Based on the
recommendations of the Summit, six interconnected Suicide Prevention Lines of
Effort were identified and six corresponding working groups were formed under
oversight of the Air Force Integrated Delivery System and Community Action
information Board. These Lines of Effort's included: (1) Integrate Prevention;
(2) Strengthen Airman Culture; (3) Leverage Strength-Based Communication; (4)
Enhance Civilian Support Services; (5) Targeted Resilience Outreach; and (6)
Improve Medical Care of At-risk Airmen. The 11 elements were retained as the
core of the program while a wide range of initiatives were established and
executed under the Lines of Effort framework to enhance the effectiveness of
suicide prevention.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.50.3.<b>&nbsp;Air
Force Suicide Prevention Program Elements.</b>&nbsp;In order to combat suicide,
the suicide prevention integrated product team developed and implemented 11
overlapping initiatives or elements, as published in AFI 90-505,&nbsp;<i>Suicide
Prevention Program.&nbsp;</i>These 11 initiatives are designed to foster an
Airman culture under commander-led action groups which can be grouped into
three broad categories:</span></p>

<p><span>18.50.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Leadership
and Community.</b>&nbsp;Leadership Involvement, Unit-based Preventive Services,
Airman Culture, Suicide Event Tracking and Analysis, Post Suicide Response
(Postvention), Integrated Delivery System, Community Action Information Board
and Commanders Consultation Assessment Tool.</span></p>

<p><span>18.50.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Education.</b>&nbsp;Addressing
Suicide Prevention through Professional Military Education, Guidelines for
Commanders: Use of Mental Health Services.</span></p>

<p><span>18.50.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Protections
for those under Investigation.</b>&nbsp;The Investigative Interview Policy and
Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention Program. The Investigate Interview policy
directs that following any investigative interview, the Air Force investigators
(e.g., Air Force Office of Special Investigations, Inspector General, Security
Forces, and Equal Employment Opportunity) must hand-off the accused directly to
the member's commander, or first sergeant through person-to-person documented
contact.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Limited Privilege Suicide Prevention Program</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>is available to those who are under investigation or have been
formally charged with a crime. This protection allows individuals at risk of
suicide to access mental health services with confidentiality of what is
discussed during that time that the individual is deemed to be at risk.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.51. Intervention Model.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Suicide
prevention is everyone's responsibility. For effective suicide prevention, we
need to create a culture that encourages early help-seeking behavior and
develop a community that provides assistance long before someone becomes
suicidal. The model listed below was developed to assist Airmen in intervening
when an Airman is experiencing stress, distress and challenges.</span></p>





<p><span>18.51.1.&nbsp;<b>The Ask, Care, and Escort (ACE)
Model.</b></span></p>

<p><span>To facilitate personal
engagement in suicide prevention, the Air Force has developed the acronym, ACE,
to help people remember the key steps.</span></p>

<p><span>18.51.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Ask.&nbsp;</b>When
you see or hear any of the warning signs discussed in this section, or are
aware of risk factors in someone's life, ask questions to learn more about the
person's problems or concerns. If you have any concerns about someone's safety,
calmly but directly ask the question,  Are you thinking of killing/hurting yourself? 
Asking about suicide gives people permission to talk about a subject that may
otherwise be difficult to bring up and lets the Airman know you are ready to
discuss what they are experiencing. Do not promise to keep thoughts of suicide
a secret. Airmen need to remember the importance of sharing these concerns with
command and professionals who can help the person.</span></p>

<p><span>18.51.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Care.
S</b>howing care and concern for those at risk is important. Simply taking the
time to ask about problems, and asking specifically about suicide shows caring
and concern. If someone acknowledges thoughts of suicide, listen to them and
allow them to share what is troubling them. Avoid making judgmental statements,
such as  you wouldn t do something so stupid  or immediately trying to solve
their problem or talk them out of suicide. If they have shared thoughts of
suicide with you, accept that they are in distress, listen to their concerns,
and begin the process of getting them help. You should also identify if they
have a plan for suicide, what the plan is, and attempt to remove anything that
might be used for self-harm, such as weapons or medications. First, understand
there are many potential means for self-harm and recommend you take reasonable
steps to secure the potential means of suicide while not putting yourself in
harm's way. If you are not able to secure the potential means of selfharm, or
you have significant concern about the individual's safety, then command and
emergency services need to be contacted.</span></p>

<p><span>18.51.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Escort.&nbsp;</b>After
asking about suicide and showing concern, the final step is to escort the
person to command, or a professional support agency that can provide
appropriate assistance. Do not leave him or her alone, or send the person alone
to a chaplain or mental health clinic as he or she may change his or her mind
on the way. At most bases, chaplains and mental health professionals are on
call through the command post, and evaluations can be conducted in local
emergency rooms if on-base services are not accessible. If an Airman reveals
that he or she is thinking about suicide, this is a life or death emergency and
command must be contacted. If a distressed Airman will not agree to go with
you, you should contact your chain of command or emergency services for help to
ensure the person's safety.</span></p>

<p><span>18.51.2.
Understanding the appropriate steps to suicide risk prevention and the
available Air Force approved resources can aid in saving the career and life of
a fellow Airman. Engage the Airman to understand the problem. Utilize
leadership to support safety and good decision-making. In non-crisis situations
utilize resources such as chaplain services, Military Family Life Counselors or
Military One Source. If an Airman is in crisis utilize emergency services
including Air Force, local civilian or national resources, 911, emergency room,
mental health clinic or Military Crisis Line (1-800-273-8255) to provide
professional support to an Airman in distress.</span></p>

18H Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.52. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Components.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Understanding
the difference between operational stress and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) is important. Most individuals who experience a traumatic event in an
operational environment will have some reaction and some signs of  stress' like
problems with sleep or troublesome memories; however, the majority of
individuals exposed to a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. PTSD is a
complex mental health diagnosis made by trained professionals for individuals
meeting specific diagnostic criteria. Prolonged or repeated exposures to
stressful or traumatic events increase the chance of stress reactions, and if
over looked or untreated can lead to mental health symptoms to include
recurrent and unwanted thoughts, images and dreams, exaggerated startle
response, and avoidance of situations or activities that remind the individual
of aspects of the traumatic event. PTSD also causes persistent mood symptoms,
including feelings of depression, foreshortened sense of the future, and an
inability to express the full range of emotions. This latter symptom is often
noticed by friends and family members who are more likely to notice a mood or
behavioral change in the individual with PTSD. Since the dawn of time, people
have experienced traumatic events and many have the skills and resources to
deal with them. For this reason most stress reactions resolve on their own or
with minimal assistance, especially when identified early. Therefore, the
benefit to the individual, unit and mission is to recognize and respond to
stressors and stress-related symptoms proactively when they are present in the
unit or individual. However, do not assume that simply because someone has been
exposed to trauma, they will inevitably develop PTSD. If symptoms from a
traumatic event emerge, they usually emerge within the first 30 days of the
trauma and for someone to develop delayed onset PTSD in the absence of any
initial symptoms is unusual. Some of the symptoms of PTSD you might notice in
yourself or your wingmen are listed below. Depending on many factors, like the
severity and number of exposures, for a small subset of individuals, stress
reactions do not resolve on their own, and symptoms of PTSD may develop. The
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual5 defines PTSD by eight criteria: (1) stressor
(there must be a traumatic incident the person was exposed to); (2) intrusive
symptoms (the person persistently re-experiences the event); (3) avoidance (the
person attempts to avoid reminders of the event); (4) negative alterations in
cognitions (thoughts) and mood; (5) alterations in arousal and reactivity (like
irritability, easy startle and sleep difficulties); (6) duration (persistence
of symptoms greater than one month); (7) functional significance (impact to
functional areas (e.g., social, occupational)); and (8) exclusion (disturbance
not due to medication, substance use or other illness). As with most mental
health diagnoses, other conditions must first be ruled-out before a diagnosis
of PTSD can be made. This includes the effects of medication, alcohol or a
co-existing medical condition that shares some of the symptoms of PTSD.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.53. PTSD Incidence.</span></b></p>

<p><span>New
rates of diagnosed PTSD continue to remain relatively low (under 1%) among
total force Airmen, but differ by gender and career group. Women are twice as
likely to be diagnosed with PTSD as men, and specific career fields show
elevated rates of PTSD, including special investigators, medical, and support
personnel. Deployment is a risk factor for PTSD because deployment increases
the likelihood of exposure to trauma. However, an important note is that most
people who develop PTSD experience a non-combat trauma such as interpersonal
violence which can occur in a number of different environments.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.54. Prevention.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
prevention of PTSD occurs by fostering resilient coping responses to stress.
The more psychologically capable the individual is to withstand a stressful
situation, the less likely that individual is to develop PTSD. An internal
locus of control, the belief that and commitment to life values, and a
supportive peer network are all factors that bolster the stress response and
enable Airmen to go through trauma without negative consequences. Further, the
ability to recognize stress reactions and intervene when they are present is
important in the prevention of PTSD and other mental health issues. This is
based on the theory that preparation for trauma helps to  insulate  the
individual and gain a sense of control or mastery over the environment.
Deploying Airman receive just in time training on stress reactions,
psychological first aid, and referral resources through online Pre-Deployment
mental health training (in Advanced Distributed Learning Service).
Additionally, post deployment training (currently provided by installation
mental health staff) focuses on the reintegration back into home life and work
after a deployment and how to recognize stress reactions and symptoms that can
remain or emerge following a deployment where there have been potentially
traumatic experiences. Critical to the prevention of PTSD is for leaders to
clearly communicate mission details and expectations to the extent possible so
that deploying Airmen can anticipate their deployment experiences and practice
adaptive coping responses prior to exposure to trauma. Preparation also helps
Airman evaluate the possible difficulties they may experience during deployment
and develop a plan for managing those difficulties before they occur.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.1.<b>&nbsp;Risk and Protective Factors.</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.54.1.1.
There are many factors that can make an individual more vulnerable to negative
effects of traumatic experiences and to eventually develop PTSD. Some of these
include ongoing life stresses, lack of social support, history of a psychiatric
disorder/or family history of one, and past stresses like prior combat
exposure, and even childhood history of abuse. Each individual has different
personal strengths and resilience skills that help him or her deal with
traumatic experiences. Therefore, each unit is a sum of these strengths and
each deployed unit should capitalize on these strengths. Understanding your
personal strengths and vulnerabilities and those of the others in your unit
allows you to intervene early after a traumatic event and seek out the support
needed for resolving stress reactions. Remember, risk factors or even exposure
to horrific events do not equal a diagnosis of PTSD.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.1.2.
Effective unit leadership is a critical factor in preventing PTSD. A cohesive
unit with solid leadership, clear operational goals, and frequent communication
can reduce risk. Leadership which stresses and Airmen who practice good
self-care (getting regular and adequate sleep, eating a balanced diet, and
having adequate time for rest and relaxation) along with the use of positive
stress management skills can help reduce operational stress and decrease the
risk of PTSD. Informed leaders can actively impact their units to reduce the
risk of PTSD and other related problems to their Airmen by ensuring they are
engaged and working as a team.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.2.&nbsp;<b>Operational Stress Reactions.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Operational
stress reactions can be experienced by both individuals exposed to a traumatic
event or those individuals/units with a high operational tempo where the
requirements of battle have kept them from having adequate downtime. Stress
reactions may be evident in different forms and may range from mild to severe.
Below are some of the reactions to be aware of to ensure early intervention.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.2.1. Physical
signs like rapid breathing or shortness of breath, feeling dizzy, headaches,
feeling nauseated, profuse sweating or sweaty palms, and rapid heart rate.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.2.2. Mental signs
like sleep disturbance, poor attention and concentration, poor problem solving,
confusion, hyper-vigilance, and nightmares.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.2.3. Emotional
signs like irritability and blaming others, fear or anxiety, feeling
overwhelmed, feeling guilt, denial, agitation, and feelings of sadness
(depressed mood).</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.2.4. Behavioral
signs like withdrawal, change in communication, increased alcohol consumption,
change in appetite, emotional outbursts, jumpiness or being easily startled,
and suspiciousness.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.3.&nbsp;<b>Psychological First Aid.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Psychological first aid
is designed to reduce the initial distress caused by a traumatic event and can
be used for ongoing operational stress where individuals may exhibit stress
reactions. Psychological first aid supports individuals with stress reactions
by teaching adaptive coping and recovery skills that can easily be implemented.</span></p>

<p><span>For
individuals whose stress reactions aren t resolving in a short period of time,
additional support from Mental Health or the Combat &amp; Operational Stress
Control unit should be encouraged. Tenets of psychological first aid include
the following:</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Safety.</b>&nbsp;Provide
a physically and emotionally safe place (as the operational environment allows)
for individuals to recuperate emotionally following a traumatic event. This may
be as simple as designating a tent/shelter away from the incident with food,
water and a place to relax.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Needs.</b>&nbsp;Learn
what the Airmen's needs and concerns are by listening to them with compassion
and responding with a calm voice. Are they worried about someone? Do they want
to make a phone call?</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Availability.</b>&nbsp;Make
yourself available. For example, offer to go to the gym, dining facility, play
games, morale tent, or just be there to talk/listen.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.3.4.&nbsp;<b>Support.</b>&nbsp;Encourage
Airmen to stay connected with peers and social support, this maybe in the
deployed setting or at home.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.3.5.&nbsp;<b>Coping.</b>&nbsp;Provide
basic coping skills that empower others to make decisions for one's self and
restoration back to  normal  state. Lead by example using self-care mentioned
earlier.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.3.6.&nbsp;<b>Services.</b>&nbsp;Finally,
link individual with supportive services, if needed. These include Chaplains,
first sergeants, or Mental Health.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.4.&nbsp;<b>Pre-Exposure Preparation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.54.4.1.
The goal of Pre-Exposure preparation is to enhance resilience through
anticipating and understanding normal responses to unusual stressors which
might include exposure to battle or a mass accident scene with human
casualties. Individuals are better prepared, are calmer and feel more in
control when they have some advance knowledge of what to expect on scene and
what stress reactions are normal and to be expected. Pre-Exposure preparation
focuses on preparing Airmen for a particular mission or incident by providing
relevant (and sometimes graphic) details applicable to the probable upcoming
mission or situation. In preparing Airmen for a mission, PreExposure
preparation training will educate the Airman on three key steps to support
successful performance under stress by: (1) Being aware of the individual s
functioning and changes in functioning (such as changes in their behavior,
sleep, or mood); (2) Identifying and practicing positive stress management
behaviors (such as getting proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise); and (3)
Avoiding unhelpful coping behaviors (such as excessive alcohol usage, poor
sleep or eating practices, etc). Pre-Exposure preparation should be tailored to
the unit and specific mission in order to be relevant and effective.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.4.2. Units that
have a moderate or higher chance of exposure to traumatic events as part of
their duties can enhance their psychological resilience and risk of operational
stress with the following preparation principles:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.4.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Engage
in Realistic Training.&nbsp;</b>Get Airmen ready for the tasks they will
perform in the operational environment.<b>&nbsp;</b>Train using simulated or
actual exposure to realistic events, such as body handling, survival training,
and mock captivity training, as appropriate for the unit's mission.</span></p>

<p><span>18.54.4.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Strengthen
Perceived Ability to Cope.&nbsp;</b>Feeling competent to do one's job in an
operational environment is critical.<b>&nbsp;</b>Discuss reasons for realistic
training. Enhance the individual's sense of competency by training to the point
until the Airmen feels competent and has gained a sense of mastery. If
possible, include the teaching of coping skills during operational training in
order to increase the likelihood that the Airmen will use those skills when
needed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.55. Treatment.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Today,
there are treatments available for PTSD that have been demonstrated through
rigorous scientific research to be high effective. These are referred to as
Evidence-Based Treatments. The Air Force has supported training in two
EvidenceBased Treatments by requiring training in one or more Evidence-Based
Treatments during mental health residency programs in psychiatry, psychology,
and social work. Direct accession providers receive training in Evidence-Based
Treatments during their first assignment through a collaborative arrangement
with the Center for Deployment Psychology. The two Evidence-Based Treatments
that are taught to all mental health providers in the United States Air Force
are: (a) Cognitive Processing Therapy; and (b) Prolonged Exposure. These are
among the Evidence-Based Treatments that have been recommended as first-line
treatment of PTSD by the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical
Practice Guidelines based on a detailed review of the scientific literature.
Typical treatment protocols include 10-12, weekly sessions with a trained
provider in a supportive, therapeutic environment. Most research indicates that
Evidence-Based Treatments reduces PTSD symptoms by approximately 50% and that
this improvement is sustained over several months to years. In many cases,
Airmen diagnosed with PTSD and treated with Evidence-Based Treatments will
 lose  the PTSD diagnosis and will notice that symptoms either disappear
entirely, or are sub-threshold and do not interfere with quality of life. If
properly treated, the majority of Airmen diagnosed with PTSD never require a
medical board.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18I Stress
Management</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.56. Stress Defined.</span></b></p>

<p><span>18.56.1.
At some point in your life, you have probably experienced stress. Long work
days, increased deployments, and financial issues are just a few of the things
that can make you feel stressed. The frequency of stress and the significant
negative effect stress can have on people and organizations make this a major
concern of enlisted leaders at all levels. The importance at the organizational
level is because stress can negatively affect performance, organizational
effectiveness, and mission accomplishment. On a personal level, experiencing
stress over an extended period of time can lead to health problems and affect
your overall quality of life. Therefore, the importance is to personally and
professionally recognize stress and to learn how to manage stress effectively.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.2. Stress is a
dynamic concept that dates back to earlier this century. According to Jerrold
S. Greenberg in his book&nbsp;<i>Comprehensive Stress Management</i>, the
concept of stress is based on the research of two individuals named Walter
Cannon and Hans Selye. Cannon, a physiologist at Harvard Medical School, was
the first person to describe the body's reaction to stress. He identified this
reaction as a response to a perceived threat that prepared the body for flight
or fight. Later research conducted by Selye, an endocrinologist widely regarded
as the father of stress research, concluded that the body's reaction to stress
was the same regardless of whether the source was good or bad, positive or
negative. He also provided us with a useful definition of stress. According to
Selye, stress can be defined as  the nonspecific response of the body to any
demand for change.  The demand in Selye's definition is commonly called a
stressor.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.3. A stressor can be more accurately defined as any factor (demand)
that has the potential to cause stress. This factor can be positive, such as
getting promoted, or negative, such as getting fired. The causes of stress is
from either positive or negative factors. Selye labeled the stress experienced
from positive factors eustress. Eustress results from exhilarating experiences
and is the stress of winning and achieving. He labeled the stress experienced
from negative factors distress.</span></p>

<p><span>Distress includes the
stress of losing, failing, overworking, and not coping effectively. When you
start to feel  stressed out,  distress is usually the type of stress you are
feeling.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.4. We are in daily
contact with many types of stressors. For the most part, we can categorize them
into two major areas: organizational stressors and extra-organizational
stressors.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.4.1.
Organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced in the work
environment. For Airmen today, that could range from short-notice deployments
to hazardous working conditions. Imagine how you would feel if your commander
informed you that you would deploy in a week, or how you might feel if your
work environment was bombarded with loud noises all day. If these types of
situations regularly happen to you and you have not developed effective ways to
cope with them, you could experience stress.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.4.2.
Extra-organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced outside the
work environment. Three major extra-organizational stressors are family,
marital, and financial issues. Family and marital issues can run the gamut from
minor illness to conflicting roles in the family to a death in the family.
Similarly, financial problems can run from the minor to the catastrophic. These
types of stressors are important because while they usually occur outside of
the duty section, if not properly managed, they can affect performance at work.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.5.
How do you know if you are stressed? Stress reactions appear in four different
categories: cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical. The key to
recognizing stress is to know understand what is normal for you so that you can
recognize when something has changed. The combined presence of symptoms
determines the degree of the problem.</span></p>

<p><span>Indicators (Figure 18.6)
may be isolated reactions or combinations among the four categories. Finally,
the duration, frequency, and intensity of the symptoms could make dealing with
stress difficult.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.6.
Being able to recognize the symptoms of stress is important, not only for
yourself, but for your Airmen, as well. The earlier you identify what stress
does to your body and state of mind, the earlier you can employ stress
reduction techniques.</span></p>

<p><span>18.56.7. Stress
management programs and methods vary, but they all tend to have common goals.
Individual stress management methods aim at strengthening your ability to
manage stressors and the stress response. Organizational stress management
methods aim more at altering potential stressors themselves. Because
organizational and extra-organizational stressors are interrelated and
influence each other, attention to both stress management methods is vitally
important.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.57.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Individual Stress Management Methods:</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.57.1.&nbsp;<b>Planning.</b></span></p>

<p><span>You
can reduce stress by identifying potential stressors before they cause
problems. Once you identify stressors, you can develop strategies to avoid
their effects while achieving your goals. For example, if you are stressed by crowds
and long lines, don t plan to visit the commissary on or just after payday. If
you get extremely upset when you are recalled in the middle of the night,
having the latest recall roster and procedures readily available at all times
may help reduce the amount of stress you feel. While planning can t prevent
stress that occurs as an event is happening, planning is extremely valuable in
preventing stress before a stressor occurs.</span></p>

<p><span>18.57.2.&nbsp;<b>Time Management.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Not having enough time to complete a task can be
a significant stressor for some people. If time management is an issue for you,
you can reduce stress by using effective time management skills and tools, like
developing a task list and prioritizing tasks.</span></p>

<p><span>18.57.3.&nbsp;<b>Overload Avoidance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>For
most people to eliminate, or at least reduce, the effects of overload-related
stressors is relatively simple. For a start, identify and avoid busy work,
delegate or empower others when possible, learn to say no, and attempt to
negotiate unreasonable deadlines.</span></p>

<p><span>18.57.4.&nbsp;<b>Relaxation.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Relaxation
can help you manage stress and stay alert, energetic, and productive. When you
relax, you reduce mind and body tension. By incorporating relaxation skills
into your daily routines, you can train your body to respond differently to
stress. Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, reading, and listening to
music, can improve your heart rate, regulate your blood pressure, and decrease
your respiratory rate. If you are experiencing stress in your life, taking the
time to relax can reduce the negative effects of stress on your health.</span></p>

<p><span>18.57.5.&nbsp;<b>Exercise and Good Nutrition.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Regular
exercise combined with a healthy diet is an effective stress management
technique. Exercise can provide an outlet for excess energy and tension caused
by stress. Eating nutritious foods ensures your body has the nutrients needed
to manage stress, and helps prevent overeating. Exercising and eating a
balanced diet help your body become more resistant to the negative results of
stress, such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and frequent illness.</span></p>

<p><span>18.57.6.&nbsp;<b>Strong Social Support Networks.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Having a strong social
support network such as family, friends, social clubs, peers etc. can help you
manage stress.&nbsp;Being able to discuss your problems with people who
care about you and your wellbeing can help reduce your stress by giving you a
more positive outlook, suggest solutions to your problems, or just listen. Just
talking about your problems and letting them out can help release any built-up
tension and may make you see the situation or problem more clearly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.58.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Organizational
Stress Management Methods.</b>&nbsp;As an Airman or a supervisor, your approach
to dealing with stress can help reduce your and your subordinates' stress
levels. You can begin by identifying potential stressors in the work
environment and developing strategies to remove or reduce them. Here are a few
examples of organizational stress management methods you can use:</span></p>

<p><span>18.58.1.&nbsp;<b>Job Design.</b></span></p>

<p><span>If
you identify potential sources of stress associated with tasks, ask yourself if
there is a need for each task and if the task is feasible. Eliminate the task
if not needed. If the task is feasible, ask yourself how important job design
is and prioritize. If your job requires you and/or your subordinates to work
long hours, consider using elements of job enrichment, like giving adequate
time off or periodic breaks to help reduce potential stress. If within your
power restructure the job to better accommodate individual needs and the
abilities of your Airmen to help reduce stress and enhance productivity.</span></p>

<p><span>18.58.2.&nbsp;<b>Improving the Work Environment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Numerous
physical factors within a work environment can be potential stressors. Some of
these stressors cannot be eliminated, but you may be able to reduce them.
Examine such environmental factors as temperature, noise, light levels, and
make necessary improvements.</span></p>

<p><span>18.58.3.<b>&nbsp;Improving Organizational
Communication.</b></span></p>

<p><span>A
lack of information can be a significant stressor. As a supervisor, you should
do your best to keep your subordinates informed about anything that could
impact their lives. In addition, you should practice good communication skills,
like active listening, being open minded and avoiding prejudging, and humility.
These skills not only will help reduce stress, but also promote trust,
cooperation, and teamwork within the work center.</span></p>

<p><span>18.58.4.&nbsp;<b>Personnel Selection and Job
Placement.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Having
the wrong person in a job position can create a great deal of stress for the
individual and others. When possible, you should carefully match individuals to
a position they are qualified for based on their skills, level of experience,
and rank. In the military, this might not be the easiest thing to do, but you
should keep in mind the potential stress-related benefits of having the right
person in the right position.</span></p>

<p><span>18.58.5.&nbsp;<b>Workplace Conflict.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Having
conflict with co-workers can cause serious stress within the work center. Look
for ways to help resolve any issues you or subordinates may have with others.
Sit down and talk with the person with whom you are having conflict with,
listen to their point of view and understand what the other person is saying,
communicate your point of view in a calm and professional way, and try to come
to an agreement or compromise. If the conflict can t be resolved amongst
yourselves you may need to have a mediator to help resolve the
issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>18.58.6.&nbsp;<b>Substance Abuse Programs.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Sometimes
stress can cause people to resort to excessive amounts of alcohol and/or drugs
which can have a dramatically negative effect on mission, morale, and
readiness. All supervisors are responsible and accountable for managing
substance abusers in accordance with applicable directives and getting them the
help they need.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 18J Redeployment
Support Process</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>18.59. Purpose.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
positive and sustained care, control, and discipline of each Airman is the
purpose of the redeployment support process. The goal is to ensure personnel
readiness throughout the air and space expeditionary force cycle by providing
timely support for our military members and their families. Redeployment
support is an ongoing process, not a homecoming event. The intent is to provide
continuous, integrated support from the area of responsibility to home station
and to assist in the transition from the deployed environment to family life
and work site.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.60. Recovery.</span></b></p>

<p><span>After
periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment, a lengthy respite
from the deployment environment has a beneficial effect on an individual s
psychological and physical status. An immediate recovery period also provides
time for the returning Airman to tend to personal needs neglected during
lengthy periods away from home. Each major command is responsible for
establishing and publishing personnel recovery (leave, passes, attribution, and
retention) policies for returning combat forces. See AFI 36-3003,&nbsp;<i>Military
Leave Program</i>, for guidance.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.61. Reconstitution.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Although
recovery is important to support returning forces as they transition back to
their normal environment, they also must be reconstituted for further
deployment possibilities, including surge requirements. This process entails
planning that will return units back to full combat capability in a short time.
While there is no one correct rule set for reconstitution planning,
consideration must be given to prioritizing and restoring levels of consumables
expended during the crisis, and recovering lost training. Every base/unit must
assess their own situation based on such variables as the magnitude, duration,
and intensity of a crisis, consumption rates, and the type of deployment
location (fixed versus austere base). See AFI 10401,&nbsp;<i>Air Force
Operations Planning and Execution</i>, for further guidance on reconstitution.</span></p>

<p><b><span>18.62. Scope.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force redeployment support process applies to deployed area of
responsibility and home stations. All personnel deployed to an area of
responsibility, to continental United States locations in support of
contingencies, and to remote assignments are included. Key determinants for
participation are lengthy family separation and significant family related
stressors prior to reintegration. Community Action Information Board and
Integrated Delivery System helping agencies complete specified activities to
support redeployed Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve,
military and civilian personnel, their family members, and units during the air
and space expeditionary force cycle. Readjustment from duty in the area of
responsibility requires structured recovery time and activities for members and
families prior to leave or temporary duty.</span></p>

information, education, and training.</span></p>

<p><span>18.64.1.&nbsp;<b>Personnel Readiness.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Personnel
readiness begins reintegration, and develops the reception station. Personnel
readiness will ensure procedures are established to account for members
returning from deployments. These procedures will be incorporated into
installation reconstitution planning and the installation deployment plan.
Returning units and individuals will in-process with the installation personnel
readiness element within 2 duty days of redeployment day. The installation
personnel readiness element will update the date of return to home station for
all individuals in Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments
on the date of notification of return according to AFI 36-3802,&nbsp;<i>Personnel
Readiness Operations</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>18.64.2.&nbsp;<b>Chaplain Service.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Chaplain
Corps members support personnel, families, and base populations during
contingencies according to AFI 52-104,&nbsp;<i>Chaplain Service Readiness</i>.
At home station following deployment, chaplain service members provide
follow-up support, reintegration and reunion ministries, and other programs to
strengthen families and enhance individual spiritual health. Post-deployment
services at Air Force Reserve Command wings will be coordinated with the
reserve wing deployment support program point of contact.</span></p>

<p><span>18.64.3.&nbsp;<b>Airman and Family Readiness
Center.</b></span></p>

<p><span>18.64.3.1. The Airman
and Family Readiness Center provides mobility and deployment assistance to help
single and married Department of Defense personnel and families meet
predeployment, deployment, and post deployment challenges, according to AFI
36-3009,&nbsp;<i>Airman and Family Readiness Centers</i>. Services help reduce
stress and deal with separation and reintegration, increase individual and
family morale and unit cohesion, and support operational readiness.</span></p>

<p><span>18.64.3.2.
Airman and Family Readiness Centers use electronic media and hard copies to
help develop reintegration educational material and provide materials support
to the chaplain and mental health services in the area of responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span>18.64.3.3.
During deployments, Airman and Family Readiness Center staffs tailor support to
commanders, units, and families; work with local school authorities and
teachers to help them understand stressors unique to children of deployed military;
provide a myriad deployment support programs; and distribute commercial,
printed materials addressing deployment. Upon request, one-on-one counseling is
available. The Airman and Family Readiness Center staff provides support to the
parents and siblings of single Airmen.</span></p>

<p><span>18.64.3.4. Post
deployment assistance is linked to pre-deployment activities, particularly
early intervention to educate families, single members, and units on concerns
related to reunion and reintegration. The Airman and Family Readiness Center
staff monitors family coping skills, assists potential at-risk families, and
collaborates with Community Action Information Board and Integrated Delivery
System agencies to ensure smooth family reunions.</span></p>

<p><span>18.64.4.&nbsp;<b>Force Support Squadron and Family
Member Program Protocols.</b></span></p>

<p><span>These
protocols help bases respond to increased childcare needs during contingencies
and during the Air and Space Expeditionary Force cycle, in accordance with AFI
34-144,&nbsp;<i>Child and Youth Programs</i>. Childcare providers receive
training on caring for children who are experiencing family separation and
reintegration, or whose parents are working extended hours.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>SECURITY</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 19A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>19.1. Introduction.</span></b><span>&nbsp;The purpose of security is to never permit the enemy to
acquire unexpected advantage The lethal consequences of enemy attack make the
security of friendly forces a paramount concern. Security applies to all
members of the Air Force at all times. In certain positions, Airmen are
required to handle classified information; at other times, Airmen may be
required to serve in a foreign country. Such is the diversity of security. This
chapter covers information assurance, installation security, and antiterrorism.
These topics are essential to the Air Force mission and the security of all
resources. Along with information presented in Chapters 5, Emergency Management
Program, and 6, Standards of Conduct, this information helps ensure Air Force
forces are prepared to face any adversary.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 19B Information
Assurance</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>19.2. Information Assurance:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.2.1.
Information assurance refers to the measures that protect and defend
information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity,
confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. These measures include
providing for restoration of information and information systems by
incorporating protection, detection, and reaction capabilities.</span></p>

<p><span>19.2.2.
The Air Force implements and maintains the information assurance program to
secure information and information technology assets. The Air Force achieves
these objectives through the effective employment of its core information
assurance disciplines of computer security, communications security, and
TEMPEST (formerly known as emissions security).</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.3. Computer Security:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Definition.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Computer
security consists of measures and controls that ensure confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information systems assets including hardware,
software, firmware, and information being processed, stored, and communicated.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.1.1.
Limited Authorized Personal Use. Government-provided hardware and software are
for official use and limited authorized personal use only. Limited personal use
must be of reasonable duration and frequency that have been approved by the
supervisors and do not adversely affect performance of official duties,
overburden systems or reflect adversely on the Air Force or the Department of
Defense.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.1.2. All personal
use must be consistent with the requirements of Department of Defense 5500.7-R,
Joint Ethics Regulation.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.1.3. Internet-based
capabilities are all publicly accessible information capabilities and
applications available across the Internet in locations not owned, operated, or
controlled by the Department of Defense or the Federal Government.
Internet-based capabilities include collaborative tools such as simple
notification service, social media, user-generated content, social software,
e-mail, instant messaging, and discussion forums (e.g., YouTube, Facebook,
MySpace, Twitter, Google Apps, etc.).</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.1.4.
When accessing Internet-based capabilities using Federal Government resources
in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals shall comply with
operations security guidance (AFI 10-701,&nbsp;<i>Operations Security</i>) and
shall not represent the policies or official position of the Air Force or
Department of Defense.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Information Systems.</b></span></p>

<p><span>An
information system is a discrete set of information resources organized for the
collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination or disposition
of information. Note: Information Systems also include specialized systems such
as industrial/process controls systems, telephone switching and private branch
systems, and environmental control systems.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Countermeasures.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Every Air Force
information system has vulnerabilities (system security weaknesses) and is
susceptible to exploitation (to gain access to information or disrupt critical
processing). A countermeasure is any action, device, procedure, or technique
that meets or opposes (i.e. counters) a threat, vulnerability or attack by
eliminating, preventing, or minimizing damage, or by discovering and reporting
the event, so corrective action(s) can be taken.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.4.&nbsp;<b>Threats.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Not
all threats to our national security are conventional in nature. Threats
include, but are not limited to any circumstance or event with the potential to
adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions,
image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,
or the Nation through an information system via unauthorized access,
destruction, disclosure, modification of information and/or denial of service.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.5.&nbsp;<b>Malicious Logic Protection.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
Air Force must protect information systems from viruses and other forms of
malicious logic by using a combination of human and technological
countermeasures to ensure the protection is maintained throughout the lifecycle
of the information system.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.5.1.&nbsp;<b>Infection.</b>&nbsp;The
invasion of information systems applications, processes, or services by a virus
or malware code causing the information system to malfunction.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.5.2.&nbsp;<b>Detection.</b>&nbsp;A
signature or behavior-based antivirus system that signals when an anomaly
caused by a virus or malware occurs.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.5.3.&nbsp;<b>Reaction.</b>&nbsp;If
you are notified of a virus or malware detection, immediately notify your
information system security officer and follow local procedures.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.6.&nbsp;<b>General Protection of
Information Systems.</b></span></p>

<p><span>All authorized users
must protect information systems against tampering, theft, and loss. Protection
from insider and outsider threats occurs by controlling physical access to the
facility and data.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.6.1.
Ensure user access to information system resources and information is based
upon their security clearance and need to know. Ensure protection of applicable
unclassified, sensitive, and/or classified information using encryption
according to the applicable Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
140-2,&nbsp;<i>Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.6.2.
Protect against casual viewing of information. Place devices that display (or
output) classified and sensitive information in a location that deters
unauthorized individuals from reading the information. Ensure buildings and
rooms that contain information systems are locked during non-duty hours.
Classified information systems should be stored in a General Services
Administration approved safe or in buildings or areas cleared for open storage
of classified.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.7.&nbsp;<b>Removable Media Control.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Storage
media includes, but is not limited to, compact discs, external storage drives,
and universal serial bus drives (memory sticks, jump drives, pen drives, etc.).
These devices have memory storage capability and are categorized as removable
media. Because of the capacity of their memory storage and their portable
nature, these devices pose an increased risk of data tampering, theft, or loss.
At a minimum, personnel must use these preventive measures:</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.7.1. Safeguard,
mark, and label removable media according to the requirements for the highest
level of information ever contained on the media using applicable information
security guidance.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.7.2. Report loss or
suspected loss of removable media containing sensitive information according to
applicable information security guidance from your local security manager or
information systems security officer.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.7.3.
Clear, sanitize, or destroy removable media used to store sensitive information
before releasing to unauthorized personnel or outside Department of Defense or
Air Force control. Contact your local information systems security officer for
guidance and procedures.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.7.4. Use your local
security guidance before attaching any removable media or storage device to an
information system.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.7.5.
Do not use disguised removable media or storage devices. Air Force policy
defines disguised as a device designed to look like anything other than
removable media or a storage device (for example, watch, pen, flashlight,
etc.).</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.8.&nbsp;<b>Mobile Computing Devices.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Mobile computing devices
are information systems such as portable electronic devices, laptops,
smartphones, and other handheld devices that can store data locally and access
Air Force managed networks through mobile access capabilities. While many
mobile computing devices may have specific security policy and procedures
governing their use, all of these devices should follow the same basic
requirements.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.8.1.
All wireless systems (including associated peripheral devices, operation
systems, applications, network connection methods, and services) must be
approved prior to processing Department of Defense information. The information
systems security officer will maintain documented approval authority and
inventory information on all approved devices.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.8.2. All mobile
computing devices (not assigned or in use) must be secured to prevent tampering
or theft.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.8.3. Users of
mobile devices will sign a detailed user agreement outlining the
responsibilities and restrictions for use.</span></p>

<p><span>19.3.9.&nbsp;<b>Public Computing Facilities or
Services.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Do
not use public computing facilities or services (Internet caf's and kiosks,
hotel business centers, etc.) to process government-owned unclassified,
sensitive, or classified information. Public computing facilities or services
include any information technology resources not under your private or United
States governmental control. Use of these resources to access Web-based
government services (Outlook  messaging software, Web applications, etc.) constitutes
a compromise of login credentials and must be reported as a security incident
according to the current Air Force guidance on computer security.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.4. Communications Security.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Communications
security refers to measures and controls taken to deny unauthorized persons
information derived from information systems of the United States government
related to national security and to ensure the authenticity of such information
systems. Communications security protection results from applying security
measures (i.e., crypto security, transmission security, and emission security)
to communications and information systems generating, handling, storing,
processing, or using classified or sensitive information, the loss of which
could adversely affect the national security interest. Communications security
also entails applying physical security measures to communications security
information or materials.</span></p>

<p><span>19.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Cryptosecurity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Cryptosecurity is a
component of communications security resulting from the provision and proper
use of technically sound cryptosystems.</span></p>

<p><span>19.4.2.<b>&nbsp;Transmission Security.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Transmission
security is a component of communications security resulting from the
application of measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and
exploitation by means other than cryptoanalysis. Examples of transmission
security measures include using secured communications systems, registered
mail, secure telephone and facsimile equipment, manual cryptosystems, call
signs, or authentication to transmit classified information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Physical Security.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Physical
security is the part of communications security resulting from the use of all
physical measures necessary to safeguard communications security material from
access by unauthorized persons. Physical security measures include the
application of control procedures and physical barriers. Physical security also
ensures continued integrity, prevents access by unauthorized persons, and
controls the spread of communications security techniques and technology when
not in the best interest of the United States and allies of the United States.
Common physical security measures include verifying the need to know and
clearance of personnel granted access, following proper storage and handling
procedures, accurately accounting for all materials, transporting materials
using authorized means, and immediately reporting the loss or possible
compromise of materials.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.5. TEMPEST (formerly known as Emissions
Security).</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>TEMPEST</span></b><span>&nbsp;is protection
resulting from all measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of
value that may be derived from the interception and analysis of compromising
emanations from crypto equipment, information systems, and telecommunications
systems. The objective of emissions security is to deny access to classified
and, in some instances, unclassified information that contain compromising
emanations within an inspectable space. The inspectable space is considered the
area in which it would be difficult for an adversary with specialized equipment
to attempt to intercept compromising emanations without being detected. TEMPEST
countermeasures (classified/unclassified equipment separation, shielding,
grounding, etc.) are implemented to reduce the risk of compromising emanations
escaping the inspectable space. The TEMPEST countermeasures must be validated
by the Certified TEMPEST Technical Authority prior to any classified processing
in the facility.</span></p>



<p><b><i><span>Section 19C Installation
Security</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>19.6. Operations Security:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Operations Security Defined:</b></span></p>

<p><span>19.6.1.1. Operation
security is a process of identifying, analyzing, and controlling critical
information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and
other activities to:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;19.6.1.1.1.
Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;19.6.1.2.2.
Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and
interpreted to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;19.6.1.3.3. Select
and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
vulnerabilities of&nbsp;friendly actions to adversary exploitation.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.1.2. Operation
security is closely integrated and synchronized with other influence operations
capabilities to protect operations and is not a collection of specific rules
and instructions that can be applied to every operation.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Purpose.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
purpose of Operation security is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force
missions by eliminating or reducing successful adversary collection and
exploitation of critical information. Operation security applies to all
activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of
operations.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.3.<b>&nbsp;Operational Context.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Operational
effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision makers apply Operation
security from the earliest stages of planning. Operation security involves a
series of analyses to examine the planning, preparation, execution, and post
execution phases of any operation or activity across the entire spectrum of
military action and in any operational environment. Operation security analysis
provides decision makers with a means of weighing the risk to their operations.
Decision makers must determine the amount of risk they are willing to accept in
particular operational circumstances in the same way as operations risk
management allows commanders to assess risk in mission planning.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.4.&nbsp;<b>Signature Management Methodology
Defined:</b></span></p>

<p><span>19.6.4.1.
Signature management is the active defense or exploitation of operational
profiles resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational
profiles is accomplished by implementing protective signature management
measures to deny adversary collection of critical information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.4.2.
Base profiling is a process within signature management that identifies the
local operating environment and captures process points that present key
signatures and profiles with critical information value. This process is the
deliberate effort to identify functional areas and the observables they produce
to contribute to the overall signature of day-to-day activities and operational
trends.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.5.<b>&nbsp;Implementing Operation Security.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air
Force forces can be under observation at their peacetime bases and locations,
in training or exercises, while moving, or when deployed to the field
conducting actual operations. Operation security methodology provides
systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify observable friendly
actions that could reveal intentions or capabilities. Air Force units utilize
the base profiling process to identify vulnerabilities and indicators of their
day-to-day activities. With this understanding, Air Force operation security
program managers use the signature management methodology to apply measures
and/or countermeasures to hide, control, or simulate
indicators.&nbsp;Therefore, operation security principles must be
integrated into operational, support, exercise, and acquisition planning.
Operation security is incorporated into day-to-day activities to ensure a seamless
transition to contingency operations. The operation security process consists
of five distinct steps:</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.5.1. Identify
critical information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.5.2. Analyze
threats.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.5.3. Analyze
vulnerabilities.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.5.4. Assess risk.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.5.5. Apply
appropriate operation security countermeasures.</span></p>



<p><span>19.6.6.&nbsp;<b>Operation Security Indicators.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Operation
security indicators are friendly, detectable actions, and open-source
information that can be interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to
derive critical information. The five basic characteristics of operation
security indicators that make them potentially valuable to an adversary
include:</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Signatures.&nbsp;</b>This
characteristic of an indicator is identifiable or to stand out.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Associations.&nbsp;</b>The
relationship of an indicator to other information or activities.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Profiles.&nbsp;</b>Each
functional activity generates their own set of more-or-less unique signatures
and associations. The sum of these signatures and associations is the
activity's profile.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.6.4.&nbsp;<b>Contrasts.&nbsp;</b>Any
differences observed between an activity's standard profile and most recent or
current actions.</span></p>

<p><span>19.6.6.5.&nbsp;<b>Exposure.&nbsp;</b>Refers
to when and for how long an indicator is observed. The longer an indicator is
observed, the better chance an adversary can observe the indicator and form
associations and/or update the profile of operational activities.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.7. Information Security.</span></b></p>

<p><span>All personnel in the Air
Force are responsible for protecting classified information and controlled
unclassified information under their custody and control.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.<b>&nbsp;Classified
Information.&nbsp;</b>Information shall be classified only to protect national
security. There are three levels of classification: Top Secret, Secret, and
Confidential. Information may only be classified by either original
classification or derivative classification. Each individual is responsible for
providing the proper safeguards for classified information, reporting security
incidents, and understand the sanctions for noncompliance.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Top
Secret.</b>&nbsp;Top Secret shall be applied to information the unauthorized
disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave
damage to the national security that the original classification authority is
able to identify or describe.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Secret.</b>&nbsp;Secret
shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably
could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the
original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Confidential</b>.
Confidential shall be applied to information the unauthorized disclosure of
which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security
that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.4.<b>&nbsp;Original
Classification.&nbsp;</b>Original classification is the initial decision by an
original classification authority that an item of information could reasonably
be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national
security subjected to unauthorized disclosure and requires protection in the
interest of national security. Only officials designated in writing may make
original classification decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.5.&nbsp;<b>Derivative
Classification</b>. Air Force policy is to identify, classify, downgrade,
declassify, mark, protect, and destroy classified information consistent with
national policy. Controlled unclassified information will also be protected per
national policy, DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1 and 4,&nbsp;<i>Department of Defense
Information Security Program</i>:&nbsp;<i>Overview, Classification, and
Declassification</i>, February 24, 2012 and DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2 and 3,&nbsp;<i>Department
of Defense Information Security Program</i>, February 24, 2012, Incorporating
Change 2, March 19, 2013,&nbsp;<i>Department of Defense Information Security
Program,</i>&nbsp;and AFI 16-1404, Air Force&nbsp;<i>Information Security
Program,&nbsp;</i>provide the guidance for managing classified information and
controlled unclassified information. Within the Department of Defense all
cleared personnel are authorized to derivatively classify information provided
they have received initial training before making derivative classification
decisions and refresher at least once every 2 years. Derivative classification
is the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating, or generating classified
information in a new form or document and is not photocopying or otherwise
mechanically or electronically reproducing classified material. Derivative
classifiers must use authorized types of sources for making decisions. One of
the most important responsibilities of derivative classifier is to observe and
respect the classification determinations made by an original classification
authority.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.&nbsp;<b>Marking
Classified Information.</b>&nbsp;All classified information shall be clearly
identified by marking, designation, or electronic labelling in accordance with
DoDM 5200.01, Vol 2,<i>&nbsp;Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>:&nbsp;<i>Marking
of Classified Information</i>. Markings are used to:</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.1. Alert
holders to the presence of classified information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.2. Identify, as
specifically as possible, the exact information needing protection.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.3. Indicate the
level of classification assigned to the information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.4. Provide
guidance on downgrading (if any) and declassification.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.5. Give
information on the sources of and reasons for classification.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.6. Notify
holders of special access, control, or safeguarding requirements.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.6.7. Promote
information sharing, facilitate judicious use of resources, and simplify
management through implementation of uniform and standardized processes.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.7.&nbsp;<b>Specific
Markings on Documents.&nbsp;</b>Every classified document must be marked to
show the highest classification of information contained within the document.
The marking must be conspicuous enough to alert anyone handling the document
that the document is classified. Every document will contain the overall
classification of the document, portion markings indicating the classification
level of specific classified information within the document, the originating
office, date of origin, and downgrading instructions, if any, and
declassification instructions. The three most common markings on a classified
document are the banner lines, portion markings, and the classification
authority block.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.7.1.&nbsp;<b>Banner
Lines.</b>&nbsp;Are conspicuously placed at the top and bottom of the outside
of the front cover (if any), title page (if any), first page, and on the
outside of the back cover (if any or last page of each classified document.
These markings are usually centered on the page. Examples of Banner Markings in
DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2,&nbsp;<i>DoD Information Security Program</i>:&nbsp;<i>Marking
of Classified Information</i>&nbsp;for an illustration.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.7.2.&nbsp;<b>Portion
Marks.</b>&nbsp;Every subject, title, paragraph, section, tab, attachment,
classified signature block, bullets, tables and pictures in every classified
document shall be marked to show the highest level of classification contained
within the document. Use these symbols in uppercase letters to indicate the
highest classification level in the portion: (TS) for Top Secret, (S) for
Secret, and (C) for Confidential. Examples of Portion Markings in DoDM 5200.01,
Volume 2,&nbsp;<i>Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>:&nbsp;<i>Marking
of Classified Information</i>, for illustration.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.7.3.&nbsp;<b>Classification
Authority Block.</b>&nbsp;This block appears on the face of each classified
United States document unless otherwise stated in DoDM 5200.01, Volumes 1-4.
There are two types of classification authority blocks. One is used by an
original classifier and the other by a derivative classifier. Original
classification authority block will contain a: Classified By (name of
classifier), Reason, Downgrade To (if any), and Declassify On line. Refer to
DoDM 5200.01, Volume 2,&nbsp;<i>Department of Defense Information Security
Program</i>:&nbsp;<i>Marking of Classified Information</i>, for an illustration
of an Originally Classified Document. Derivative classification authority block
will contain a: Classified by (name of classifier), Derived From (identify
sources), Downgrade To (if any) and Declassify On lines. Refer to DoDM 5200.01,
Volume 2,&nbsp;<i>Department of Defense Information Security Program</i>:&nbsp;<i>Marking
of Classified Information</i>, for an illustration of an Derivatively
Classified Document.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.8.&nbsp;<b>Challenges.&nbsp;</b>Personnel
should submit challenges of classification to their security manager or the
classifier of the information if substantial reason exists to indicate the
document has been classified improperly or unnecessarily</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.<b>&nbsp;Safeguarding.</b>&nbsp;Everyone
who works with classified information is personally responsible for taking
proper precautions to ensure that unauthorized persons do not gain access to
classified information. There are two primary types of protection that must be
employed at all times: (1) store the information using approved means; or (2)
having it under the personal observation and control of an authorized
individual.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.1.&nbsp;<b>Access
to Classified Information.</b>&nbsp;Before granting access to classified
information the person must have: (1) security clearance eligibility; (2) a
signed Standard Form 312,&nbsp;<i>Classified Information Non-Disclosure
Agreement</i>; and (3) a need-to-know. The individual's responsibility with
authorized possession, knowledge, or control of the information is to determine
whether the person receiving the information has been granted the appropriate
security clearance access by proper authority.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.2.&nbsp;<b>Protection
When Under Personal Observation or Control.</b>&nbsp;An authorized person shall
keep classified material removed from storage under constant surveillance. The
authorized person must place coversheets on classified documents not in secure
storage to prevent unauthorized persons from viewing the information. The
following forms will be used to cover classified information outside of
storage: Standard Form 703,&nbsp;<i>Top Secret</i>, Standard Form 704,&nbsp;<i>Secret</i>,
and Standard Form 705,&nbsp;<i>Confidential</i>.</span></p>



<p><span>19.7.1.9.3.&nbsp;<b>End-of-Day Security Checks.</b>&nbsp;Use
Standard Form 701,&nbsp;<i>Activity Security Checklist</i>, to record the end
of the day security check if you are appointed to conduct the check. This form
is required for any area where classified information is used or stored. Ensure
all vaults, secure rooms, and containers used for storing classified material
are checked.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.4.&nbsp;<b>Security
Incidents Involving Classified Information.</b>&nbsp;Anyone finding classified
material out of proper control must take custody of and safeguard the material
and immediately notify his or her commander, supervisor or security manager.
The terms associated with security incidents are formally defined DoDM 5200.01
Volume 3. The following general characterizations are provided:</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Infraction.</b>&nbsp;An
infraction is a security incident involving failure to comply with requirements
which cannot reasonably be expected to, and does not, result in the loss,
suspected compromise, or compromise of classified information. An infraction
may be unintentional or inadvertent and does not constitute a security
violation, if left uncorrected, can lead to security violations or compromises.
Infraction requires an inquiry to facilitate immediate corrective action but
does not require an in-depth investigation.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Violation.</b>&nbsp;Violations
are security incidents that indicate knowing, willful, and negligent for
security regulations, and result in, or could be expected to result in, the
loss or compromise of classified information. Security violations require an
inquiry and/or investigation.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Compromise.</b>&nbsp;A
compromise is a security incident (more specifically, a violation) in which
there is an unauthorized disclosure of classified information (i.e., disclosure
to a person(s) who does not have a valid clearance, authorized access, or a
need to know).</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.4.4.&nbsp;<b>Loss.</b>&nbsp;A
loss occurs when classified information cannot be physically located or
accounted for (e.g., classified information/equipment is discovered missing
during an audit and cannot be immediately located).</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.5.&nbsp;<b>Data
Spills</b>. Classified data spills occur when classified data is introduced
either onto an unclassified information system or to an information system with
a lower level of classification, or to a system not accredited to process data
of that restrictive category.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.1.9.6.&nbsp;<b>Information
Appearing in the Public Media.&nbsp;</b>If classified information appears in
the public media, including on public Internet sites, or if approached by a
representative of the media, personnel shall be careful not to make any
statement or comment that confirms the accuracy of or verifies the information
requiring protection. Immediately report the matter to your supervisor,
security manager, or commander, but do not discuss with anyone who does not, in
the case of classified information, have an appropriate security clearance and
need to know.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.&nbsp;<b>Controlled Unclassified
Information.</b></span></p>

<p><span>In
addition to classified information, certain types of unclassified information
also require application of access and distribution controls and protective
measures for a variety of reasons. Such information is referred to collectively
as controlled unclassified information. Requirements, controls, and protective
measures developed for Department of Defense controlled unclassified
information (i.e., For Official Use Only), (Law Enforcement Sensitive,
Department of Defense Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information, and LIMITED
DISTRIBUTION) as well as some of those developed by other Executive Branch
agencies are found in DoDM 5200.01 Volume 4. The originator of a document is
responsible for determining at origination whether the information may qualify
for controlled unclassified information status. Before provided to the public
all Department of Defense unclassified information must be reviewed and
approved for release.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.1.&nbsp;<b>For
Official Use Only Information.</b>&nbsp;For official use only information is
the most commonly used controlled unclassified information category in the Air
Force and Department of Defense. For official use only information is a
dissemination control applied by the Department of Defense to unclassified
information when disclosure to the public of that particular record, or portion
thereof, would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an
interest protected by one or more of the Freedom of Information Act Exemptions
2 through 9. Refer to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4,&nbsp;<i>Department of Defense
Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information</i>&nbsp;for
additional information on Freedom of Information Act exemptions.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Marking
For Official Use Only information.</b>&nbsp;Information that has been
determined to qualify for official use only status shall be indicated by markings.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.2.1. Each
document will identify the originating office to allow someone receiving the
document to contact the office if questions or problems about the designation
or marking arise.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.2.2.
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY or UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY will be marked at
the bottom of the outside of the front cover (if there is one), the title page,
the first page, and the outside of the back cover (if there is one).</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.2.3.
Internal pages shall be marked FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY. If internal pages contain
UNCLASSIFIED//FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY or UNCLASSIFIED// For Official Use Only
information the marking must appear at both the top and bottom.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.2.4. Subjects,
titles, and each section, part, paragraph, or similar port shall be marked using
the parenthetical notation (For Official Use Only) or (U// For Official Use
Only if it contains For Official Use Only information).</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Access
to For Official Use Only.</b>&nbsp;No person may have access to information
designated as For Official Use Only information unless they have a valid need
for access in connection with the accomplishment of a lawful and authorized
Government purpose. The final responsibility for determining whether an
individual has a valid need for access to information designated for official
use only status rests with the individual who has authorized possession,
knowledge, or control of the information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.7.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Protection
of For Official Use Only.</b>&nbsp;During work hours, reasonable steps shall be
taken to minimize the risk of access by unauthorized personnel, i.e. not
leaving for official use only status information unattended where unauthorized
personnel are present. After working hours, store the information in unlocked
containers, desks, or cabinets if the building is provided security by
Government or Government-contract personnel. If building security is not
provided or deemed inadequate, store the information in locked desks, file
cabinets, bookcases, or locked rooms.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.8. Personnel Security:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.8.1.
The Personnel Security Program entails policies and procedures that ensure
military, civilian, and contractor personnel who access classified information
or occupy a sensitive position are consistent with interests of national
security.&nbsp;It involves the investigation process, adjudication for
eligibility, and the continuous evaluation for maintaining
eligibility.&nbsp;Commanders and supervisors must continually observe and
evaluate their subordinates with respect to these criteria and immediately
report any unfavorable conduct or conditions that come to their attention that
might bear on the subordinates' trustworthiness and eligibility to occupy a
sensitive position or have eligibility to classified information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.8.2.
The Department of Defense Central Adjudication Facility is the designated
adjudicative authority to grant, deny, and revoke security clearance
eligibility. Eligibility is adjudicated using the Department of Defense 13
Adjudicative Guidelines while applying the whole person concept and mitigating
factors. Individuals are granted due process and may appeal if the security
clearance eligibility is denied or revoked. Refer to the AFI 31-501, Personnel
Security Program Management for details.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>19.8.2.1. The Department
of Defense 13 Adjudicative Guidelines include the following topic areas:</span></p>

<p><span>19.8.2.1.1. Allegiance
to the United States.</span></p>

<p><span>19.8.2.1.2. Foreign
Influence.</span></p>

<p><span>19.8.2.1.3. Foreign
Preference.</span></p>

<p><span>19.8.2.1.4. Sexual

<p><span>19.8.2.1.13. Use of
Information Technology.</span></p>

<p><span>19.8.3. All personnel
with clearance eligibility are subject to continuous evaluation. This requires
reporting post investigation information that falls within the Department of
Defense 13 Adjudicative Guidelines to the security manager.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>19.8.3.1. The Commander
will report all continuous evaluation information related to the 13
Adjudicative Guidelines to the Department of Defense Central Adjudication
Facility via the security manager.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.9. Industrial Security:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.9.1.&nbsp;<b>Policy.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air Force policy is to
identify in classified contracts specific government information and sensitive
resources that must be protected against compromise or loss while entrusted to
industry. AFI 31-601,&nbsp;<i>Industrial Security Program Management,&nbsp;</i>assigns
functional responsibilities and establishes a system of review that identifies
outdated, inappropriate, and unnecessary contractual security requirements.
Policy also outlines and provides guidance for establishing on-base integrated
contractor visitor groups.</span></p>

<p><span>19.9.2.&nbsp;<b>Scope.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The
security policies, requirements, and procedures identified in AFI 31-601 are
applicable to Air Force personnel and on-base Department of Defense contractors
performing services under the terms of a properly executed contract and
associated security agreement or similar document, as determined appropriate by
the installation commander.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.10. Integrated Defense Program:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.10.1.
The Air Force Integrated Defense Program is the integration of
multidisciplinary active and passive, offensive and defensive capabilities,
employed to mitigate potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force
operations within the base boundary and the base security zone. These threats
include, but are not limited to, terrorist, insiders, criminals, and foreign
intelligence and security services. To integrate Integrated Defense efforts
with other Air Force capabilities to achieve synergistic effects using an
all-hazards approach is critical. Potential hazards to an installation include,
but are not limited to, chemical biological radiological nuclear-high yield explosive
attacks, natural and man-made disasters, major accidents, and accidental or
deliberate release of hazardous materials, toxic industrial materials or
chemicals (see AFPD 31-1,&nbsp;<i>Integrated Defense</i>). Integrated Defense
is a fundamental battle competency for all Airmen, whether garrison or
deployed. The teaming of Integrated Defense forces creates a united, seamless
defense stronger than the defensive efforts of individuals/or individual units.
This effort ensures all Airmen are trained to defend themselves and integrate
into defense operations while in garrison or deployed. Installation commanders
determine the effects required of Integrated Defense operations at Air Force
installations based on a four-step process that involves:&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>19.10.1.1. Determining
and prioritizing the criticality of installation assets.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.1.2. Analyzing the
threats and operating environment.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.1.3. Assessing the
installation's vulnerabilities to the threats.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.1.4. Making
prudent integrated defense decisions based on the risk estimate. The integrated
defense risk management process is critical in order for the installation
commander to make the best use of limited resources and personnel available to
execute the Integrated Defense mission.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.2.
Integrated defense is an  all-Airmen  program. However, Air Force Security
Forces have enterprise lead in Integrated Defense operations. The defense force
commander synchronizes integrated defense operations with emergency and
consequence management activities articulated in applicable Air Force and
Department of Defense publications.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.3.
The goal of Integrated Defense is to neutralize security threats within the
base boundary and the base security zone in order to ensure unhindered Air
Force operations. Through Integrated Defense, commanders must: (1) minimize
mission degradation from threat activity within the base boundary and
coordinate necessary security operations support within the base security zone
when the base security zone is not congruent with the base boundary; (2)
minimize loss of life and injury from threat activity; and (3) protect
government property and personnel from hostile and criminal acts.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.4.
Integrated Defense does not stand alone to protect personnel and resources;
planners create an effective security program by coordinating with other
Department of Defense and Air Force programs. Furthermore, the protection and
defense of air bases requires the coordinated effort of emergency management,
antiterrorism, and other mission support function forces under the mission
assurance umbrella. This coordinated planning provides a seamless progression
of mission assurance programs and completes the installation's defense in depth
picture.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.5.<b>&nbsp;</b>Joint
Publications define the base boundary as a line that delineates the surface
area of a base for the purpose of facilitating coordination and deconfliction
of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas. See Figure 19.1 for
an example of a base boundary configuration. Therefore, the base boundary is
not necessarily the base perimeter. Rather, the base boundary should be
established based upon the factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather,
troops and support available, time available, civil considerations,
specifically balancing the need of the base defense forces to control key
terrain with their ability to accomplish the mission. These measures decrease
the likelihood of fratricide, prevent noncombatant casualties, and minimize
damage to the property of friendly civilians. Boundaries may not necessarily
coincide with the fenced perimeter, property lines or legal boundaries.
Nevertheless, while tactical considerations will ideally determine Integrated
Defense boundaries, the defense force commander will strictly adhere to legal,
jurisdictional, host nation constraints, commander's intent, and higher echelon
orders and directives when conducting operations within the base boundary.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.6.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
base security zone is an Air Force unique concept and term to be used
intraservice only. The Air Force uses the planning term base security zone to
describe the area of concern around an air base and to support the
establishment and adjustment of the base boundary. The base security zone is
the area outside the base perimeter from which the base</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="358" height="232" src="afh1_files/image252.png" ></span><b><span>Figure 19.1. Base Boundary
Configuration&nbsp;</span></b><span>may be vulnerable from standoff threats (for
example, mortars, rockets, man portable aerial defense systems). The
installation commander should identify the base security zone and coordinate
via the operational chain of command with local, state, federal agencies
(within the continental United States) or host nation or area commander
(outside the continental United States) for the base security zone to be
identified as the base boundary. If the base boundary does not include all of
the base security zone terrain, the installation commander is still
responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;either&nbsp;mitigating&nbsp;(through
coordination with local, state, federal agencies (continental United States) or
the area commander or host nation (outside the continental United States) or
accepting the risks of enemy attack from the terrain outside the base boundary.
The base security zone, in the simplest terms, is the area from which a threat
can launch an attack against base personnel and resources or aircraft
approaching/departing the base. Air-minded forces must consider the base
security zone for planning constructs continental United States, outside the
continental United States, and at contingency locations. Threats vary in the
Integrated Defense continuum from peacetime to wartime, regardless of the
location of our installations.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.6.1.
Optimally, the base security zone and the base boundary are the same, but that
is not always the case. The base security zone may, for planning purposes,
incorporate more geographical area than the base boundary. For example, there
may be key terrain outside the base boundary from which adversaries can impact
air operations.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.6.2.
For terrain outside the base boundary, but within the base security zone, the
defense force commander should coordinate with local, state, federal agencies
(continental United States) or host nation or area commander (outside the
continental United States) to conduct base defense tasks within the area. If
these forces/agencies are not available due to competing requirements, then the
defense force commander should coordinate via their operational chain of
command with the appropriate area commander to conduct the base defense task.
When defense forces operate outside the base boundary, the appropriate area of
operations commander should exercise tactical control over those forces for
base defense purposes only. Joint and coalition forces entering the base
boundary should inform the base defense operations center before they enter,
and monitor the base defense operations center's communication net while
operating in the area.</span></p>

<p><span>19.10.6.3.
The base defense operations center is the command and control center for
Integrated Defense operations during routine and emergency operations. The
defense force commander will establish a base defense operations center to
coordinate and direct, via their operational chain of command, the tactical
control of Integrated Defense forces and supporting capabilities. All functions
performed by central security control, the law enforcement desk, or other
security forces control centers will be performed by the base defense
operations center at all locations, home station and deployed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.11. Integrated Defense Effects:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.11.1. Commanders
execute Integrated Defense with the objective of achieving nine desired effects
based on the risk management process described in paragraph 19.12. Those
effects are:</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Anticipate.&nbsp;</b>Anticipate
threat intentions and actions (Intelligence Preparation of the Operational
Environment or crime trend analysis).</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Deter.&nbsp;</b>Deter
threat activity through active community policing (e.g., Eagle Eyes Program),
boundary and internal circulation control, controlled area marking, prudent
physical security measures.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Detect.&nbsp;</b>Detect
threats through the use of lighting, Intrusion Detection Systems/Early Warning
Systems, closed-circuit television, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.4.<b>&nbsp;Assess.&nbsp;</b>Assess
to identify friend or foe using cameras, posted sentries, response forces,
integrated delivery system, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.5.<b>&nbsp;Warn.&nbsp;</b>Warn
friendly forces of adversary activity through systems such as mass
notification, radio, public address, commander's access channels, voice, hand
and arm signals, cellular telephones, instant messenger/short message system
texting, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.6.&nbsp;<b>Defeat.&nbsp;</b>Defeat
threats through appropriate, progressive force application; coordinated
security force response; and integration of total force.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.7.&nbsp;<b>Delay.&nbsp;</b>Delay
adversaries using a layered application of barriers, obstacles, technology,
physical security measures, and forces (defense-in-depth).</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.8.&nbsp;<b>Defend.&nbsp;</b>Defend
assets through threat- and effects-based planning that integrates all friendly
forces into a single, comprehensive plan by ensuring friendly forces are
trained and qualified on Arming and Use of Force. Also, ensure the fighting
positions are positioned where prudent based on risk analyses.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.1.9.<b>&nbsp;Recover.&nbsp;</b>Recover
from adversarial events by applying effective command and control, and
developing and exercising comprehensive emergency management plan 10-2.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.2. These effects
are not randomly applied to an installation instead they are deliberately
achieved through innovative and reliable tactics, techniques, and procedures based
on the Integrated Defense risk management process and analysis.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.3.
Ideally, defense forces receive such good intelligence they are able to
anticipate any and all threats. As this is unlikely, attaining subsequent
Integrated Defense desired effects is necessary. For instance, it would be
preferred to deter a threat; but if that does not succeed, the next ideal
effect would be to detect the threat. Once the threat is detected, assessment
by forces occurs. Friendly forces are then warned of the threat and attempts
are made to defeat, or eliminate, the threat. If the threat cannot be defeated,
it must be delayed. If not possible, defensive measures must be taken to
mitigate the effects of the threat. Recovery actions are then implemented to
consolidate and reorganize friendly forces and restore operations.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>The
intelligence fusion cell is an action group whereby the security forces staff
S-2 (intelligence) function coordinates with subject matter experts from the
Intelligence and Air Force Office of Special investigations communities to
collaborate and conduct intelligence preparation of the operational
environment. The goal is to leverage information and intelligence to support
the timely identification of indicators and warnings of emerging localized
threats. The intelligence fusion cell and the products of the fusion cells are
the primary information sources that directly support the defense force
commander in making immediate, proactive decisions for Integrated Defense
planning.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.5.<b>&nbsp;</b>Intelligence
preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is an analytical methodology that
provides predictive intelligence to warfighters for use in planning and
executing operations. A systematic, four-step process, intelligence preparation
of the battlefield/battlespace's bottom line intent is to support operational
decisions by providing analyzed information regarding the threat and
environment<i>&nbsp;</i>in a given set of circumstances. Intelligence
preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is the primary mechanism used to
achieve the Integrated Defense desired effect of  anticipate.  Furthermore,
this analytical methodology is a continuous process, enabling the commander to
visualize: (1) the spectrum of friendly and adversarial capabilities and
weakness; (2) how they are affected by a variety of environmental factors (for
example; (3) weather, light, terrain, political and social conditions), and (4)
the logical predictions of the most likely and most dangerous enemy course of
action.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.6.
Intelligence preparation of the battlefield/battlespace is a continuous,
four-part process: (1) defines the operating environment; (2) describes the
operating environment's effects; (3) evaluates the enemy; and (4) determines
enemy course of action. The examples below should be collected, analyzed, and
applied to the tactical situation, as a minimum.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Part
1.</b>&nbsp;This part is comprised of comprehensive lists, dispositions, and
capabilities (offensive and defensive) of tasked friendly forces and other
forces (for example, host nation military and police forces, local, state,
national agencies [continental United States] and host nation [outside the
continental United States]) that contribute to the security of the installation
and are available to contribute during enemy surges (for example, increased
force protection conditions; terrain and weather (including light data); and
background data on the operating environment to include history, demographics,
socioeconomic data, religious groups, etc. Incident and emergency response
plans should also be identified in Part 1 for later consideration during
war-gaming conducted during Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace Part 4.</span></p>



<p><span>19.11.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Part
2.</b>&nbsp;Analyze the data collected in Part 1 and describe how the factors
affect operations, equipment, and personnel. Whenever possible, use color-coded
stoplight charts that use green, yellow, and red coding to describe aspects of
operations or effects on personnel and equipment. For example, use mission
capable (green), partially mission capable (yellow), or non-mission capable
(red).</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Part
3.</b>&nbsp;Collect historical data and existing intelligence analyses (for
example, Defense Intelligence Agency country reports or Air Force Office of
Special Investigations defense threat assessments of the operating environment,
or other reports about adversaries capable of operating in the geographic area
of concern. Consider the capabilities and weaknesses of each specific group
without assuming that all enemy forces collaborate. Consider and analyze the
effects of the operating environment (gathered in Part 1 and analyzed in Part
2) on each individual adversary.</span></p>

<p><span>19.11.6.4.&nbsp;<b>Part
4.</b>&nbsp;Consider all data collected in the previous three parts and make
logical predictions of enemy course of actions. For each adversary assessed to
be present and capable, establish a prediction of the most likely and most
dangerous enemy course of actions. Then, through a process of war-gaming,
establish friendly courses of action that would effectively meet the
commander's intent in defeating the predicted enemy course of actions.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.12. Integrated Defense Risk Management
Process.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
integrated defense risk management process provides installation commanders,
integrated defense working groups, defense force commanders and defense
planners the ability to produce effects-based, integrated defense plans by
using a standardized model to identify risks and develop risk management
strategies. These strategies leverage finite resources against adaptive threats
to protect Air Force resources and personnel. The integrated defense risk
management process identifies at risk assets and aids the integrated defense
working groups in generating the criticality assessment and the risk assessment<i>&nbsp;</i>products.
A risk reduction decision based on a clear understanding of what is important,
the estimated threat, and how the asset might be damaged/destroyed, is then
developed through a logical process involving asset criticality assessment,
threat assessment, and vulnerability assessment. The integrated defense risk
management process analyzes an installation's defense capabilities and provides
options to mitigate security risks, such as additional tactics, techniques, and
procedures, facility hardening, technology insertion, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.1.
The integrated defense risk management process has four main components: (1) the
risk assessment (as described above); (2) the risk tolerance decision; (3)
courses of action determination; and (4) decision and implementation. All four
components are directly influenced by the evolving situation monitored through
the Intelligence Preparation of the Battlespace cycle. As such, new
information, assessments, or decisions can be assimilated into the integrated
defense risk management process at any point, which may alter the execution of
Integrated Defense. These four components are performed in the following seven
steps:</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Step
1: Develop the Criticality Assessment.</b>&nbsp;The criticality assessment
identifies assets worthy of protection whose loss or damage would have a
negative impact on the mission. Fundamental to this evaluation is the criteria
used to measure asset value or consequence of loss. Typical criteria include
mission criticality, impact on national defense, replace-ability, monetary
value, and relative (or intrinsic) value.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Step
2 and Step 3: Develop the Threat Assessment and Vulnerability Assessment.</b>&nbsp;Threat
multiplied by vulnerability determines the probability of loss (or damage) of
the asset. Threats are generally considered in terms of adversaries and their
tactics (for example, hackers, terrorists, criminals, protestors). To know if
adversaries pose a threat requires information about their operational
capability, intentions, activity, operating environment, and history.
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by an adversary because of
inadequate security, lax or complacent personnel trends, vulnerable software or
hardware, and insufficient security policies or procedures.&nbsp;<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Identification
and evaluation of existing threats and vulnerabilities are identified during
Parts 1 through 3 of the intelligence preparation of the operational
environment process and may be supplemented with other documents, such as
antiterrorism vulnerability assessments.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Step
4: Develop the Risk Assessment.</b>&nbsp;Once all previous assessments
(criticality, threat, and vulnerability) are completed and studied together to
provide a complete picture of the risks to an asset, the risk assessment can be
developed. A quantitative measurement of risk can be determined using the
following equation: risk = asset criticality multiplied by (threat multiplied
by vulnerability).</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.1.4.&nbsp;<b>Step
5: Risk Tolerance Decision.&nbsp;</b>At this point in the integrated defense
risk management process, the commander may have enough data to enable an
informed risk tolerance decision. But if information required to assess risks
is deficient, a command critical intelligence requirement should be developed
or modified to guide the intelligence community's collection efforts. In
today's resource-constrained environment, some risks must be accepted. However,
some risks cannot be tolerated due to their frequency or severity of
consequence. The installation commander's intent for Integrated Defense will
define the level of tolerance. For risks exceeding the commander's tolerance
level, countermeasures will be developed in the next step to render these risks
more acceptable.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.1.5.&nbsp;<b>Step
6: Present Countermeasure Courses of Action.</b>&nbsp;This step presents and
evaluates options for reducing risks. While risks can be alleviated by reducing
the asset's criticality or mitigating the threat, eliminating vulnerabilities
is the area that can have the most impact on the installation commander's risk
tolerance decision. At this time, the integrated defense working group can
develop various countermeasure courses of action to remove or mitigate
vulnerabilities and reduce unacceptable risks. An estimate of risk reduction
(i.e., benefit of risk reduction) can be prepared, along with showing the costs
associated with courses of action implementation.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.1.6.&nbsp;<b>Step
7: Decision and Implementation.</b>&nbsp;This is the most important step in the
integrated defense risk management process. During this step, the installation
commander selects the course of actions that will bring the risks within
his/her tolerance level, and directs resources to implement the decision.
Closely tied with step 7 is continuous assessment. This feedback loop posits
that risk management is not an event or tangible product, but rather a
continuous cycle. The implementation of countermeasure courses of action will
sometimes change the installation's risk posture in unexpected or unintended
ways. By immediately identifying changes to the installation's critical assets,
threats and vulnerabilities, decision makers can continually refine the
installation's risk posture.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.2.
Integrated Defense provides flexible planning and execution opportunities that
allow owners/users of protection level 1 (PL1) non-nuclear, protection level 2
(PL2), protection level 3 (PL3), and protection level 4 (PL4) assets to become
actively involved in the defense of their areas.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.3.
The integrated defense risk management process provides a more precise
understanding of how the three risk factors of threat, vulnerability and asset
criticality relate to each other at each installation. Understanding the
relationships between these factors, as well as continually analyzing the
operating environment, assists commanders in mitigating, accepting, and
reducing risks to appropriate levels.</span></p>

<p><span>19.12.4.
Operationalize force protection intelligence in order to maintain optimal
situational awareness throughout the base boundary and base security zone. This
can be accomplished for the defense force commanders through the development of
a robust intelligence/information collaboration, analysis, and fusion
capability.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.13. Security Protection Levels:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.13.1.&nbsp;<b>Protection Level 1 (PL1).</b></span></p>

<p><span>PL1
is assigned to those resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse,
or compromise would result in unacceptable mission degradation to the strategic
capability of the United States or catastrophic consequences for the nation.
Examples of PL1 resources are nuclear weapons in storage, mated to a delivery
system, or in transit; designated command, control, and communications
facilities; and aircraft designated to transport the President of the United
States. PL1 security must result in the greatest possible deterrence against
hostile acts. This level of security will provide maximum means to detect and
defeat a hostile force before it is able to seize, damage, or destroy
resources.</span></p>

<p><span>19.13.2.&nbsp;<b>Protection Level 2 (PL2).</b></span></p>

<p><span>PL2
is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or
compromise would result in significant mission degradation to the war fighting
capability of the United States. Examples of PL2 resources are nonnuclear alert
forces; designated space and launch systems; expensive, few in number, or
one-of-a-kind systems or facilities; and intelligence-gathering systems. PL2
security must result in significant deterrence against hostile acts. This level
of security will ensure a significant probability of detecting and defeating a
hostile force before PL2 is able to seize, damage, or destroy resources.</span></p>

<p><span>19.13.3.&nbsp;<b>Protection Level 3 (PL3).</b></span></p>

<p><span>PL3
is assigned to resources for which the loss, theft, destruction, misuse, or
compromise would result in mission degradation to the United States warfighting
capability. Examples of PL3 resources are non-alert resources that can be
generated to alert status, such as F-16 fighters; selected command, control,
and communications facilities, systems, and equipment; and non-launch-critical
or non-unique space launch systems. PL3 security must result in a reasonable
degree of deterrence against hostile acts. This level of security ensures the
capability to impede a hostile force and limit damage to resources.</span></p>

<p><span>19.13.4.&nbsp;<b>Protection Level 4 (PL4).</b></span></p>

<p><span>PL4 is assigned to
operational or mission support resources that directly or indirectly support
power projection assess and the war fighting mission for which the loss, theft,
destruction, misuse, or compromise would adversely affect mission capability.
Examples of PL4 resources are facilities storing Category I, II, or III
sensitive conventional arms, ammunition, and explosives; fuels and liquid
oxygen storage areas; and Air Force accounting and finance vault areas. PL4
resources are secured by containing them in controlled areas with owners/users
being responsible for security. Security forces provide response to threats.
This level of security must reduce the opportunity for theft of or damage to
resources.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section
19D Antiterrorism Program</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>19.14. Air Force Antiterrorism Program Defined.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The program seeks to deter or limit the effects
of terrorist acts against the Air Force by giving guidance on collecting and disseminating
timely threat information, providing training to all Air Force members,
developing comprehensive plans to deter and counter terrorist incidents,
allocating funds and personnel, and implementing antiterrorism measures.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.15. Antiterrorism Training and Exercises.</span></b></p>

<p><span>At
least annually, commanders conduct comprehensive field and staff training to
exercise antiterrorism plans, to include antiterrorism physical security
measures, Continuity of Operations Program, Critical Asset Risk Management and emergency
management plans. Antiterrorism training and exercises shall be afforded the
same emphasis as combat task training and executed with the intent to identify
shortfalls affecting the protection of personnel, assets and information
against terrorist attack and subsequent antiterrorism consequence management
efforts. Antiterrorism, an area of responsibility specific training,
particularly pre-deployment training, should include terrorism scenarios
specific to the deployed location and based on current enemy Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures, and lessons learned. Additionally, the current
baseline through force protection condition Charlie measures shall be exercised
annually at installations and selfsupported<b>&nbsp;</b>separate facilities.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.16. Threat Information Collection and
Analysis:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.16.1.
Commanders shall task the appropriate organizations under their command to
gather, analyze, and disseminate terrorism threat information, as appropriate.
To support the commander, the Services should continuously ensure forces are
trained to maximize the use of information derived from law enforcement
liaison, intelligence, and counterintelligence processes and procedures. This
includes intelligence procedures for handling priority intelligence requests
for in-transit units as well as implementation of procedures to conduct
intelligence preparation of the space and mission analysis.</span></p>

<p><span>19.16.2. Identifying the
potential terrorism threat to Department of Defense personnel and assets and
how the hazards affect the mission is the first step in developing an effective
antiterrorism program. Commanders at all levels who understand the threat can
assess their ability to prevent, survive, and prepare to respond to an attack.
A terrorism threat assessment requires the identification of a full range of
known or estimated terrorist threat capabilities (including the use or threat
of use of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-yield explosives
and weapons of mass destruction). In addition to tasking appropriate agencies
to collect information, commanders at all levels can and should encourage
personnel under their command to report information on individuals, events, or
situations that could pose a threat to the security of Department of Defense
personnel, families, facilities, and resources.</span></p>

<p><span>19.16.3.
At the strategic level, the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance (Air Force/A2) and the Director for
Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Strategy, Doctrine and Force
Development (Air Force/A2D)<b>&nbsp;</b>is responsible for ensuring the timely
collection processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of foreign
intelligence, current intelligence, and national-level intelligence information
concerning terrorist activities, terrorist organizations, and force protection
issues. These efforts will focus on, but not be limited to, transnational and
statesponsored entities and organizations. The Air Force Office of Special
Investigations is the lead Air Force agency for collection, investigation,
analysis, and response for threats arising from terrorists, criminal activity
and foreign intelligence and security services. Air Force Office of Special
Investigations is primarily focused on countering adversary intelligence
collection activities against United States forces and will act as the Air
Force single point of contact with federal, state, local and foreign nation law
enforcement, counterintelligence, and security agencies.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.17.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Department of Defense Random Antiterrorism Measures
Program.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Installation
commanders shall develop and implement a random antiterrorism measures program
that will include all units on the installation. The intent of the random
antiterrorism measures program is to provide random, multiple security measures
that consistently change the look of an installation's antiterrorism program.
Random antiterrorism measures introduce uncertainty to an installation s
overall force protection program to defeat surveillance attempts and make
random antiterrorism measures difficult for a terrorist to accurately predict
our actions. The random antiterrorism measures program shall be included in
antiterrorism plans and tie directly with all force protection condition
(including force protection condition normal) to ensure continuity and
standardization should threats require Air Force-wide implementation. Random
antiterrorism measures times for implementation, location, and duration shall
be regularly changed to avoid predictability. Random antiterrorism measures
execution shall be broad based and involve all units and personnel.
Antiterrorism officers are required to monitor, track, and analyze random
antiterrorism measures implementation efforts. Installation commanders will
develop procedures to ensure random antiterrorism measures are being conducted
and reported to the Antiterrorism officers.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.18. General Antiterrorism Personal
Protection.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Always keep a low
profile and avoid publicity. Avoid going out in large groups; be unpredictable.
Vary daily routines to and from home and work. Be alert for anything suspicious
or out of place. Avoid giving unnecessary personal details to anyone unless
their identity can be verified. Be alert to strangers who are on government
property for no apparent reason. Refuse to meet with strangers outside your
workplace. Always advise associates or family members of your destination and
anticipated time of arrival when leaving the office or home. Report unsolicited
contacts to authorities and do not open doors to strangers. Memorize key
telephone numbers. Be cautious about giving out information regarding family
travel places or security measures. When overseas, learn and practice a few key
phrases in the local language.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.19. Home and Family Security.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Your
spouses and children should always practice basic precautions for their
personal security. Familiarize your family with the local terrorist threat, and
regularly review protective measures and techniques. Ensure everyone in the
family knows what to do in any type of emergency. Restrict the possession of house
keys. Lock all entrances at night, including the garage. Keep the house locked,
even if you are at home. Destroy all envelopes or other items that show your
name, rank, or other personal information. Remove names and rank from
mailboxes. Watch for unfamiliar vehicles cruising or parked frequently in the
area, particularly if one or more occupants remain in the vehicle for extended
periods.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.20. Telephone Security.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Post emergency telephone numbers on the telephone and preprogram
telephone numbers for security forces, local police, fire department,
hospitals, and ambulances. Do not answer your telephone with your name and
grade. Report all threatening phone calls to security officials and the
telephone company. Attempt to ascertain any pertinent information about the
caller.</span></p>

<p><span>For example, background
noise, accent, nationality, or location.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.21. Travel Overseas.</span></b></p>

<p><span>When
traveling overseas, travel in small groups and try to be inconspicuous when
using public transportation and facilities. Dress, conduct, and mannerisms
should not attract attention and be generally similar to that worn by the
people in the area. Avoid spontaneous gatherings or demonstrations; stay away
from known trouble. Know emergency telephone numbers, local dialing
instructions, and ensure family members carry a list of telephone numbers with
them at all times.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.22. Suspicious Packages or Mail.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Look
for an unusual or unknown place of origin; no return address; excessive amount
of postage; abnormal size or shape; protruding strings; aluminum foil; wires;
misspelled words; differing return address and postmark; handwritten labels;
unusual odor; unusual or unbalanced weight; springiness in the top or bottom;
inflexibility; crease marks; discoloration or oily stains; incorrect titles or
title with no name; excessive security material; ticking, beeping, or other
sounds; or special instruction markings, such as  personal, rush, do not delay,
or confidential  on any packages or mail received. Additionally, be vigilant
for evidence of powder or other contaminants. Never cut tape, strings, or other
wrappings on a suspect package. If the package has been moved, place the
package in a plastic bag to prevent any leakage of contents. If handling mail
suspected of containing chemical or biological contaminants, wash hands
thoroughly with soap and water. Report suspicious mail immediately and make a
list of personnel who were in the room when the suspicious envelope or package
was identified.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.23. Ground Transportation Security.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Criminal
and terrorist acts against individuals usually occur outside the home and after
the victim's habits have been established. Your most predictable habit is the
route you travel from home to your place of duty or to commonly frequented
local facilities. Always check for tampering of the interior and exterior of
your vehicle before entering the vehicle. Also check the tires and trunk for
fingerprints or smudges. If you detect something out of the ordinary, do not
touch anything. Immediately contact the local authorities. When overseas,
select a plain car. Avoid using government vehicles when possible. Do not
display decals with military affiliations and do not openly display military
equipment. Keep your doors locked at all times. Do not let someone you do not
know direct you to a specific taxi. Ensure taxi is licensed and has safety
equipment (seat belts at a minimum). Ensure face of driver and picture on
license are the same. Travel with a companion.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.24. Commercial Air Transportation Security
Overseas.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Before
traveling overseas, consult the Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide
Department of Defense 4500.54M, available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/"><span>fcg.pentagon.mil</span></a><a href="https://www.fcg.pentagon.mil/"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>to ensure you know and can meet all requirements
for travel to a particular country. Get an area of responsibility specific
threat briefing from your security officer, antiterrorism officers, or the
appropriate counterintelligence or security organization prior to traveling
overseas. This briefing is required prior to travel overseas and must occur
within 3 months of travel. Use office symbols on orders or leave authorization
if the word description denotes a sensitive position. Use military contractor
United States flag carriers. Avoid traveling through high-risk areas. Do not
use rank or military address on tickets. Do not discuss military affiliation.
Have proper identification to show airline and immigration officials. Do not
carry classified documents unless absolutely mission essential. Dress
conservatively; do not wear distinct military items (wear long-sleeved shirts
if you have United States-affiliated tattoos). Carry plain civilian luggage;
avoid military-looking bags, or bags with logos or decals.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.25. Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Human
Intelligence is a category of intelligence derived from information collected
and provided by human sources. Human resources intelligence is also called
Human Intelligence and is the intelligence derived from the intelligence
collection discipline that uses human beings as both source and collectors, and
where the human being is the primary collection instrument. Counterintelligence<b>&nbsp;</b>is
information gathered and activities conducted to protect against espionage,
other intelligence activities, sabotage, or assassinations conducted by or on
behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign organizations or
foreign persons, or international terrorist activities.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.1.<b>&nbsp;Threat Areas:</b></span></p>

<p><span>19.25.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Espionage.&nbsp;</b>The
act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving
information about national defense with intent or reason to believe the
information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage
of any foreign nation.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.1.2.&nbsp;<b>Subversion.&nbsp;</b>An
act or acts inciting military or civilian personnel of the Department of
Defense to violate laws, disobey lawful orders or regulations, or disrupt
military activities with the willful intent thereby to interfere with, or
impair the loyalty, morale, of discipline, of the Military Forces of the United
States.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Sabotage.&nbsp;</b>An<b>&nbsp;</b>act
or acts with intent to injure, interfere with, or obstruct the national defense
of a country by willfully injuring or destroying, or attempting to injure or
destroy, any national defense or war material, premises, or utilities, to
include human and natural resources.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.1.4.&nbsp;<b>Terrorism.&nbsp;</b>The
calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate
fear; intended to coerce or intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit
of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.2.<b>&nbsp;The Human Intelligence Effort:</b></span></p>

<p><span>19.25.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Interrogation.&nbsp;</b>Interrogation
is the systematic effort to procure information to answer specific collection
requirements by direct and indirect questioning techniques of a person who is
in the custody of the forces conducting the questioning. Proper questioning of
enemy combatants, enemy prisoners of war, or other detainees by trained and
certified Department of Defense interrogators may result in information
provided either willingly or unwittingly.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Source
Operations.&nbsp;</b>Designated and fully trained military Human Intelligence
collection personnel may develop information through the elicitation of
sources, to include:  walk-in  sources, who without solicitation make the first
contact with Human Intelligence personnel; developed sources that are met over
a period of time and provide information, based on operational requirements;
unwitting persons, with access to sensitive information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Debriefing.&nbsp;</b>Debriefing
is the process of questioning cooperating human sources to satisfy intelligence
requirements, consistent with applicable law. The source usually is not in
custody and usually is willing to cooperate. Debriefing may be conducted at all
echelons and in all operational environments. Through debriefing, face-to-face
meetings, conversations, and elicitation, information may be obtained from a
variety of human sources.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Document
and Media Exploitation.&nbsp;</b>Captured documents and media, when properly
processed and exploited, may provide valuable information such as adversary
plans and intentions, force locations, equipment capabilities, and logistical
status. The category of  captured documents and media  includes all media
capable of storing fixed information to include computer storage material. This
operation is not a primary Human Intelligence function but may be conducted by
any intelligence personnel with appropriate language support.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.3.<b>&nbsp;Incident Reporting.</b></span></p>

<p><span>AFI
71-101, Volume 4,&nbsp;<i>Counterintelligence,</i>&nbsp;requires individuals
who have reportable contacts or acquire reportable information to immediately
(within 30 days of the contact) report the contact or information, either
verbally or in writing, to Air Force Office of Special Investigations.
 Contact  means any exchange of information directed to an individual,
including solicited or unsolicited telephone calls, email, radio contact, and
face-to-face meetings. Examples include:</span></p>

indicating military members, civilian employees, or Department of Defense
contractors have contemplated, attempted, or effected the deliberate compromise
or unauthorized release of classified or unclassified controlled information.</span></p>

<p><span>19.25.4.&nbsp;<b>Air Force Office of Special
Investigations Responsibility.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The Air Force Office of Special Investigations initiates and
conducts all counterintelligence investigations, operations, collections, and
other related activities for the Air Force. In the United States, the Air Force
Office of Special Investigations coordinates these activities when appropriate
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></p>

<p><span>Outside
the United States, Air Force Office of Special Investigations coordinates these
activities with the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, as appropriate. The Air Force Office of Special Investigations
is also the installation-level training agency for counterintelligence
awareness briefings and is the sole Air Force repository for the collection and
retention of reportable information.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.26. Protection of the President and Others:</span></b></p>

<p><span>19.26.1.
As a result of a formal agreement between the Department of Defense and United
States Secret Service, individuals affiliated with the Armed Services have a
special obligation to report information to the Secret Service pertaining to
the protection of the President of the United States. This obligation is
specified in AFI 71-101, Volume 2,&nbsp;<i>Protective Service Matters.</i></span></p>

<p><span>19.26.2. Air Force
members and civilian employees must notify their commanders, supervisors, or
the Air Force Office of</span></p>

<p><span>Special Investigations
of information concerning the safety of anyone under the protection of the
United States Secret Service. This includes the President and Vice President,
the President- and Vice President-elect, and visiting heads of foreign states
or foreign governments. Additionally former United States Presidents and their
spouses for their lifetimes, except that protection of a spouse shall terminate
in the event of remarriage unless the former President did not serve as
President prior to January 1, 1997, in which case, former Presidents and their
spouses for a period of not more than ten years from the date a former
President leaves office. The type of information to report includes:</span></p>

<p><span>19.26.2.1.
Threats, incidents, or demonstrations against foreign diplomatic missions
(embassies, chanceries, consulates) in the United States or territories of the
United States and the use or attempted use of bodily harm, assassination, or
kidnapping as a political weapon.</span></p>

<p><span>19.26.2.2. Civil
disturbances which may require the use of Federalized National Guard or United
States military personnel to maintain or restore public order.</span></p>

<p><span>19.26.2.3.
United States citizens or residents who have renounced or indicated a desire to
renounce the United States government and who are characterized by emotional
instability, violent anti-United States sentiment, or a propensity toward
violence. Others who should be reported are military members or civilian
employees of the Armed Forces being separated or discharged or retired who are
deemed a threat by a competent authority (installation or hospital commander).</span></p>

<p><span>19.26.3.
The Air Force Office of Special Investigations is the point of contact between
the Air Force and the United States Secret Service. Any information of interest
to the United States Secret Service that comes to the attention of Air Force
commanders and supervisors must be reported to the nearest Air Force Office of
Special Investigations unit as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><b><span>19.27. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Security
responsibility applies to all members of the Air Force at all times. This
chapter covered information assurance, installation security, and force
protection. These topics are essential to the Air Force mission and to the
security of all its resources. All Air Force members must be versed in security
principles, apply them to all aspects of their work, and be conscious of how it
affects their personal lives. Proper security measures directly contribute to
Air Force readiness.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 20A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>20.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Air
Force knowledge is important because it provides the framework of information
required to understand the basic infrastructure of the Air Force such as weapon
systems, vocabulary, and some Air Force heritage. In these few pages, you will
find a small sampling of the knowledge you will need to be a successful Airman.
I encourage you to study the priceless information contained in these pages as
well as other sources such as the Air University&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-ldr.htm"><span>(</span></a><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-ldr.htm"><span>http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc</span></a><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-ldr.htm"><span>-</span></a><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-ldr.htm"><span>ldr.htm</span></a><a href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/awc-ldr.htm"><span>)</span></a><span>. Understanding this Air Force knowledge will
give you the power to unleash the Airman inside you, live a career of success,
and leave a lasting legacy for future generations to follow.&nbsp;<b><i>Section

<p><b><span>20.2. Tail Flashes.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
majority of major commands require assigned aircraft to hold identifiers as
depicted in Technical Order 1-1-8,&nbsp;<i>Application and Removal of Organic
Coatings, Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment</i>. The composite listing of
unit identifiers are identified in Table 20.1., and show past and current Air
Force aircraft tail unit identifiers.&nbsp;<b>Table 20.1. Tail Flashes Unit

<p><b><span>20.3 - Mission Design Series (MDS).</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
MDS designator is an official Department of Defense recognized alpha-numeric
symbol designation of a military defense aerospace vehicle. A standardized set
of symbols, established by the Secretary of Defense, are used for solely
designating military defense aerospace vehicles categorized as: aircraft
(standard or non-standard), guided missiles, rockets, probes, boosters, and
satellites. The designator describes the aerospace vehicle in two components
where the components are separated by a dash. The first component, comprised
only of alpha characters, describes the mission of the vehicle. The second
component, comprised of both alpha-numeric characters, describes the design
number and design series of the vehicle.</span></p>

<p><b><span>20.4. Current Weapon Systems, Space Systems, and
Missile and Munition Systems.</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Airpower</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>is  the ability
to project military power or influence through the control and exploitation of
air, space, and cyberspace to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical
objectives. &nbsp;</b>The proper application of airpower requires a
comprehensive doctrine of employment and an Airman's perspective. As the
nation's most comprehensive provider of military airpower, the Air Force
conducts continuous and concurrent air, space, and cyberspace operations. The
air, space, and cyberspace capabilities of the other Services serve primarily
to support their organic maneuver paradigms; the Air Force employs air, space,
and cyberspace capabilities with a broader focus on theater-wide and
national-level objectives. Through airpower, the Air Force provides the
versatile, wide-ranging means towards achieving national objectives with the
ability to deter and respond immediately to crises anywhere in the world.</span></p>

<p><b><span>20.11. Total Force.</span></b></p>

<p><span>20.11.1. American Airmen
from each component   Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force
Reserve   provide seamless airpower on a global scale every day. Over the past
two decades, to meet combatant commander requirements and the demands of
recurring deployments, the Air Force has increasingly called upon its Total
Force. This elevated use of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve has
transformed a traditionally strategic reserve force into a force that provides
operational capability, strategic depth, and surge capacity.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.2. In Total Force
Integration associations, the Active and Reserve Components share equipment,
facilities and resources, including aircraft, crews and maintenance, to carry
out a common mission. In a classic association, the Active Component is the
host unit, retaining weapon system responsibility, while sharing the mission
with a Reserve or Guard tenant unit. For active associations the Reserve or
Guard unit is host, with an Active Component tenant. Integrating with the
Active Component in this way yields numerous synergistic benefits to the Air
Force's strength, including an improved ability to respond with surge capacity
at a moment's notice.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.&nbsp;<b>Air National Guard.</b></span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.1. The heritage
predates the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate armed
service in 1947: it shares a community-based militia tradition with the Army
National Guard that dates from colonial times.</span></p>

<p><span>State National Guards
began forming aviation units as early as 1908, and New York's 1st Aero Company
was the first such organization mustered into federal service in 1916.
Mobilization for World War I dissolved these state units, although many Guard
personnel served in the Army Air Service. With the reorganization of the Army
in 1920, the National Guard gained organic aviation units with federal
standing. Twenty-nine observation squadrons had activated by the time the
United States entered World War II, all absorbed into the Army Air Forces upon
mobilization.</span></p>



<p><span>20.11.3.2. After federal
service in the war, these 29 units became the core of the new Air National
Guard, together with 43 more flying squadrons added to the Air National Guard
after 1947. In keeping with the National Guard's previous legal status, and in
contrast to the Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard retained a dual role:
each state's Air National Guard units remained at the governors' disposal when
not called into federal service. In either status, the federal government
provided the bulk of the Air Guard's funding. Initially, the Air National
Guard's nominal mission was as a short-range, daytime air defense force. In
this role, the bulk of the Air National Guard's aircraft were F-47 Thunderbolt
and F-51 Mustangs left over from World War II, plus a few light bombers, B-26
Invaders. A small number of early jet fighters soon supplemented the initial
propeller-driven force.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.3. The Air Guard
received its baptism by fire during the Korean War. Sixty-seven flying
squadrons and approximately 45,000 Air National Guard members, some 80 percent
of the force, were mobilized. Mobilization was complicated: some units took
three to six months to become combat ready, and some never did. The Air
National Guard still formed a substantial part of the wartime Air Force, with
some units serving in combat, while others relieved deploying regular squadrons
at home.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.4. Based on
Korean War experience, senior Air National Guard and Air Force leaders
committed to build the Air National Guard into a more effective force, and the
Air National Guard received modern equipment and better funding to that end. These
efforts came to fruition when President John F. Kennedy mobilized over 21,000
Air National Guard members from 28 squadrons in 1961 as part of the United
States response to the Berlin Crisis. The Air National Guard deployed 216 Air
National Guard fighter aircraft with support personnel to Europe to reinforce
North Atlantic Treaty organization. This movement, Operation Stair Step, was
the largest aircraft deployment in Air National Guard history. The entire
deployment across the Atlantic Ocean occurred without the loss of a single
plane.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.5. The war in
Vietnam saw a few Air National Guard fighter squadrons deployed, and the Air
Guard supplied some of the airlift into the theater. The Air Guard's main role,
however, was support for the Air Force's commitments in Europe as the demands
of operations in Southeast Asia taxed the regular force. The Air National Guard
assumed aerial refueling responsibilities for Air Force fighters in Europe from
1967 to 1977. This effort, Operation Creek Party, demonstrated that the Air
Guard could provide sustained support to the Air Force without resorting to
mobilization by rotating forces of volunteer personnel operating aircraft drawn
from Air National Guard squadrons. This approach remains virtually unchanged
today.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.6. After the
Vietnam War, some significant missions moved to the Air National Guard. Air
Guard KC-135 air refueling tankers began participating in the Strategic Air
Command's nuclear alert force in 1976. In 1977, the Air National Guard became
the primary airlifters for United States Southern Command's Operation Coronet
Oak, which continues today. From 1978 to 1990, rotating Air National Guard
fighter squadrons assumed responsibility for the air defense of the Panama
Canal Zone under Operation Coronet Cove. The Air National Guard participated in
Operation Just Cause, the 1989 invasion of Panama to expel its dictator, Manuel
Noriega, and to install a democratically elected president. In the 1990s, Air
Guardsmen manned radar stations and flew fighter aircraft in Latin America to
monitor and report suspected drug-running aircraft. This operational experience
served the Air Guard well in the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990-1991. Air National
Guard fighters, tankers, airlifters, special operations, aeromedical
evacuation, and security forces participated in the air campaign of the Persian
Gulf War. During that time, 12,404 Air National Guard members were mobilized
and deployed to Southwest Asia, Europe and other overseas locations as well as
serving in the continental United States.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.7. Following the
Persian Gulf War and the end of the Cold War, the Air National Guard continued
to operate world-wide, integrated with the Regular Air Force and the Air Force
Reserve, jointly with the other services, and combined with North Atlantic
Treaty Organization forces. The Air National Guard participated in several
major operations involving humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, and direct
combat action. Some operations were extensions of those that involved the Air National
Guard earlier in South America, but through the 1990s the Air National Guard
gained more commitments, Bolstered by new capabilities, Air Guard flying and
support units helped maintain the no-fly zones over Iraq, provided humanitarian
assistance in Somalia and Rwanda, and supported peacekeeping forces in the
Balkans and Haiti. The Air Force's global mobility operations involved Air
National Guard tanker and airlift forces on a daily basis. In 1997, the Air
National Guard assumed responsibility for manning First Air Force, which
maintained the air defenses of the continental United States. President Bill
Clinton also mobilized 4,870 Air Guardsmen during the Kosovo War in 1999.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.8.
The Air National Guard played a critical role in the immediate United States
response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent
global military actions. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Air National
Guard improvised a greatly strengthened continental air defense system and bore
the main burden of sustaining it. The combination of fighter patrols and
24-hour alerts at 26 Air National Guard bases across the</span></p>

<p><span>United States put heavy
stress on the Air National Guard fighter force in both training and readiness,
but the wide geographic dispersal of its fighter units and its long standing
role in continental air defense made the Air National Guard the right
organization to execute the mission.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.3.9. The Air
National Guard's aviation and support units also played critical roles in the
wars in</span></p>

<p><span>Afghanistan
(Operation Enduring Freedom) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom). Flying and
non-flying Air National Guard units deployed repeatedly to every operating base
supporting those wars. When Operation</span></p>

<p><span>Enduring Freedom began 7
October 2001, the Air National Guard participated in the initial combat
operations in Afghanistan and have continued to participate in the mission ever
since. Air National Guard airlift, tankers, A-10 and F-16 units, special
operations, rescue, civil engineer, security forces, combat communication and
many other units have repeatedly deployed to the region over the course of that
war. When the United States invaded Iraq on 20 March 2003, the Air National
Guard had 18,552 members on Regualr Air Force participating in the invasion and
serving in Afghanistan and other overseas operations. The six Air National
Guard A-10 units participated in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan
simultaneously. During the invasion of Iraq, the only A-10 presence in
Afghanistan was an Air National Guard unit. Air Guard F-16C Block 30 fighters
and a few A-10s equipped with Litening 2 targeting pods   a capability
developed independently by the Air National Guard - provided air support for
special operations units operating in the western desert of Iraq looking for
SCUD missiles. In addition, Air National Guard F-16C Block 30 aircraft provided
a unique capability as the last United States aircraft equipped with Theater
Airborne Reconnaissance System pods. Intelligence Surveillance and
Reconnaissance in general was a growing capability for deployed Air National
Guard forces with the proliferation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft systems like
the Predator.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.&nbsp;<b>Air Force Reserve.</b></span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.1. Since formal
establishment of the Air Force Reserve in April 1948, the Air Force Reserve has
amassed a rich heritage with heroic accounts of responding to natural
disasters, humanitarian crisis, and combat operations.</span></p>

<p><span>Our history is also a
study of changing, adapting, and evolving from a strategic force held in
 reserve  into an operational Reserve force with the most advanced weapons
systems.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.2. Today,
Citizen Airmen perform leading roles in military operations, humanitarian
crisis and disaster relief around the globe. The Air Force Reserve consists of
officers, enlisted and civil servants who are tasked by law to fill the needs
of the armed forces whenever more units and people are required than are
available within the Regular Air Force. More than 860,000 people make up the
Ready, Standby, Retired and Regualr Air Force Retired Reserve. This includes
nearly 70,000 Selected Reservists who are  ready-now  participating in every
job specialty and on the front lines of daily military operations around the
globe. The Air Force Reserve is a combatready force of Citizen Airmen,
stationed locally at over 60 locations throughout the United States and serving
globally for every Combatant Command in air, space and cyberspace.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.3.
The Chief of Air Force Reserve, Headquarters Air Force, Pentagon, serves as the
principal advisor on reserve matters to the Secretary of the Air Force and Air
Force Chief of Staff. The Chief of Air Force Reserve is also dual-hatted as the
Commander of Air Force Reserve Command, located at Robins Air Force Base,
Georgia. The Commander of Air Force Reserve Command is responsible for
organizing, training, and equipping all Air</span></p>

<p><span>Force Reserve units. Air
Force Reserve Command is composed of three Numbered Air Forces, a Force
Generation Center, the Air Reserve Personnel center, 35 flying wings, 1 space wing,
1 Special Operations Wing, 11 flying groups, and 4 independent groups.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.4. Circa 1917:
The National Defense Act of 1916 directed the creation of an Officers Reserve
Corps, an Enlisted Reserve Corps and the nation's Air Service Reserve Program.
For the first time, Reserve Corps were clearly a federal reserve force and not
militia. The Reserve Corps were established on March 22, 1917, just weeks
before the United States formally entered World War I. By the end of the war,
more than 11,000 of Army Air Service pilots who fought were reserve officers.
Notably, the First Reserve Aero Squadron deployed in the summer of 1917 for
action in France. Later, the squadron went on to fight in the Pacific Theater
in World War II, served at the forefront of the nuclear deterrence mission in
the Cold War, and, still serving today as the 26th Space Aggressor Squadron, is
the oldest squadron in the Air Force Reserve.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.5. 1941:
Reservists played a critical role in World War II. In the war's early days
1,500 reserve pilots along with 1,300 non-rated officers and 400 enlisted
Airmen were activated into the Army Air Corps. These included the legendary
Jimmy Doolittle who was ordered to Regualr Air Force to work in Detroit to
convert automobile manufacturing plants into aircraft factories and later went
on to lead  Doolittle's Raiders,  the first American bombing attack on the
Japanese mainland.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.6. 1948: In a
joint directive signed by General Omar Bradley, the Army Chief of Staff, and
General Carl Spaatz, the Air Force Chief of Staff, dated April 14, 1948 the
Army Air Corps Reserve was transferred to the Air Force officially becoming the
Air Force Reserve.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.7. 1950: The
young Air Force Reserve was barely two years old when it mobilized nearly
147,000 reservists, many who were World War II veterans, for the Korean War
from 1950 to 1953. The Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 refined the use of the
Reserve Components in time of war or national emergency and established three
levels of Air Force reservists   ready, standby, and retired.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.8. 1960 s: In
1961, President John F. Kennedy called up the Air Force Reserve in response to
the Berlin crisis. The mobilization included five Air Force Reserve C-124
aircraft units and 5,613 reservists. By 1962, an additional mobilization of
14,220 reservists and 422 aircraft were supporting operations during the Cuban
Missile Crisis. Most experts believe that the mobilization had the effect of
deterring war. Beginning in the early 1960s, the Air Force Reserve provided
strategic airlift as well as counterinsurgency, close air support, tactical
mobility, interdiction, rescue and recovery, intelligence, medical,
maintenance, aerial port and air superiority until the United States ended its
involvement in the Vietnam War.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.9. 1970 s: In
August 1970, the Department of Defense implemented the Total Force Policy and
the Air</span></p>

<p><span>Force Reserve became a
multi-mission force flying the same modern aircraft as the active Air Force. In
March 1973, Air Force Reserve C-141 and C-9 associate aircrews, medical,
aeromedical, casualty assistance, legal, chaplain, and intelligence personnel
supported Operation Homecoming the return of the American prisoners of war from
North Vietnam. That same year, the Air Force Reserve proved the concept of
Global Mobility by flying hundreds of strategic airlift missions during the
Arab-Israeli War.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.10. 1980 s: For
the most part, the nation was at peace for the next few years with the Air
Force Reserve periodically engaged in emergency-response and humanitarian
missions. This included the rescue and return of more than 700 American
students from Grenada and evacuation of wounded Marines from Lebanon in 1983,
the aerial-refueling of F-111 aircraft during the El Dorado Canyon raid on
Libyan-sponsored terrorists in 1986, and Operation Just Cause that ousted
Panama's General Noriega in 1989-1990.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.11. 1990 s:
Nearly 23,500 Air Force Reservists were mobilized, and 15,000 volunteered for
service in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, in response to
Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. This began more than twenty years
of continuous combat operations in Southwest Asia, while simultaneously
conducting numerous emergency-response and humanitarian missions. These
included combat operations over Bosnia, Serbia, and Kosovo, and Haiti as well
as the evacuation of Clark Air Force Base during the eruption of Mount
Pinatubo, and significant contributions to disaster relief operations in former
Soviet republics, southern Turkey and northern Iraq, Somalia, and Haiti.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.12.
2001: When terrorists attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, Air Force
reservists responded in full measure. Air Force Reserve F-16 fighter aircraft
flew combat air patrols to protect American cities while&nbsp; KC-135
tankers and Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft supported security
efforts. In October 2001, Operation Enduring Freedom began as United States
military forces entered Afghanistan to combat the Taliban and eliminate
terrorist sanctuaries. In March 2003, Operation Iraqi Freedom began in order to
end Saddam Hussein's regime. Air Force Reserve units and reservists played key
roles in all combat operations as Air Force Reserve MC-130 Combat Talon
aircraft became the first fixed-wing aircraft to penetrate Afghan airspace
while</span></p>

<p><span>Air Force Reserve F-16
crews performed the first combat missions. In 2004, more than 140 Air Force
Reserve Combat Convoy Airmen served in the 1059th Air Expeditionary Force Truck
Company. Air Force Reserve Security Forces served throughout Iraq and
Afghanistan, and comprised the entire Security Force presence at Kirkuk Air
Base with as many as 275 personnel. Air Force Reserve Explosive Ordnance
Disposal provided extensive mission support in Iraq and Afghanistan by executing
a broad scope of missions within and beyond the base security zone. Air Force
Reserve Expeditionary Combat Support capabilities provided airfield operations,
cargo and passenger handling, medical, security, intelligence, and personnel
services.</span></p>

<p><span>20.11.4.13. Today and in
recent years, Citizen Airmen have supported every Air Force core function and
every</span></p>

<p><span>Combatant Commander
around the world. Air Force reservists were engaged in surge operations in Iraq
and</span></p>

<p><span>Afghanistan. They
supported combat and humanitarian missions in Haiti, Libya, Japan, Mali and the
Horn of Africa. Also, they ve provided national disaster relief at home in the
United States after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the gulf oil spill and the
wildfires in the western states. Throughout our history, Citizen Airmen have
continually volunteered, allaying concerns that reservists would not be
available when really needed. Since its inception, the Air Force Reserve
evolved from an individual-mobilization-only force into an operational reserve
that participates daily in missions around the globe. Today, Air Force
reservists safeguard nuclear weapons and guide Global Positioning Satellites.
From bases in the United States, reservists fly remotely piloted aircraft in
combat half a world away. They track hurricanes out at sea and bring medical
supplies and food into disaster areas to save lives around the world. Spanning
six and a half decades   with the last two decades of continuous combat   the
Air Force Reserve has fulfilled the legacy of early air pioneers and exceeded
the potential seen by the visionaries who created it. For more information on
the history of the Air Force Reserve, go to:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.afrc.af.mil/library/history/"><span>www.afrc.af.mil/library/history/</span></a><a href="http://www.afrc.af.mil/library/history/"><span>.</span></a></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section
21B Organizational Design</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>21.2. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>What do you think of
when you hear the term Organizational Design? Do you think of your
organizational chart? Most people do, but that is only a portion of your
organization's design. Organizational design is the process of selecting a
formal system of communication, coordination, controls, authority, and assigned
responsibilities necessary to achieve the organization's goals. As leaders, we
need to understand how to select appropriate organizational designs that
facilitate mission accomplishment. To this end, this reading will address how
effective organizational design not only facilitates mission accomplishment but
also enhances productivity of an organization. First, we will discuss factors
leaders should consider when designing their organizations. Then, we will look
at four organizational systems or designs, and discuss the organizational
factors which determine which design is most appropriate for a given
organization. Before we can talk about the different designs, we need to look
at what influences or factors affect our design choice.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.3. Design Factors:</span></b></p>

<p><span>21.3.1.
There are many factors that<b>&nbsp;</b>influence how we set<b>&nbsp;</b>up our
organizations. The first is&nbsp;<b>organizational strategy (goals).&nbsp;</b>Professor
of Organizational Behavior Dr. Stephen Robbins states, "An organization's
strategy<b>&nbsp;</b>is a means to help management achieve its objectives.
Since objectives are derived from the organization's overall strategy,<b>&nbsp;</b>it
is only logical that strategy and structure should be linked. More
specifically, structure should follow strategy." (Robbins: 569) What Dr.
Robbins suggestsis we<b>&nbsp;</b>need to identify why we<b>&nbsp;</b>are doing
what we are doing, how we expect<b>&nbsp;</b>to get there (strategy), and then
design our organizations to accomplish that strategy. Why does your
organization exist?<b>&nbsp;</b>What are your goals?<b>&nbsp;</b>Does your
mission require creativity or control? Do you need to be effective or
efficient? Answers to these questions give us a starting point in determining
which design the organization should use. Nevertheless, we must consider a few
other factors.</span></p>

<p><span>21.3.2.
Another design factor is the&nbsp;<b>environment.</b>&nbsp;When we speak of the
environment, we are not talking about the climate or the physical environment.
We are talking about what outside forces affect the organization's processes.
Are we dependent on other organizations or sections to do our jobs? Is the
environment constantly in a state of flux? Are we continually changing or do we
do the same processes repeatedly? Professor Richard Daft, author of&nbsp;<i>Organizational
Theory and Design,&nbsp;</i>calls this the stableunstable dimension. "An
environment's domain is stable if it remains the same over a period of months
or years. Under unstable conditions, environmental elements shift
abruptly." (Daft: 148) If our routine is unstable, this means the
environment is constantly changing, which requires flexibility. If you can set
your watch by it, as the clich  goes, then it is stable and allows stricter
control. Don't be fooled into thinking that once you identify your environment
as stable, it remains that way; it does not. We need to continually scan our
environment to identify outside changes that affect our design. Certainly, you
can see that the environment helps us determine which design is most
appropriate for our organization. Just like goals, the environment works with
other factors as well.</span></p>

<p><span>21.3.3. The third factor
to consider is the<b>&nbsp;size</b>&nbsp;of your organization. Early in your
career, you learned the term&nbsp;<i>span of control.&nbsp;</i>There are only
so many people one person can effectively manage. Once you reach a point where
you lose effectiveness, new levels of management must be developed and more
structure introduced. Let's assume your whole organization is a five-person
shop. How many levels of supervision would you need? Probably one. Now add two
more workers. Do supervision levels increase? No! How about adding 10, 20, or
100 people? Maybe as the organization grows, so should the level of
supervision. There comes a point where your structure becomes so rigid that
more workers would require few, if any, additional levels of supervision.</span></p>

<p><span>21.3.4.
The last factor we will discuss is&nbsp;<b>technology.</b>&nbsp;According to
Professor Daft, technology refers to the work processes, techniques, machines,
and actions used to transform organizational inputs (materials, information,
ideas) into outputs (products and services). (Daft: 266) We need to look at
what resources we use to accomplish our mission to also help determine the best
design for our organizations. If we primarily use new equipment with unknown
procedures or outcomes, we would need fewer controls and more flexibility than
if we use equipment that is old with known procedures and outcomes. In other
words, if the equipment you use is old and well known, more structure could be
utilized. If the equipment you use is newer, the outcomes or problems you may
encounter require flexibility.</span></p>

<p><span>21.3.5. These four
factors, strategy, environment, size, and technology, all influence how we
should design our organization.</span></p>

<p><span>Let's shift our
attention to four organizational systems or designs we can use to improve unit
effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.4. Designs.</span></b></p>

<p><span>21.4.1. The first design
we will discuss is the&nbsp;<b>mechanistic design</b>. Sometimes referred to as
the bureaucratic structure, it is vertically structured; communication is
basically up and down rather than lateral. As Dr. Robbins puts it, "The
mechanistic model ... is synonymous with the bureaucracy in that it has
extensive departmentalization, high formalization, a limited information
network (mostly downward communication) and little participation by low-level
members in decision-making." (Robbins: 569) Departmentalization means
grouping our work tasks by specialty. The more specialized the tasks, the more
structure is used. By high formalization, we mean a heavy reliance on rules.
Let's look at the mechanistic system in the context of the factors discussed
earlier. The mechanistic system lends itself well to an organization where
strategy or goals are geared toward efficiency; tasks need to be accomplished
quickly and accurately. An environment which is quite stable requires little
flexibility; therefore, a rigid structure or mechanistic design should be used.
If the size of the organization is intermediate to large, more structure is
necessary. As discussed earlier, as organizations grow, new levels of
supervision must be added to maintain control. Finally, technology is known.
What we use to do our jobs is not new. We can predict day to day what will
happen and we have procedures to follow to accomplish our tasks. The
mechanistic organization is very efficient, and responds to decisions rapidly.
Because of the vertical communication, procedures flow from top to bottom
rather quickly. This is very effective for emergency services that rely on
speed. The mechanistic design has disadvantages as well. Because of the
reliance on rules, job satisfaction suffers because subordinates basically do
as they are told with little to no discussion. Limited discussion also leads to
a poor social or human relations environment as well.</span></p>

<p><span>21.4.2.
The&nbsp;<b>organic design</b>&nbsp;is just the opposite of the mechanistic.
This design has horizontal specialization rather than vertical. According to
Dr. Robbins, the organic system is "... flat, uses cross-hierarchical and
cross-functional teams, has low formalization, possesses a comprehensive
information network (utilizing lateral and upward communication as well as
downward), and it involves high participation in decision-making."
(Robbins: 569) Looking at an organizational chart, you would not see much
difference between the mechanistic and the organic design. On the other hand,
the interaction within the organization is quite different. The organic
organization has extensive cross-communication. There is no clear line drawn
for the communication path to follow. As workers need to communicate with
others, they do so, free of bureaucratic lines. The organic system allows joint
decision-making and encourages subordinates to voice their opinions. Looking
back at the factors, the organic organization's strategy is geared toward
innovativeness and creativity. The computer software industry is a good example
of one that requires a creative rather than a restrictive system. The
environment is unstable; with change being the norm rather than the exception.
Therefore, an organic system is needed. The size should be small to moderate
because this type of organization requires loose rules. Technology is fairly
new with outcomes that are unknown, requiring adaptation rather than
compliance. The organic system lends itself well to research and development
organizations that are creative rather than restrictive. The strengths of an
organic organization lie within communication. The sharing of information and
participative environment increase worker satisfaction and often produce
wellrounded decisions. Unfortunately, the organic design's communication slows
down the implementation process. This slow response leads to low efficiency. In
addition, the organic organization's flexibility reduces standards. In other
words, if the same task is performed every three months, they may be handled
differently each time.</span></p>

<p><span>21.4.3.
There are very few organizations that are purely mechanistic or organic. For
this reason, we have another design that incorporates the strengths of both,
the&nbsp;<b>diverse</b>&nbsp;design. This design is used when the organization
needs the rigid structure of the mechanistic organization for one section and
the flexibility of the organic for another. For example, the administrative
section has specific rules to follow when processing performance reports,
decorations, and orders. For this purpose, they would require a mechanistic
system. In the same organization, you may have a section that conducts
training. The mechanistic system would hinder the creativity required for such
a section; therefore, an organic system would be more effective. Because the
organization uses both mechanistic and organic systems to accomplish the
mission, the organizational design is considered diverse. The diverse
organization incorporates the best of both designs to accomplish the mission.</span></p>

<p><span>21.4.4.
The last design we will look at is the&nbsp;<b>matrix design</b>. Basically,
developing a matrix is teaming workers from different sections or organizations
together to solve problems or serve a function. We do this quite often. The
disaster preparedness section, mobility section, and process action teams are
good examples of a matrix. The distinguishing factor in a matrix is the chain
of command. In the matrix design, subordinates have two bosses. They have their
functional boss, who writes their performance report and schedules normal duty
hours, and the project boss or team leader. The strength of the matrix design
lies in the pooling of expertise and resources, and the weaknesses lie in the
confusion of who is in charge; the functional or project boss. One note of
caution; the matrix is not a design in itself. Basically the matrix is a design
within a design. In other words, an organization designed mechanistically that
develops a Process Action Team to work a project does not become a matrix.
Actually, they are a mechanistic organization with a matrix. A matrix is
usually short-lived, so the overall organizational structure remains intact.</span></p>

<p><span>21.4.5.
As managers in today's Air Force, your job is to ensure organizations are
operating at peak performance. One way of accomplishing that responsibility is
to set up organizations effectively. We need to look at our units from the
standpoint of our organizational strategy; the environment or an outside
influence on our organization, the size of our organization, and the technology
or advances in the equipment we use day to day. Once we understand how these
factors relate to our organization, we can decide what structure would best
accomplish our mission. Is the organization geared toward the rigid mechanistic
structure, the flexible organic structure, a combination (the diverse
structure), or do we need to use specialized teams to solve a problem as in the
matrix structure? These are decisions made by the effective leader. By
designing our organizations properly, we are designing the organization that
will capitalize on strengths and minimize weaknesses. As you can see,
organizational design goes much further than the organizational chart.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 21C Managing
Organizational Change</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>21.5. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The British created a
civil service job in 1803 requiring a man stand on the White Cliffs of Dover
with a spyglass. He was supposed to ring a bell if he saw Napoleon coming.
Despite Napoleon's defeat in 1813, the job existed until 1945.</span></p>

<p><span>21.5.1.
What's wrong with this picture? The scenario illustrates an improvement, not to
mention a significant cost-saving opportunity that was ignored for over 130
years! We know change is inevitable. We know changes are taking place every
day, all around us. We know change is easy, right? Wrong! As the scenario above
shows, change is not automatic and doesn t just happen.</span></p>

<p><span>21.5.2.
Change can be a complicated and often painful process. Senior enlisted leaders
are in key positions to manage change. They have the authority and
responsibility to lead and manage organizations, many years of experience, and
technical proficiency. However, as leaders, they must also become proficient
organizational change managers.</span></p>

<p><span>21.5.3. This section
explores the change process using the model proposed by renowned social
psychologist Kurt Lewin, who recommended leaders view change as a three-stage
process: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.6. Stage 1: Unfreezing.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Leaders
begin organizational change by unfreezing, which means going where the hurt
is where people feel the pain of poor policies or systems. Organizational
change is defined as the adoption of a new idea or behavior by an organization
(Daft, 452); the establishment of new norms. These norms can be grouped in
various categories, including technology, tasks, structure, and people norms:
(1) technology:<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>computers, test equipment, weapons systems,
etc.; (2) tasks: general procedures, job steps, checklists, etc.; (3)
structure: administrative procedures, evaluation systems, etc.; and (4)
people:&nbsp;technical or leadership training, new jobs, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.1.
Regardless of what specifically needs to change, the first step is to recognize
the need for change and this step is far from easy. Change is appropriate when
there is a perceived gap between what the norms are and what they should be.
This perception starts the momentum to begin unfreezing.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.2.
Unfreezing is a deliberate management activity to prepare people for change.
Leaders create an environment where people feel the need for change. This is
often the most neglected, yet essential part of unfreezing. A key factor in
unfreezing involves making people knowledgeable about the importance of a
change and how it will affect their jobs. Leaders must first generate a need in
the people who will feel the greatest effect of the change. They do this by
pointing out the problems or challenges with current operations. In many cases,
people will want to stick to the old norms.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.3.
The first reaction to change is usually resistance. Just as change is
inevitable, so is resistance to change. An essential element for successful
change is having a good plan. Planning enables the change agent to anticipate
problems, develop courses of action, and deal with resistance. Resistance can
take many forms. Four of the most common are:</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Uncertainty.</b>&nbsp;When
faced with impending change, people often experience fear of the unknown, or
see the change as a threat to their security: Can I do the new job? Can I
operate the new equipment? Will I still have a job?</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Self-interest.</b>&nbsp;People
often consider the power they currently have or their role in the existing environment
and question the possible loss of power after the change is implemented.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Different
Perception/No Felt Need to Change.</b>&nbsp;Even if you think people recognize
the need for change, they may see the situation differently. Outwardly, they
may support the change, but inwardly, they resist it.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.3.4.&nbsp;<b>Over-Determination.</b>&nbsp;Ironically,
organization structure may be a barrier to change. For example, a mechanistic
structure that relies on strict procedure and lines of authority may be so
rigid that it inhibits change.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>21.6.4.
When making change, success depends on managing and reducing resistance, and a
change agent becomes vitally important. Leaders must accept the role of change
agent in order to manage change. Senior enlisted leaders have vast influence on
their subordinates, peers, and superiors. Commanders and directors often call
upon senior noncommissioned officers to change an organization, to  make it
happen.  Here are five proven methods leaders employ to reduce and manage
resistance to change:</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Education
and Communication.</b>&nbsp;Educating people about the need for, and expected
results of, a change should reduce their resistance. Open communication is
necessary throughout the change process and helps reduce uncertainty.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Participation
and Involvement.&nbsp;</b>Leaders reduce resistance by actively involving those
affected in designing and implementing change. Involving people in the process
may be time-consuming, but should help commit them to the new program.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Facilitation
and Support.</b>&nbsp;Introduce the change gradually, if possible. Provide
additional training if needed. Reinforce and encourage people as much as
possible. Remember the power of high expectations.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.4.4.&nbsp;<b>Negotiation
and Agreement.</b>&nbsp;Offer incentives to those who continue to resist the
change. Negotiated agreements can help remind everyone of the changes they
agreed upon should resistance return.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.4.5.&nbsp;<b>Coercion.</b>&nbsp;This
technique involves using force to get people to accept change. This is a last
resort because compulsion negatively affects attitudes, and has long-term
negative consequences. Coerced compliance requires constant leadership
oversight to ensure the change remains in effect.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.5.
There are usually many factors to consider, whether maintaining current norms
(the status quo) or changing current norms. The change agent must analyze
restraining (opposing) forces and devise ways to reduce them to overcome
resistance. At the same time, leaders must recognize and strengthen driving
(supporting) forces those forces pushing toward change. After analyzing the
forces for and against change and developing a strategy to deal with them,
leaders can attend to the change itself. Leaders improve the chance of success
when they break the change into sequential steps. This approach provides
visible success early, which may encourage people to support the rest of the
change program.</span></p>

<p><span>21.6.6.
The unfreezing stage should be addressed whenever change is imminent. Careful
planning is an essential element of unfreezing, improving chances of success
and decreasing the likelihood of having to repeat the unfreezing stage. Your
plan should include a set of evaluation standards to measure the degree of
success or failure of the change. An evaluation with clear goals and objectives
can help assess the success of change and help determine appropriate rewards
when the change has been completed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.7. Stage 2: Changing.</span></b></p>

<p><span>This
stage involves modifying technology, tasks, structure, or distribution of
people. This is the movement from the old state, or the previous norms, to the
new state. During the changing stage, the organization installs new equipment,
restructures work centers, or implements a new performance appraisal system. In
short, changing is anything that alters the status quo.</span></p>

<p><span>21.7.1.
Your role as change agent in this stage is to monitor the change as it occurs
and pay close attention to the people most affected by it. If you ve
implemented the change too early, you ll know it by watching the people s
reactions. If some link in the system isn t ready to handle the change,
production may bog down. A few irate callers from other branches or units will
let you know in a hurry!</span></p>

<p><span>21.7.2.
In this stage, ensure the plan unfolds as intended. Even the best plans go awry
for one reason or another. Remember, the importance of you being involved as
the change is implemented and be ready to deal with problems that may arise.</span></p>

<p><span>21.7.3.
Provide support at this stage. Some people may be traumatized by the actual
implementation, so you should provide encouragement and advice as needed. The
same techniques used to overcome resistance to change (paragraph 21.6.4) apply
here, too.</span></p>

<p><span>21.7.4.
Go back to the unfreezing stage if the change isn t going well. Going back or
regrouping is better than pressing on with a change that causes more problems
than it fixes. The change agent must decide whether (and when) to move forward.
You must keep tabs on things or you won t be in a position to make this
decision. Don t just plan to change, flip the switch, and let the chips fall
where they may.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>21.8. Stage 3: Refreezing.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
final stage in the change process is refreezing. Just because you implemented a
change and it appears to be going smoothly doesn t mean the job is done. You
must lock in (or refreeze) the desired outcomes and the new norms so they
become permanent.</span></p>

<p><span>21.8.1.
Without refreezing, people often return to the old ways. Consider an Airman who
completes 7-skill level upgrade training and learns the proper way to perform
key tasks in his or her work center. The proper way may differ from the way the
work center completes the tasks. The Airman may be inclined to conform to the
old way rather than make waves:&nbsp;old behaviors take over and nothing
changes. Actively encouraging the use of new techniques and reinforcing them
encourages others to use them, essentially freezing the new behavior. A
critical step in refreezing is evaluating results. Did the change have the
desired effect? If so, press on. If not, the new process may need more support,
instruction, training, time, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>21.8.2.
Having developed strategies to evaluate results in Stage 1 of the change
process, now is time to implement them. Positively reinforcing desired outcomes
is crucial. Reward people when they do something right; this strengthens the
correct behaviors and helps freeze them into place. In many cases, the change
agent can call attention to the success of the change and show where it works.
Highlighting successful change helps remove lingering resistance and prevents
people from returning to the old way of doing things.</span></p>

<p><span>21.8.3.
In some cases, even what appears to be successful change management fails in
the end. Years ago, a company bought new computer equipment for the typing
pool, replacing the old electric typewriters with word processing stations. The
new technology included color monitors, advanced software, and high-speed
printers. Everyone was carefully trained. The new equipment was installed for
half the typists at first, then the other half got their new equipment, and the
supervisors (change agents) provided support and encouragement all the way.
Soon the section was turning out professional correspondence in half the time
it previously took. Successful change, you say. Unfortunately, it wasn t. To
cut down on the noise from the printers, portable dividers were installed
between workstations. This isolated the typists from coworkers, who used to be
able to converse back and forth unimpeded. As a result, the previous social
system, which was one of harmony, turned into one of unhappy isolation. Both
the people and the work suffered, and the change plan had to be modified.</span></p>

<p><span>21.8.4.
Do you think the change agents anticipated this outcome and planned for it?
Probably not, but they really weren t at fault. After all, no one can anticipate
everything. The example serves to remind us of the importance of refreezing.
The change agent must evaluate results, reinforce the desired outcomes, and
make constructive modifications as needed.</span></p>

<p><span>21.8.5.
A change agent has a tough job. Carefully planning change; however, can make it
as painless as possible. Managing change is one of the most important
responsibilities you have. Using this three-stage process can help you manage
the inevitable changes, rather than letting the changes manage you.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 21D Conflict
Management</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>21.9. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Conflict
is inevitable in every organization, and is often necessary to reach high
levels of performance. Dr. Kenneth Thomas, author of&nbsp;<i>Conflict and
Conflict Management, the Handbook of Industrial and Organization
Psychology&nbsp;</i>(1976), defines conflict as the  process that results when
one person (or a group) perceives that another person or group is frustrating,
or about to frustrate, an important concern.  Conflict involves incompatible
differences between parties that result in interference or opposition. Such
differences can motivate for positive change or decrease productivity.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.1.&nbsp;<b>Destructive Versus Constructive
Conflict.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Conflict
can be constructive or destructive and becomes destructive when it results in
 barriers' to cooperation and communication. This destroys morale and diverts
energy away from important tasks and initiatives. On the other hand, conflict
can be constructive when managed effectively. Positive conflict results in
problem solutions, greater understanding, and enhanced communication between
individuals or groups. In the past, managers were trained to avoid conflict
because of its negative repercussions. This continues to challenge managers
today as they work feverishly to avoid it altogether. However, managing
conflict effectively offers benefits to the organization like reducing
organizational chaos and stimulating work activity and productivity. Therefore,
to manage conflict successfully, we must first understand some of the sources
of conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.<b>&nbsp;Sources of Conflict.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Many
factors may result in or increase the probability of conflict within an
organization. These factors manifest themselves in combination with other
factors, making it potentially difficult to identify the specific source of the
conflict. Many researchers, however, agree that conflict originates with one or
more of the following stimulants:</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Communication
Factors<i>.&nbsp;</i></b>We often hear that many problems occur due to a
failure in, or a lack of, communication. However, on closer examination, this
usually accounts for a very small portion of the conflicts reported. The real
crux of the problem is miscommunication; for example, when communication is
misinterpreted, inaccurate, or incomplete. For personnel to perform at their
very best, they need constructive, comprehensible, and accurate information;
anything less results in frustration, stress, and failure. Remember, conflict
is defined as frustration of an important concern, whether real or perceived.
Consider your organization and the conflicts that erupted because of poor
communication. Now consider what happens when the communication process fails
altogether. Did the outcomes result in conflict?</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Structural Factors:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Size.&nbsp;</b>Research
shows that organizational size affects the people who work there. Like an
elevator that reaches its maximum capacity, the larger the organization, the
more people there is to cause and participate in conflict. With more personnel
comes more opinions, perspectives, perceptions, etc. As a result, larger
organizations may have unclear goals, more rigid structures, increased
specialization, more levels of supervision, and increased opportunities for
information to become distorted as it passes through each organizational
echelon.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Participation:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.2.2.1.
The more people interact and participate, the more noticeable their differences
become. This can also lead to disputes and conflict, partly because although
people may attempt to participate does not necessarily mean their ideas are
heard or accepted. This rejection can spark frustration and conflict among
members. However, this situation also has the potential to increase
productivity if workers become more creative or competitive and search for better
ways to enhance overall unit performance. This is productive conflict versus
destructive conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.2.2.2.
We want people to challenge the status quo, to seek better ways to do business,
and to continually improve processes. This supports our core value,&nbsp;<i>excellence
in all we do.&nbsp;</i>Such efforts also support our&nbsp;<i>service before
self&nbsp;</i>core value, in that we must be willing to set aside old ways and
personal differences in order to listen to the ideas of others, to include our
newest Airman. We must be willing to change, put self-interests aside, and do
what is right for the Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Line-Staff
Distinctions.&nbsp;</b>Diverse backgrounds and roles can create conflict.
According to Dr. Thomas, this is very noticeable in the line and staff
functions because the roles are so different. Overall, line personnel are
concerned with production and are usually more loyal to the company. Staff
functions usually involve creativity; therefore, staff personnel are usually
more critical of the organization. Moreover, since there are usually different
requirements for staff and line functions, there are different types of
backgrounds for each. These differences in values, training, background, etc.,
can lead to conflict. Consider how line and staff personnel view organizational
goals. Line personnel normally are more concerned with the immediate or
short-range goals, whereas staff personnel are more concerned with long-range
or strategic goals. These differences in background and viewpoints can trigger
conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Rewards.&nbsp;</b>Earning
rewards involves a level of competition, which can lead to conflict. Healthy
competition is not the problem. However, the individuals and groups who
perceive that the rewards were given unfairly or in favor of someone else can
often lead to conflict. For example, one person or department receives
recognition that others feel they deserved but did not receive.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Resource
Interdependence.</b>&nbsp;Most likely, we have all had to compete for resources
at one time or another. When people compete for scarce resources and each party
feels they have a greater need, conflict may arise. Oftentimes, negotiations
fail as each party assumes a directive, or authoritarian position as they
compete for the resource.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.3.<b>&nbsp;Personal Behavior Factors.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Conflict
can arise because of individual differences, such as goals and objectives,
perceptions, values, and personalities. Three such differences, in particular,
may facilitate behaviors that cause conflict: values, perception, and
personality.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Values.<i>&nbsp;</i></b>Values
are very important to people and will determine their behavior. When people s
values are questioned, criticized, or opposed, conflict can result. Some
values, such as religion and politics, seem to incite the biggest arguments and
can lead to fights, but even less emotion-based values can cause conflict. For
example, a worker who values high quality work may see him or herself due a
reward for the quality of the work. Conflict may occur if the unit emphasizes
quantity over quality and rewards someone else instead.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.3.2.&nbsp;<b>Perception.</b>&nbsp;Values
also affect how people perceive situations and other people. If a person
perceives others as lazy and incompetent, how he or she responds to that
perception may cause problems. A person's perception of what constitutes
fairness, quality of work, or constructive techniques can lead to conflict if
these perceptions differ significantly from others or what the organization has
defined for those factors.</span></p>

<p><span>21.9.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Personality.</b>&nbsp;We
have all heard about people who couldn t get along because of a personality
conflict and this isn t uncommon. Put certain personalities together and you
are asking for conflict. Two personality types especially conflict-prone are
the highly authoritarian individual and the low self-esteem individual. The
highly authoritarian personality may antagonize coworkers by escalating
otherwise trivial differences. The low selfesteem personality may feel
threatened by others and therefore overreact. Either type of behavior can
create interpersonal conflict in an organization.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.10. Five Styles of Conflict Management:</span></b></p>

<p><span>21.10.1.
Now that we have an idea of what conflict is and what causes it, we can examine
some ways to manage it. In the book,  <i><u>Conflict and Negotiation Processes
in Organizations,</u>  Handbook of Industrial and Organizational
Psychology&nbsp;</i>(1992),Dr. Thomas suggests five major conflict management
styles: competing (or forcing), collaborating, accommodating, avoiding, and
compromising. Dr. Thomas uses a two-dimensional framework to compare these styles.
The first dimension refers to the degree of cooperation a manager exhibits,
measuring from uncooperative to cooperative. The second dimension measures
assertiveness on a scale from nonassertive (passive) to assertive (active).
Being cooperative refers to how willing a person or group is to satisfy the
other's needs. For example, if Person A gives into the needs of Person B,
Person A is considered cooperative. If Person A assumes a  my way or the
highway  approach, he or she is considered uncooperative.</span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.
From these two dimensions, we can devise a way to manage conflict based on the
situation. Just as situational leadership is based on task and relationship
behavior, conflict management is situational and is based on assertive and
cooperative behavior. With this in mind, let's look at the five styles used to
manage conflict.</span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Competing
(or Forcing).<i>&nbsp;</i></b>This style attempts to overwhelm an opponent with
formal authority, threats, or the use of power. Its underlying features are
being highly assertive and uncooperative.</span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Collaborating.<i>&nbsp;</i></b>The
collaborating style involves an attempt to satisfy the concerns of both sides
through honest discussion. Creative approaches to conflict reduction, such as
sharing resources, may actually lead to both parties being materially better
off. For this style to be successful, trust and openness are required of all
participants. This style is high in assertive behavior and high in cooperation
and seeks a win position for both groups.</span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Accommodating.&nbsp;</b>The
accommodating style combines low assertiveness and high cooperation. At the
simplest level, this style may merely involve giving in to another person s
wishes.</span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Avoiding:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.4.1.
The combination of low assertiveness and low cooperation leads to an avoiding
style. The person implies that he or she will appear to be neutral and it may
not always be possible to adopt a truly neutral position, but a manager may
nonetheless prefer to avoid the situation. Although a manager who avoids difficult
issues is likely to be resented by his or her Airmen, this strategy may be
effective under certain circumstances. For example, a manager may initially
stay out of a disagreement to avoid escalating the conflict during a particular
phase of development. Later, when he or she judges the time is right, the
manager may take a more active role in finding a productive solution.</span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.4.2.
Experienced managers recognize that action is not always necessary because some
problems dissipate over time or are resolved by other organizational processes.
For example, an intense conflict between two Airmen may seem to require
intervention by their manager. If the manager knows that one of the individuals
will soon be transferred to another department or promoted to another position,
ignoring the situation and letting the impending changes resolve the difficulty
may be the best solution.</span></p>

<p><span>21.10.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Compromising.&nbsp;</b>This
style involves intermediate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation to
partially satisfy both parties' desires and achieve a middle ground. To
successfully compromise, both parties must be willing to give up something.
Compromising is common during labor and management disputes.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.11. Applying Conflict Management Style:</span></b></p>

<p><span>21.11.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>When
deciding which style of conflict management to use, consider a few additional
factors. First, consider who you are dealing with. When dealing with a
supervisor or a peer, the competing style of conflict management may not be
applicable. Also, doubtful any of us could force our commander in a conflict
situation. On the other hand, competing may work for a subordinate. You have
the legitimate power to enforce a policy. So knowing&nbsp;<b><i>who&nbsp;</i></b>is
important in deciding the style you can use.</span></p>

<p><span>21.11.2.
Another factor is determining how critical the issue is, also known as
the&nbsp;<b><i>stakes</i></b>. If the issue is critical, you may wish to use
the avoiding style at first to carefully consider the options or gather more
data. However, because the issue is critical, you cannot avoid it for long.
Sooner or later, you will have to confront the issue. Also, if the situation is
critical and you know you are right, you may need to use the competing style to
force your position. Conversely, if the issue is trivial, you could avoid it or
even accommodate the other party. Remember to always consider the&nbsp;<b><i>stakes&nbsp;</i></b>in
the issue.</span></p>

<p><span>21.11.3.
The final factor is the&nbsp;<b><i>situation&nbsp;</i></b>itself. In an
emergency, the competing style might be necessary because there simply is not
enough time to collaborate or compromise. You also cannot avoid an emergency.
However, if time is not an issue and the parties are willing to discuss the
matter, collaboration may be the best way to deal with the conflict situation
because it works best for everyone.</span></p>

<p><span>21.11.4.
Although people may consider some styles of conflict management more effective
(for example, collaborating versus avoiding), all of the conflict management
styles are useful, depending on who, the stakes, and the situation. Using these
five styles allows us to successfully manage conflict, reduce disorder and
chaos, and facilitate creativity and innovative problem solving. Being a
conflict management specialist<i>&nbsp;</i>is just another one of the many
responsibilities of managers!</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 21E Problem
Solving</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>21.12. Overview.</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
use of Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) increases operational capabilities
while reducing associated costs by applying proven methodologies to all
processes associated with fulfilling the Air Force mission. Continuous Process
Improvement is a comprehensive philosophy of operations built around the
concepts that there are always ways a process can be improved to better meet
mission/customer requirements; organizations must constantly strive to make
those improvements based on performance metrics that align to strategic
objectives; and efficiencies should be replicated to the extent practical.
Continuous Process Improvement is a hallmark of highly successful organizations
and a major graded area in Air Force Inspection System (AFI 90-201,&nbsp;<i>Air
Force Inspection System</i>) and a commander responsibility in AFI 1-2,&nbsp;<i>Commander s
Responsibilities</i>.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.13.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Continuous Process Improvement uses Structured Problem
Solving.</b></span></p>

<p><span>The core of Air Force
process improvement is the Practical Problem Solving Method. The Practical
Problem Solving</span></p>

<p><span>Method
is a standardized and structured approach to problem solving utilized in
commercial industry and adopted by the Air Force. The Practical Problem Solving
Method is an 8-step process used to clarify problems, identify root causes, and
develop appropriate countermeasures to achieve change. Typically, the Practical
Problem Solving Method is illustrated using the A3 format.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></span></p>

<p><b><span>21.14.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Identifying Improvement Opportunities.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Oftentimes
the success of an organization relies on its ability to identify opportunities
for process improvement. Much like industry partners, the Air Force must strive
for continuous process improvement. Customer demand, processing, budgeting, and
work force needs are all factors organizations have to effectively manage to
survive. The Air Force contends with the same issues as global operations
continue: readiness, training, and modernization have to be managed with less
monetary freedom. The application of Practical Problem Solving Method provides
a methodical approach to identifying opportunities for improvements through all
process within the Air Force. Consistently applied, the Practical Problem
Solving Method provides an excellent tool to make data-driven decisions with
regards to management, process change, and the sharing of best
practices.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>21.14.1.&nbsp;<b>Strategic
Alignment.&nbsp;</b>Strategic alignment provides the framework to ensure
resources and actions of subordinate levels align to and achieve the strategy,
mission, vision, priorities, and objectives of the enterprise. The Strategic
Plan identifies the current mission, vision for the future, and prioritizes
objectives to get from the current state to the future vision. The Strategic
Plan also communicates Commander's intent and assigns responsibility.
Imperative is that all improvement efforts align with the organization s
efforts to accomplish the overall Strategic Plan's objectives. AFI 1-2,&nbsp;<i>Commander s
Responsibilities,</i>&nbsp;requires commanders to strive for strategic
alignment within their organization.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.1.1.&nbsp;The critical first step to effective
problemsolving is to clearly understand the problem. A problem solving effort
that begins with  We all know what the problem is, so just get it fixed now? 
sets us up for failure before we begin. This  fly by the seat of your pants
approach  leads to several errors. First, because the  obvious solution  is
often based purely on the experience level of the problem solver, which
misdiagnose the underlying problem. Secondly, this mindset is closed to the
possibility of innovative solutions which are better suited to solving the real
problem. A well-defined problem statement uses data to identify where the
problem is occurring and impact of the problem, and compares performance
against a standard with scope and direction. The statement does not make</span></p>

<p><span>assumptions of a root
cause, solution and/or countermeasure and includes visual tools to depict the
current state.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.1.2.
The Who, What, When, Where, and significance of the problem statement should be
validated by data. This is done by collecting and analyzing data to both
validate the existence and magnitude of the problem. If data does not exist,
the effort should be paused to collect and analyze the needed data&nbsp;<i>before</i>&nbsp;moving
forward. Tools to consider for Step 1 are Strategic Alignment; Voice of the
Customer; Supplier, Input, Process, Output, Customer Diagram; and Value Stream
map.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.2.<b>&nbsp;Step 2 Break Down Problem and
Identify Performance Gaps:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.15.2.1.
Once the problem has been clearly identified and answers the Who, What, When,
and Where of the problem statement, efforts are made to further analyze the
data in comparison to the voice of the customer. The voice of the customer
gives the standard to measure from. The delta between the current state
(otherwise known as the voice of the process) and voice of the customer will
highlight opportunities for improvements (also called the performance gap).
Often, the more thorough the evaluation of a problem in this step, the more
effective and concise the Practical Problem Solving Method will be.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.2.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>A
critical step in assessing a problem is gathering and reviewing data on the
process. Understanding what appropriate data is required and the ability to
interpret that data is paramount to performance gap analysis. Step 2
effectively frames and supports the problem in Step 1 using data. Tools to
consider for Step 2 are  Go &amp; See  and metrics that help better define the
gap between the voice of the customer and voice of the
process.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.<b>&nbsp;Step 3 Set Improvement Targets:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.1.
Air Force leaders establish a vision of what an organization will strive to
become (the Ideal State). In Step 3, process owners and/or project sponsors set
improvement targets based on voice of the customer and strategic goals and objectives.
Targets help define the required performance levels to achieve the vision.
Targets should be challenging but achievable and have certain characteristics:
Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Resultsfocused, and Time-bound (SMART). The
project should obtain a vector check upon completion to ensure strategic
alignment with the project champion. Tools to consider for Step 3 are Ideal
State Map, SMART objectives, setting goals.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.2.&nbsp;<b>SMART Objectives are:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Specific:&nbsp;</b>Have
desirable outputs based on subject matter expert knowledge and experience
applicable to the process improvement activity. Specific targets should answer
who is involved, what is to accomplish, where it is to be done, when it is to
be done (time frame), which (Identify requirements and constraints) and why
(Specific reasons, purpose or benefits of accomplishing the goal).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Measurable:</b>&nbsp;Include
time frames and data obtainable from specific sources. Establish criteria for
measuring progress toward the attainment of each goal. To determine if your
goal is measurable, ask questions such as......How much? How many? How will I
know when it is accomplished?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Attainable:&nbsp;</b>Resources
are available; may have some risk, but success is possible.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Results-Focused:&nbsp;</b>The
mission, vision, and goals are linked and meaningful to the user.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.3.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Time-bound:&nbsp;</b>Provide
date for completion. Targeted dates provide measurable
accountability.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.4.<b>&nbsp;Step 4 Determine Root Cause.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Air
Force leaders often find themselves addressing problems which have been
 solved  many times because previous problem-solving efforts were directed
at&nbsp;<i>symptoms&nbsp;</i>of a problem rather than the&nbsp;<i>root cause</i>&nbsp;of
the problem. If an aircraft is constantly breaking down and cannot perform its
mission, should the goal be to reduce aircraft usage, improve repair cycle
time, improve the quality of replacement parts, improve the aircraft design, or
improve the aircraft design process? Each step becomes increasingly difficult
to evaluate, but each step also has a greater impact in the elimination of the
problem. Root cause analysis is a tradeoff between digging as deeply as
possible and finding the deepest point still within the team's sphere of
influence. The correct root cause should be validated by using the same data
used to define the problem in Step 1. Tools to consider for Step 4 are 5 Whys,
brainstorming, Pareto Chart, Affinity diagram, fishbone diagram, and control
charts.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.5.<b>&nbsp;Step 5 Develop Countermeasures:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.15.5.1.
Step 5 is where process changes that directly corrects, influences, affects
each of your root causes are developed. Air Force leaders should follow
important guidelines to ensure the greatest likelihood of success. A key
principle to remember is that the impact of a solution is a combination of the
quality of the solution and the acceptance of the solution by the people who
must implement it. The relationship is similar to the following formula:
(Quality of the solution) x (Acceptance) = Impact. Also, when developing countermeasures
strive for process improvement change that is sustainable and repeatable.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.5.2.
Address potential root causes with countermeasures which conform to lean
principles and are the most practical and effective,  keep it simple.  Validate
countermeasures will close performance gaps when implemented. Countermeasures
should move the organization closer to the ideal state and support strategic
plans. Also recommended is to build consensus, when possible and appropriate,
with all stakeholders involved.&nbsp;Judiciously involving stakeholders
in the development of countermeasures sponsors ownership of the solution and
its success. At the end of this step, obtain a vector check from the champion
to ensure strategic alignment.&nbsp;The champion approves the countermeasures
prior to implementation. Tools to consider for Step 5 are Sort, Straighten,
Shine, Standardize, Sustain; brainstorming; multi-voting; Possible, Implement,
Challenge, Kill Chart; errorproofing; standard work; cell/flow design; and
Future State Map.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.6.<b>&nbsp;Step 6 See Countermeasures
Through.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Step
6 is seeing countermeasures through execution and tracking of detailed
implementation plans for each countermeasure approved in Block 5 of the
Practical Problem Solving Method. The champion should be updated regularly on
all tasks status until countermeasures have been implemented or deemed
unnecessary as target state has been met. Devoting time and resources towards
developing an action plan without action should be considered waste. Tools to
consider for Step 6 are Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, Sustain; visual
management, standard work, cell/flow design, variation reduction,
error-proofing, quick changeover, and the rapid improvement event.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.7.<b>&nbsp;Step 7 Confirm Results and
Process:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.15.7.1.
Step 7 compares the results of implemented countermeasures to the identified
performance gaps and improvement targets. Verify the improved process is
sustainable and repeatable. Results are measured by data and analyzed to
confirm the project's intent. Illustrate confirmed results with appropriate
data tool(s) which link back to performance gap(s) in Step 2 and improvement
target(s) in Step 3. Tools to consider during step 7 are key performance
indicators/metrics and strategic alignment.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.7.2. Processes
should be monitored for:</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.7.2.1. Performance
relative to the baseline developed in Steps 1 and 2.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.7.2.2. Performance
relative to SMART targets established in Step 3.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.7.2.3. Performance
relative to the solution implementation.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.7.2.4. If you are
not meeting targets, you may need to return to Step 4. Incorrect root-cause
determination is the most common mistake made during continuous process
improvement efforts.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.8.<b>&nbsp;Step 8 Standardize Successful
Processes:</b></span></p>

<p><span>21.15.8.1.
Step 8 is the most commonly skipped and under-completed step of the entire
Practical Problem Solving Method. Some people are tempted to take newfound
knowledge and skills and immediately move on to the next improvement
initiative, skipping the effort to ensure the results are codified.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.8.2. This step is
defined by answers to three questions:</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.8.2.1.&nbsp;<b>What
is needed to standardize the improvements?</b>&nbsp;This could be Airmen
Powered by Innovation (API) program input, changes to technical orders, Air
Force instructions, operating instructions, equipment materiel, or using a
different vendor or supplier.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.8.2.2.&nbsp;<b>How
should improvements and lessons learned be communicated?</b>&nbsp;This could be
accomplished through input into Air Force CPI Portal, key meetings, Air Force
publications, Public Affairs, chain of command, or SharePoint sites. Leaders
should ensure the Wing Process Manager is aware of the success.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.8.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Were
other opportunities or problems identified by the problem-solving model?</b>&nbsp;This
project may have identified additional problem-solving opportunities.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.8.3.
Effective problem solving should follow the Practical Problem Solving Method.
Attempting to skip, reorder, or shortcut steps invariably leads to suboptimal
solutions or failure. Following the Practical Problem Solving Method ensures
actions lead to the desired results with minimal waste. It also ensures the
results are aligned with the needs of the organization. Properly applied, the
Practical Problem Solving Method is aligned to the organization's purpose and
activities and increases Air Force combat effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.9.<b>&nbsp;Methodologies.&nbsp;</b>Air
Force CPI incorporates aspects of four major CPI methodologies. A Practical
Problem Solving Method solution may simultaneously draw from more than one of
the CPI methods.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.9.1.<b>&nbsp;Lean.</b>&nbsp;A
methodology focused on work flow, customer value, and eliminating process
waste; unique from traditional process improvement strategies in that its
primary focus is on eliminating non-value added activities.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.9.2.&nbsp;<b>Six
Sigma.&nbsp;</b>A rigorous, data-driven methodology for process improvement
focused on minimizing waste through identifying, controlling, and reducing
process variation.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.9.3.&nbsp;<b>Business
Process Reengineering.</b>&nbsp;A comprehensive process requiring a change in
the fundamental way business processes are performed. Business process
reengineering identifies unnecessary activities and eliminates them wherever
possible.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.9.4.<b>&nbsp;Theory
of Constraints.</b>&nbsp;A systematic approach to optimize resource utilization
by identifying, exploiting, subordinating, elevating, and reassessing
constraints (bottlenecks) in the process.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.10.<b>&nbsp;Practical
Problem Solving Method Level of Effort.</b>&nbsp;Different levels of effort are
required to accomplish this method initiative.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.10.1.&nbsp;<b>Just
Do It:&nbsp;</b>Also called point improvement, this involves one person (or a
small team) and can be accomplished in less than a day. Examples could be using
torque wrenches instead of adjustable wrenches, or routing paperwork via email
instead of the post office or paper distribution channels.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.10.2.&nbsp;<b>Rapid
Improvement Event:</b>&nbsp;A rapid improvement event consists of a small team
of individuals, usually subject matter experts, and can be accomplished in less
than a week and is designed to develop and implement countermeasures after
appropriate project preparations have been made. Examples could be improving
aircraft servicing cycle times, or improving first-time pass yields on task
management tool taskers.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.10.3.&nbsp;<b>Improvement
Project:</b>&nbsp;This setting requires a large team and is conducted over a
longer period of time. Examples might be shortening aircraft annual overhaul
cycle time or writing software to track annual overhauls.</span></p>

<p><span>21.15.11.<b>&nbsp;Summary.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Practical
Problem Solving Method is a structured method to CPI. It is flexible enough to
be effective at any level, from Headquarters Air Force, to the individual
Airman. This single-piece of paper approach provides a standardized template
for Airmen to solve problems and perform process improvement initiatives. If you
have questions on the usage of Practical Problem Solving Method or want to get
more training related to CPI philosophies, please contact your local Manpower
office for training at your location.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 21F Project
Management</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>21.16. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>"Project
management? I'm not in the plans and programs business; so why should I worry
about managing a project?"&nbsp;These are questions which may be on
your mind right now. If so, you may be right, for now. However, you have the
likelihood of taking positions in the future which will or do involve the sound
management of a multitude of resources. Even if you are not involved in the
management of a long-term project involving millions of dollars' worth of
resources, the benefits of obtaining knowledge of project management principles
and their application will make you a better planner and manager.</span></p>

<p><span>In
addition, these same skills will easily blend with your other management skills
to improve your effectiveness as a manager and a leader. Scores of books have
been written on the topic of project management, and this short reading cannot
make you fully knowledgeable of all aspects of project management. However,
this reading will familiarize you with some of project management's essential
terminology and illustrate practical uses of project management principles.
Project management cannot be understood unless you know a little bit about the
project management language.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.17.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>Project Management.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Project
management uses a unique array of terminology to communicate its principles and
use. The first term we should probably clear up right away is the term
"project management." According to Hersey and Blanchard in their
book&nbsp;<i>Management&nbsp;</i>of&nbsp;<i>Organizational Behavior,&nbsp;</i>management
is defined as the process of working with and through individuals and groups
and other resources to accomplish organizational goals (Hersey and Blanchard:
5). In their book,&nbsp;<i>Successful Project Managers,&nbsp;</i>Jeffrey K.
Pinto and O.P. Kharbanda define project as a combination of human and non-human
resources pulled together in a temporary organization to achieve a specified
purpose (Pinto and Kharbanda: 13). Although there are many definitions to
choose from, for the purpose of this reading we'll use Pinto and Kharbanda's
definition of project management: the process of leading, coordinating,
planning, and controlling a diverse and complex set of processes and people in
the pursuit of achieving project objectives (Pinto and Kharbanda: 17). With
this definition in mind, it may be worthy to examine what project management is
not. A project is not a program; programs are ongoing. A project, by
definition, is something temporary. Although temporary could be in terms of
years, a project is unlike a program. You are involved with many programs in
your work centers, and programs are ongoing. A project has a single objective,
which has some time frame attached to it. Armed with project management's basic
definition, we can now expand on project management's other terms.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.
Some of the terminology used in project management is contained in the&nbsp;<b>Figure
21.1. Project&nbsp;</b>basic steps of project management. These steps are
depicted in Figure 21.1 and&nbsp;<b>Management Steps.</b>&nbsp;appear in the
book&nbsp;<i>Fundamentals of Project Management,&nbsp;</i>by James P.
Lewis&nbsp;(Lewis: 7).</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.1.<i>&nbsp;</i><b>Define
the Project Objective.&nbsp;</b>Identify the problem or objective to be solved,
or the improvement to be achieved by the project. What client need is being
satisfied by the project?</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Develop
Solution Options.&nbsp;</b>How many ways might you go about solving the
problem? Of the available alternatives, which do you think will best solve the
problem? Some decision analysis techniques will come into play here.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.3.<b>&nbsp;Plan
the Project.&nbsp;</b>Planning is nothing more than answering questions what
must be done, by whom, for how much, how, when, and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.4.<b>&nbsp;Execute
the Plan.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>People sometimes go to great length and effort to put
together a plan, but then fail to follow it. Follow your plan.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.5.<b>&nbsp;Monitor
and Control Progress</b><i>.&nbsp;</i>The project manager must monitor and
control by being present and making appropriate decisions. This is where you'l1
determine whether or not the plan was sound and can make adjustments as
necessary.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.6.<b>&nbsp;Close the Project.&nbsp;</b>Once
the objective has been achieved, the project is finished, but there is still a
final step that should be taken. It's time for lessons learned what went well,
what didn't, and what should be improved? (Lewis: 7)</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.1.7.
Ultimately, the goal is to achieve the objective of the project in the most
logical, sensible manner. By following these steps, you will succeed. Sound simple?
We all know there is more to it than just knowing the steps. Once a realization
of the steps of project management is attained, accomplishing these steps
requires understanding of some more terminology.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.2.
Before you can complete Step 1 of project management, you have to ensure the
problem or improvement opportunity is clearly defined by the project objective.
You might say that an objective is simply a goal, but in reality, when it comes
to project management, an objective has to be more specific than a typical
broad goal. According to Marion E. Haynes in her book,&nbsp;<i>Project
Management: From Idea to Implementation,&nbsp;</i>good objectives are SMART.
SMART is an acronym, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented,
Realistic, and Time-limited.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.2.1. Specific
because a good objective says exactly what you want it to say.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.2.2. Measurable
because you want to be able to determine whether you have met the objective.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.2.3.
Action-oriented by using statements that have action-tense verbs and are
complete sentences. In other words, make the objective active voice, not
passive voice.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.2.4. Realistic
because good objectives must be attainable yet should present a challenge.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.2.5. Time-limited
because a specific time should be set by which to achieve the objective
(Haynes: 16).</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.3.
For example, "Accomplish the renovation of the office area" would be
an example of a goal you wish to achieve. A SMART objective for such a goal
might be: "Renovate the office area by June 30, 200X at a cost not to
exceed $12,000." By specifying the objective of the project, you can now
determine the constraints you have to operate under.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.4.
Constraints are numerous for all activities we endeavor, but constraint
consideration is crucial for project management. According to Geoff Reiss in
his book,&nbsp;<i>Project Management Demystified,&nbsp;</i>quality, time, and
cost are the main constraints realized in project management. Quality refers to
being in accordance with the requirement - the specifications. Time refers to
the amount of time you have to complete the project. Cost, of course, refers to
your resource constraints, to include the four M's necessary to complete the
project: money, manpower, machinery, and materials. One of these constraints
(Quality, Time, and Cost) will be your driver for the project (Reiss: 39). To
understand the meaning of driver, let's examine some of National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's projects. In the 1960s, a manned vehicle called
Sputnik broke through the earth's atmosphere, and the space race began. In an
effort to catch-up, time became a driver for National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's project to launch a man into space. The amount of money spent
or the quality of the materials, although important, did not drive the project.
However, during the 1980s, the explosion of the Challenger caused National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to change drivers. Now quality became the
driver for future projects. The driver for your project will have an impact on
the other two constraints affecting your project. Ensure you take this into
consideration when making decisions about your project's objective. If time is
the driver, the T of your SMART objective needs to be reflective of that
driving influence. If quality is your driver, the S of your SMART objective
needs to be predominant. How will quality being your driver affect the other
constraints? Quality increases the amount of time taken and increases the
expense of materials. You must always remain cognizant of the impact one
constraint has on another and adjust the management of your project
accordingly. Ultimately, your driver and affected constraints will have an
impact on the solutions you develop. As the project manager, it is incumbent
upon you to provide the leadership and use good team-building techniques to
establish a sound project objective and generate the solution options necessary
to achieve those objectives. Once these steps have been completed, it will then
be time to embark upon the most important and timeconsuming aspect of project
management planning.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.5.
As indicated earlier, planning the project involves answering several
questions. The first of those questions is: what must be done? The answer is
contained in the objective of the project, but more specifics are needed.
Haynes states that the starting place for answering the question of what must
be done is by using a work breakdown structure. A work breakdown structure is a
technique based on dividing a project into sub-units, or work packages. Since
all the elements required to complete the project are identified in the work
breakdown structure, the chances of neglecting or overlooking an essential step
are minimized. A work breakdown structure is typically constructed with two or
three levels of detail, although more levels are quite common depending on the
complexity of the project (Haynes: 25). To illustrate using an elementary
example, Figure 21.2 depicts a work breakdown structure for a typical yard
project. Granted, a work breakdown structure would not usually be constructed
for such a project, but to illustrate the concept, it is best to use something
very simple to start with.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.6.
Graphically, you can quickly ascertain the necessary tasks to complete the
project. Such a structure for your project will permit you, and others who see
the work breakdown structure, to readily identify what needs to be done, spot
omissions which might later affect the outcome of the project, and make
suggestions for improving and expanding the work breakdown structure. How much
is too much detail? According to Lewis, the general guideline is that you stop
breaking down the work when you reach a point at which you can estimate to the
desired degree of accuracy, or at which the work will take an amount of time
equal to the smallest units you want to schedule (Lewis: 41 ). Taking Figure
21.2's work breakdown structure as an example, although the  trim hedge 
element of the project is an element that needs to be included as part of the
work breakdown structure, it is not necessary to further indicate whether the
hedge should be squared or rounded, done from left to right or top to bottom,
etc. The amount of breakdown is an element the project manager and the project
team must decide upon. Once the work breakdown structure has been tweaked and
finalized, the next step is task analysis.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 21.2. Work Breakdown Structure.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>21.17.7. Like the work breakdown structure, the amount of detail
needed for the task analysis depends on the task involved and the desires of
the project manager and project team. The more complex the project, the greater
the importance of detailed task analysis. Figure 21.3 depicts a typical task
analysis and details considered using our elementary example task pertaining to
the yard project. As you can see from the example, a wealth of&nbsp;</span><sub><span>&nbsp;</span></sub><span>information is contained
about the</span></p>

<p><sub><span>&nbsp;</span></sub><span>task which is not depicted in the
work&nbsp;breakdown&nbsp;structure,&nbsp;to
include task milestones, more specific information of how the milestones can be
measured, and identification of dependent tasks, budgetary concerns, task assignments,
and reporting requirements. As the project manager, you can delegate the task
analysis for each task to the appropriate person. Once they are compiled, you
can make final decisions on task assignments and budgetary concerns. The task
analysis is what provides the crucial information for determining how the tasks
of the project interrelate. For example, in the case of the yard project, the
tasks associated with preparing the equipment must be completed prior to any of
the other tasks being accomplished. There is no sense in accomplishing cleanup
if you haven't done any of the work yet. Although this example may seem to be
common sense, when larger projects are in the planning stage, it is imperative
the proper sequencing of tasks occurs prior to beginning a project to ensure
the efficiency of the project. You wouldn't want carpet installed in your home
prior to painting the ceiling and the walls, right? Once a task analysis has
been performed on all tasks associated with the project, the next phase of
project management, scheduling, must be conducted.</span></p>

The advent of computer software has made scheduling tasks for projects much
easier than it used to be. According to Lewis, until around 1958, the only tool
for scheduling projects was the bar chart (Lewis: 50). Figure 21.4 below
depicts a simple bar chart constructed from a word-processing software package
using a table. As you can see, the time taken to complete a task is depicted
graphically as one of the dark colored bars in 5-minute increments.&nbsp;</span></p>

Lewis indicates that prior to the advent of project management software,
similar charts were used. Chart such as the one depicted in Figure 21.4., above
were called Gantt charts, named after Henry Gantt, the developer of this
notational system. Until the advent of computer software packages, Gantt charts
had one serious drawback determining the impact of a slip of one task, on the
rest of the project was very difficult. To overcome this problem, two methods
of scheduling were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s that used arrow
diagrams to capture the sequential and parallel relationships among project
activities. One method was called critical path method, developed by DuPont;
the other, performance evaluation and review technique, was developed by the
Navy and the Booze, Allen and Hamilton Consulting Group. The major difference
between the two methods is the ability performance evaluation and review
technique has to calculate the probability that an activity will be completed
by a certain time, whereas critical path method does not (Lewis: 51). It is
important to point out that critical path method is a method of scheduling used
when the time for completing each task of the project is well known, whereas
performance evaluation and review technique is used when task durations within
a project (usually a large project) are unknown or difficult to predict. For
example, in the case of the yard project, if you had performed the various
tasks before, you would be able to accurately estimate the amount of time it
would take to complete the tasks based upon your own personal experience.
Therefore, critical path method would be a simpler method for scheduling.
However, in the case of a large project where estimates are not based upon
personal experience, performance evaluation and review technique might be a
more appropriate method for scheduling. According to Haynes, a way to deal with
the lack of precision in estimating time is to use a commonly accepted formula
for the task. The estimate is derived in the following way (Figure 21.5.):</span></p>

  the pessimistic (longest) time, and&nbsp;<i>Te</i>&nbsp;= the calculated time
  estimate. Then The following formula would apply:</span></p>
  <p align="center"><span>??0+4????+????</span></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 21.5. Formula for the
Task.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>21.17.10.&nbsp;Once&nbsp;a&nbsp;time&nbsp;duration&nbsp;is
determined for each sub-unit of the project, the next step is to determine the
earliest and latest starting times for each sub-unit (Haynes: 31). Both
critical path method and performance evaluation and review technique methods
are used for what is termed network analysis. According to Reiss, network analysis
is simply breaking down any project into activities or tasks and then deciding
how long each task will take and how each of these activities relate to one
another. From this data, you calculate the timing of each element and predict
which activities or tasks are vital to the success of the project (Reiss: 46).
The analysis (a simple graphical expansion of the task analysis) is depicted
using bar charts, critical path method, performance evaluation and review
technique, or a combination of the three. For critical path method and
performance evaluation and review technique, a common convention used is called
activity on arrow or precedence. For the purpose of this reading, we will refer
to the technique as strictly&nbsp;<i>precedence.&nbsp;</i>To better understand
this technique, the following series of diagrams and accompanying explanation
is provided. In Figure 21.6 below, the precedence, or task to be accomplished,
is indicated on the line between the two circles. According to Reiss, the words
written above the line describe the task and are known as the task description.
This task or activity (precedence) takes a certain period of time. We call the
circles&nbsp;<i>events&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<i>nodes,&nbsp;</i>and they illustrate
the completion or the beginning of events. Reiss goes on to say that the circles
can also be squares, diamonds, or a variety of other symbols, depending on what
technique is being employed (Reiss: 49).</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="184" height="40" src="afh1_files/image392.png" ></span><b></b></p>

<p><b><span>Figure 21.6. The Precedence or Task&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>21.17.11. To expand this concept a little, let's take a look at a
slightly more involved&nbsp;example. In Figure 21.7 below, we see an
example of how the precedence of  open&nbsp;garage door  must occur
before the next two separate events can begin or reach&nbsp;completion.
In other words, for event 4 to take place (the beginning of
the&nbsp;precedence's get the car out and get the bike out); the prior
precedence  open garage&nbsp;door  must take place. When a task must be
completed before other tasks can begin, that task is said to be a&nbsp;<i>dependency</i>&nbsp;task,
or&nbsp;<i>predecessor&nbsp;</i>task. According to Reiss, the</span></p>

<p><span>completion
of events like 5 &amp; 6,  get the bike out  and  get the car out , are
dependent upon the task  open garage door , and therefore follow  open garage
door . These succeeding tasks are independent of each other in the diagram. In
other words, they can be accomplished independently of each other (provided the
same person is not accomplishing both tasks) (Reiss: 50). Tasks that are
independent of each other can be performed simultaneously if adequate resources
are available.</span></p>

<p><span><img border="0" width="293" height="121" src="afh1_files/image393.png" ></span><b><span>Figure 21.7. The Precedence or Task Expanded</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span><span>21.17.12. According to
Reiss, we can also estimate the amount&nbsp;of time which we think each
task will take, and this amount of&nbsp;time we call the duration of the
task. When a network diagram&nbsp;is drawn containing nodes connected by
tasks labeled with&nbsp;durations, the time each task should happen can
be calculated&nbsp;by adding up the durations of the various routes
contained&nbsp;within a network. Normally one of these routes will take
longer&nbsp;than the other routes. The longest route is referred to as
the&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><i><span>critical path.&nbsp;</span></i><span>The completions of the tasks along the critical
path are vital to the success of the project, for if any one of</span></p>

<p><sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup><span>those tasks becomes delayed for some reason, the
entire project will also be delayed. For example, Figure 21.8 illustrates a
network diagram with multiple routes and .activity arrows labeled with task
completion times.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.12.1. The critical
path is indicated in bold (A, C, E, G, I) along the route with the longest
total completion times. If the tasks between A and C, C and E, E and G, or G
and I should take longer than the time indicated, the total length of time for
the entire project will be delayed. Hence, this&nbsp;<i>critical path&nbsp;</i>is
vital to task completion, so the tasks along this path should receive the most
attention during the length of the project.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.13.
As indicated earlier by Reiss, squares can be used to represent these events,
or nodes. Performance evaluation and review technique makes use of squares to
illustrate network analysis (Reiss: 49). In Figure 21.9 below in the network
diagram of Figure 21.8 is formatted in performance evaluation and review
technique.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.14.
The critical path is identified by the bold-faced box borders and the arrows
that lead into and out of them. As you can see from the upper left box labeled
XYZ PROJECT, the project is to take 22 days, assuming the critical path
durations do not change (Task 1.1 of 5 days + Task 1.3 of 5 days + Task 1.6 of
7 days + Task 1.9 of 4 days + Project Review of 1 day = 22 days). Whether you
choose, network diagramming like that depicted in Figures 21.7 and 21.8 or a
Gantt chart is insignificant. The important thing to remember is that the tool
used should be simple to read and user friendly for your project. For the
purpose of the remainder of this reading, we will use a Gantt chart to
graphically depict further project discussions. Most project management
software packages make use of Gantt charts, but even if you do not have access
to project management software, Gantt charts can be easily constructed manually
in most word processing and spreadsheet programs. Figure 21.10 below is a Gantt
chart from a popular software package that depicts the information displayed previously
in Figures 21.8 &amp; 21.9.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.15. The critical
path in Figure 21.10 is identified by those tasks whose task names are larger,
bold-faced and underlined in the column labeled Task Name. As indicated
earlier, the critical path is vital to task completion, so the tasks along this
path should receive the most attention during the length of the project. Reiss
indicates that activities off the critical path have some freedom of movement
without affecting the overall project. These tasks are said to have float or
slack. The amount of float is the amount of time the activity can be delayed
without affecting the project overall. Critical tasks have no float, and may
become critical when their float is entirely consumed by the passage of time.
There are two types of float <i>free float&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>total
float.&nbsp;</i>Total float is what we have been talking about thus far the
amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the project's end date
(Reiss: 52). (NOTE: In the following examples, the Gantt chart depicted is for
a work schedule of Monday through Friday, with weekends being non-duty days.)
For example, in Figure 21.10 below, task 1.2 has 2 days of total float. Since
it is not along the critical path, if it was to be delayed by 2 days, it would
still not cause task 1.6 to be delayed from occurring; thus, its delay would
not affect the critical path or the project. Free float is the amount of time a
task can be delayed without affecting any tasks at all. Task 1.2 causes the
delay of task 1.4; therefore, it has no free float because a delay of this task
affects another task. However, task 1.4 has free float for if it was delayed by
as much as 2 days, its delay would not have any effect on the accomplishment of
another task. Why? Because task 1.3 must be accomplished before tasks 1.5, 1.6,
and 1.7 can occur. Since task 1.3 is 5 days and 1.4 is 3 days, if 1.4 was to
start 2 days late and still finish in 3 days, it would not hold up the tasks,
which are also waiting on the completion of task 1.3. That extra 2 days is called
task 1.4's free float. Float (or slack) is a concept which is very beneficial
to a project manager. For example, suppose task 1.3 (a critical task) was
accomplished by a team of folks. If a couple of team members were unable to
perform for some reason (emergency leave, hospitalization, etc.), task 1.4
could be delayed and personnel from the team accomplishing that task could be
used for task 1.3. Another possibility might be that computers used for
accomplishment of task 1.3 have failed and task 1.4 could be delayed to permit
the computer resources to be used for task 1.3. Knowledge of task duration,
resources to accomplish the task, and float available for tasks can enable a
project manager to make sound decisions to keep the project on schedule or to even
shorten the time required to complete the project.</span></p>

<p><span>21.17.16.
There is a multitude of information available on project management. We have
attempted to introduce you to some of the terminology, expound on some project
management principles, and illustrate practical uses of project management
principles. Remember, project management and program management are not the
same thing. Unlike a program, a project is temporary, not ongoing. Project
management is the process of leading and managing processes and people in the
pursuit of achieving project objectives. The steps of project management
include defining the problem, developing solution options, planning the
project, executing the plan, monitoring and controlling progress, and closing
the project. Project objectives should be SMART   specific, measurable,
action-oriented, realistic, and time-limited. For project management, the
primary constraints are quality, time, and cost. Of these three constraints,
one of them will likely be the driver for a project. The driver of a project
will have an impact on the other constraints affecting the project. As a
project manager, you must remain constantly aware of the driver and how it
impacts the other constraints of the project. With the constraints in mind, it
is imperative for the project manager to provide sound leadership and
management to develop the solution options necessary to achieve the project
objective. Once options are developed, the most important and time-consuming
aspect of project management must occur planning the project. Planning a
project involves activities that answer the questions who, what, when, where,
and how. Techniques of special importance to use during planning are a work
breakdown schedule, task analysis, and scheduling. Scheduling is accomplished
in a number of ways, to include Gantt charts, critical path method, and
performance evaluation and review technique. Gantt, critical path method, and
performance evaluation and review technique are methods used for network
analysis. Critical path method and performance evaluation and review technique
use a common convention called activity on arrow, or precedence. Regardless of
the method used, the route contained in the diagram depicting the longest duration
is referred to as the critical path. The completion of the tasks along the
critical path is vital to the success of the project, and failure of any one of
those tasks to be completed on time results in a delay to project completion.
The activities of some tasks off the critical path have some freedom of
movement without affecting the overall project. These tasks are said to have
float or slack; the two types of float are total float and free float. Total
float is the amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the
project's end.</span></p>

<p><b><span>21.18. Conclusion .</span></b></p>

<p><span>Organizational
management is the process of organizing, planning, leading, and controlling
resources within an entity with the overall aim of achieving its objectives.
Organizational management provides leaders the ability to make decisions and
resolve issues in order to be both effective and beneficial. This chapter
provided valuable information leaders need to effectively manage their
organizations. This chapter covered Organizational Design, Managing
Organizational change, conflict, problem solving, and project management.<b>&nbsp;</b></span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p align="center"><span>&nbsp;<b>Chapter 22</b></span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>HUMAN RESOURCE
DEVELOPMENT</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 22A Power</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>22.1. Introduction</span></b><span>:</span></p>

<p><span>22.1.1. The concept of
power in the workforce has a negative connotation and brings to mind such associations
as coercion, manipulation, and even corruption. This does not have to be the
case. Power has many positive aspects, and everyone can learn to explore and
harness different sources of the individual power they have in the workplace.
By developing their own sources of power, employees will be less dependent on
others for the leadership they need, and thus be better able to take initiative
and make greater contributions in their jobs.</span></p>

<p><span>22.1.2. Develop your own
program called&nbsp;<i>Situational Self Leadership</i>, and take a different
perspective on power. Develop an understanding that  the sole advantage of
power is the ability to do more good.  Thus, if you want to do more good for
yourself and more good for the people around you, it is important to learn how
to tap into your own points of power.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.2. Aspects of Power:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Position
power&nbsp;</b>is inherent in the authority of the position you have. You have
position power when your business card has a title printed on it that indicates
you have the power to manage people or command resources. My dad, an officer in
the Navy, used to say,  The best leaders are those who have position power and
never have to use it. </span></p>

<p><span>22.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Task
power</b>&nbsp;is power that stems from being good at a particular task at work
and being able to help others with a process or procedure they may need to do.</span></p>

<p><span>22.2.3.<b>&nbsp;Personal power&nbsp;</b>comes
from your personal character attributes such as strength of character, passion,
inspiration, or a personal vision of the future. Personal power is further
enhanced by the strength of your interpersonal skills, such as your ability to
communicate well and to be persuasive with others.</span></p>

<p><span>22.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Relationship
power&nbsp;</b>comes from association with others through friendship, personal
understanding of a colleague, and cultivation of a relationship, nepotism, or
reciprocity (trading favors).</span></p>

<p><span>22.2.5.<b>&nbsp;Knowledge
power&nbsp;</b>is about having expertise in an area. This is often through
knowing a special skill or group of skills in your job, but is also evidenced
by having certain degrees or certifications indicating special training.
Knowledge power can often be transferred from job to job or from organization
to organization, and is a general type of power.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.3. Charting Your Points of Power:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.3.1. An enlightening
activity is to list a number of workplace situations or conditions where you
feel you have the power to influence outcomes or people. Next to each item,
categorize the type of power you have in that circumstance.</span></p>

<p><span>22.3.2. Now draw a
five-pointed star with ten hash marks from the center to the tip of each point.
From the center of the star, mark off the corresponding number of responses you
listed in your assessment of each type of power. The farthest hash mark you
indicate on each arm of the star becomes the new tip of that arm. Connect these
new points. The resulting graphic should be some semblance of a star, with
certain points having more emphasis and others having less. This will show you
your primary points of power at a glance.</span></p>

<p><span>22.3.3. If you want to
be a real star in the workplace, try to develop a strategy to balance the
points of power where you work. Some examples:</span></p>

<p><span>22.3.3.1. You have high
knowledge power due to expertise in analysis, and are often asked to analyze
situations and report your findings in meetings. However, you are weak in
personal power and your ability to communicate is poor. Your strategy might be
to take a presentation skills course or to ask someone to critique a
presentation before you give it to the group.</span></p>

<p><span>22.3.3.2. You have high
task power and need to present an idea to the head of your department, but are
somewhat weak in relationship power. Your strategy could be to ask a coworker
who has the ear of the department head to give you feedback on how he or she
thinks the department head will react to your idea.</span></p>

<p><span>22.3.3.3. You have task
power and are working on a very visible project, but you lack position power,
which might make it difficult to get support. Your strategy could be to use
your task power to solicit a sponsor or champion who will help promote your
project and your credibility.</span></p>

<p><span>22.3.3.4. You have
personal power, but are weak in relationship power. Your strategy might be to
use your social skills to network. Ask others for instructions, attend meetings
of professional organizations, or schedule lunches to help build relationships.</span></p>

<p><span>22.3.4. Take advantage
of the points of power where you are strong. Use your power in a positive way
to do more good for yourself and those around you. If people throughout your
organization are enabled to develop their sources of power, it could create a
more even playing field for everyone. Power doesn t have to be concentrated in
the hands of a few.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 22B Unit Morale</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>22.4. Contemporary Motivation:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.4.1. Contemporary
motivation is a simple, three-phased approach to motivation. This approach
states that people can be in one of three levels of commitment to the
organization the membership level (at the lowest end), the performance level,
or the involvement level (highest level). A person's level of commitment determines
how motivated he or she is to accomplish the mission. The more committed a
person is to the organization, the more involved he or she is in the
organization. Supervisors can help to ensure the proper rewards are provided so
individuals can move to, or remain in, a higher commitment level.</span></p>

<p><span>22.4.2. Are methods
available to measure unit morale or motivation levels? Yes. For instance, the
Inspector General uses a climate assessment instrument to assess a unit s
morale. Mark Alexander, author of the article,&nbsp;<i>Organizational Norms,
The 1977 Annual Handbook for Group Facilitators</i>&nbsp;(1977), defines a set
of organizational norms and maintains that identifying and evaluating
organizational norms will result in a morale score. He identified 10 norms
categories, but we will only examine seven. Paragraph 22.5 is an excerpt from
the article and norms survey.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.5. Organizational Norms.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Within any
organizational situation, behavioral forces influence individual effectiveness
and job satisfaction. To a certain extent, these forces are a result of
organization requirements that people behave and act in certain ways, that they
hold certain values and sentiments, and that they interact with others in a
particular manner.</span></p>

<p><span>22.5.1.<b>&nbsp;Required and Emergent Behavior.</b></span></p>

<p><span>An organization s
required behavior, sentiments, and interactions are not necessarily in effect.
Existent or emergent behaviors, sentiments, and interactions, in many cases,
have a much greater influence on organization life than required behavior.
Emergent behavior correspondingly affects productivity, individual
satisfaction, and personal development. Behavioral scientists generally
recognize that emergent organizational behavior is determined largely by
formation of working group behavioral norms.</span></p>

<p><span>22.5.1.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Norms
are desirable behaviors. They are considered acceptable behavior as prescribed
by work groups and, in the larger context, by society and its institutions.
There are numerous examples throughout work and everyday life of emergent
behavior and the underlying norms that cause this behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>22.5.1.2. In the work
environment, a tendency to establish start and quit times that vary from
company policy, or a work group's inclination to establish a quicker or slower
pace than required are two often-cited examples. Outside the work situation,
normative (or emergent) behavior also occurs, and can be observed in schools,
institutions, or anywhere that people come together and interact for a period
of time.</span></p>

<p><span>22.5.2.<b>&nbsp;Positive
or Negative Norms.&nbsp;</b>From the organization's view, norms can be positive
or negative. Recent studies on organizational norms indicate that they can be
broken into categories, and that certain types or clusters of positive or
negative norms can exist in a given work situation. 22.5.2.1. Positive norms
are those that support the organization's goals and objectives and foster
behavior directed toward achieving those goals. Norms that support hard work,
loyalty, quality, and concern for customer satisfaction are examples of
positive norms.</span></p>

<p><span>22.5.2.2. Negative norms
have just the opposite effect. They promote behavior that works to prevent the
organization from achieving its objectives. Negative norms are those that
sanction criticism of the company, theft, absenteeism, and low levels of
productivity.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>22.6. Norm Categories:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.6.1.<b>&nbsp;Organizational
and Personal Pride.&nbsp;</b>Norms in this category are associated with an
individual's feelings of identification and sense of pride regarding the
organization. Positive norms lead the person to see the organization as  his 
or  hers.  Negative norms are reflected in a  we  and  they  attitude toward
the organization and its goals. Examples of positive and negative
organizational and personal pride norms are evident in the competition between
military organizations. If competition helps the units become better at their
missions and exhibit greater morale and motivation, then competition is
positive. On the other hand, if competition hampers the mission and leads to
reduced morale and motivation, competition is negative.</span></p>

<p><span>22.6.2.<b>&nbsp;Teamwork and Communication.</b></span></p>

<p><span>These norms are
reflected in the visible behaviors where individuals work together (cooperate).
Negative norms foster individuality, secrecy, and the belief that success is
achieved by an attitude of  every man for himself. &nbsp; Positive norms
promote sharing of information and working together to achieve common goals.
Thomas Jefferson noted that a candle loses nothing when it lights another
candle; that is the real nature of partnership and teamwork: give freely of
yourself and you will be rewarded with abundance. Promoting a positive norm is
even more critical as all military branches and government agencies work
together to counter global threats and to combat terrorism at home and abroad.</span></p>

<p><span>22.6.3.<b>&nbsp;Leadership and Supervision.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Leadership norms can
enhance or hinder effective supervision. Negative norms cause supervisors to
assume more active roles, like constantly policing and monitoring Airmen.
Positive norms result in supervisors assuming the role of subordinate helpers,
trainers, and developers.</span></p>

<p><span>22.6.4.<b>&nbsp;Profitability and Cost
Effectiveness.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This group of norms
determines people's behavior with respect to profit and cost consciousness.
Positive norms encourage people to save money and reduce costs; negative norms
foster a lack of concern for bottom line performance. You may have heard
someone say  it's good enough for government work.  That is a negative norm
that has been perpetuated over the years, but is one our Air Force cannot
afford if we are to effectively accomplish our mission of defending the United
States and protecting its interests through superior air and space power.</span></p>

<p><span>22.6.5.<b>&nbsp;Customer Relations.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Norms in this group
result in individual behavior that affects the manner in which a customer is
served. Positive norms are directed toward maximizing customer satisfaction.
Negative norms lead to viewing the customer as an obstacle to be avoided. Air
Force basic doctrine tells us the Air Force's air and space core competencies
are recognized by our joint  customers.  In other words, the total force, joint
force, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and others rely on us to do our job
to the best of our ability. If we do not, we cannot fight and win our Nation s
wars as we are expected to. Therefore, each organization must cultivate a
culture that helps our Airmen, Soldiers, Marines, and Sailors develop a
positive customer relations norm to ensure our Nation can meet any challenge in
the most effective manner.</span></p>

<p><span>22.6.6.<b>&nbsp;Innovativeness and Creativity.</b></span></p>

<p><span>This group of norms
determines, to a large degree, whether original and creative behaviors are
supported and encouraged. Positive norms lead to the stimulation of new ideas
and to positive change. Negative norms support the status quo and discourage
experimentation. In today's total and joint forces environment, we must
encourage everyone to bring innovativeness and creativity to the table in order
to meet the dynamic threats that terrorism has brought to our shores.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>22.6.7.<b>&nbsp;Training and Development.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Positive norms in this
group encourage training and view development as essential to the ongoing
operation. Negative norms treat development as a nonessential, nice-to-do, but
not critical aspect of the operation. We saw firsthand during Hurricane Katrina
that training is vitally important to the Department of Homeland Security, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
and other natural disaster responders. In addition, Airmen are constantly
training with soldiers, sailors, and marines to ensure each branch is better
equipped and prepared to fight the global war on terrorism.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>22.7. Why We Measure Norms:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.7.1. Understanding
that norms exist, that they can be either positive (supportive of
organizational goals) or negative (incongruent with organizational goals), and
that they can be categorized drives the need to measure those norms and develop
a normative profile.</span></p>

<p><span>22.7.2. In effect, a
normative profile is a statement of organizational strengths and weaknesses on
a behavioral level.</span></p>

<p><span>Understanding their
impact on an organization's ability to achieve its goals, you should direct
improvement programs toward changing work group norms rather than individual
behavior (as is so often the case with organizations' development programs).
Once norms change, behavioral change should follow. If a military member s
behavior does not support positive organizational norms, the supervisor needs
to determine the underlying reasons. The individual's behavior could be a
result of unmet needs, a result of discipline problems, or both. In order to be
effective operational managers and expeditionary leaders, supervisors must
learn to instill positive norms to properly motivate and discipline Airmen.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section
22C Transactional Analysis (TA)</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>22.8. Introduction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.8.1. "I'm
OK-----You're OK" is a euphemism for Transactional Analysis, also called
TA. To some, TA is a nonverbal reaction to communication between husband and
wife or parents and children. However, TA is much more than that and can be
applied to a business, industrial, or military organization.</span></p>

<p><span>22.8.2. TA is a theory
of personality as well as a systematic psychotherapy for personal growth and
personal change. As TA evolves, this reaction to communication is finding a
wide application in organizations and education. TA principles and techniques
is used by managers to more fully understand themselves and their relationships
with others, which can lead to them becoming happier, healthier, and more
productive. TA can be defined by several principles, such as, Ego States,
Transactions, Life Positions, Strokes, and Time Structuring. These principles
can be utilized to form techniques to improve individual productivity that, in
turn, can lead to increased organizational effectiveness.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.9. Ego States:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.9.1. One area of TA
is the study of individual&nbsp;<i>ego states</i>. We all know, without being
told, that we are different. The underlying theory of TA is the highlighting of
those differences. According to Dr. Eric Berne in his book,&nbsp;<i>Games
People Play,&nbsp;</i>TA analysis states that a human personality is composed
of ego states commonly referred to as&nbsp;<i>Parent, Adult,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Child&nbsp;</i>(PAC).
Each ego state is relatively separate from the others and each has its own set
of feelings, beliefs, and behavior patterns. Generally, people act in one ego
state at a time. In some cases, people may act in two ego states at the same
time. The states are produced by the playback of recorded data of past events
involving real people, real times, real places, and real feelings. (Beme:
23-28)</span></p>

<p><span>22.9.2. Another expert
on this subject, Dr. Thomas Harris, does an excellent job of writing about
these ego states in his book,&nbsp;<i>I'm</i>&nbsp;<i>OK You re OK.&nbsp;</i>He
says the Parent ego state is a way of thinking, acting, feeling, and believing
much the same as our parents and is based upon the brain's recordings of our
perceptions of our parents' responses. As such, the Parent ego state responds
immediately and automatically to childlike behavior. The Parent can be a&nbsp;<i>critical&nbsp;</i>Parent
or an overly&nbsp;<i>nurturing&nbsp;</i>Parent. (Harris: 40-46) Dr. Arnold
Kambly in his booklet,&nbsp;<i>The ABC's of PAC: An Introduction to
Transactional Analysis,&nbsp;</i>refers to the Parent as the taught concepts of
life. "We were taught this behavior from watching authority figures in our
early childhood." (Harris: I)</span></p>

<p><span>22.9.3. Dr. Harris says
the Child ego contains our basic desires and needs, and the recordings of the
feelings and reactions of our childhood. Oddly enough, this state develops
about the same time as the Parent state. The spontaneous dimensions of the
Child provide for the joy, motivation, and natural creativity of one's own
personality. "Adopted elements of the Child are expressed in feelings and
patterns of response to parental stimuli`<b>&nbsp;</b>responses such as
rebellion, procrastination, or compliance." (Harris: 47-50) Dr. Kambly
refers to this ego state as "the felt concept of life. These are the
feelings we have recorded from childhood." (Kambly: I-2) These feelings
bring forth our emotions and desires for emotion in others.</span></p>

<p><span>22.9.4. According to Dr.
Harris, the third state, the Adult ego state, is a way of acting, feeling, and
believing that is rather objective. The Adult part of our personality develops
later than either that of the Parent or the Child, and continues to develop
throughout the lifetime of a healthy person and is the analytical part of our
personality that processes current and objective information about our
environment. The Adult also edits our archaic recordings in the Parent and
Child parts of personality. (Harris: 50-59) Dr. Kambly says the Adult deals with
the realities of the world, plus input from the Parent and Child. The Adult
deals with the "here and now," in contrast to the other two ego
states which come from the past. (Kambly: 3)  The Adult is the learned concept
of life. In this case, learned in the Adult is different than the taught of the
Parent." (Kambly: 3) Learned refers to a continuous process. The Adult is
always learning. The taught Parent ego state was taught once, in the past.</span></p>

<p><span>22.9.5. The three ego
states appear in our behavior at different times. According to Dr. Harris, a
healthy individual maintains a balance among the three. However, some people
may be dominated by one of the ego states. This is&nbsp;<i>contamination.&nbsp;</i>(Harris:&nbsp;
123-140). According to Dr. Kambly, "contamination takes place when the
Parent or Child contaminates the Adult." The Adult makes the decisions,
but these decisions are then distorted due to the past tapes of the Parent or
Child. Dr. Harris and Dr. Kambly agree that such people have been known to
create problems for managers who have to work with them. People with
Childdominated personalities generally do not engage in much rational problem
solving. They can be hard to reason with in emotionally charged situations
because these people have learned through earlier experiences that they can
succeed by being loud, boisterous, or emotional. Parent-dominated people also
do not engage in much rational problem solving because they already know what
is right and what is wrong. They are overly critical or overly nurturing. Another
problem is&nbsp;<i>exclusion.&nbsp;</i>This happens when one ego state excludes
the others. In this situation, the excluding ego state pushes out the excluded
ego states. Dr. Kambly points out that "a healthy person has the ego
states separate and discrete. When things go wrong, contamination or exclusion
results." (Kambly: 45)</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.10. Life Position:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.10.1. Along with ego
states, the term&nbsp;<i>life</i>&nbsp;<i>position&nbsp;</i>is associated with
TA. Simply stated, life position is how a person feels about oneself and about
other people. In the process of growing up, people make some rather basic
assumptions about themselves and about others in their environment. The
combination of assumptions about oneself and about others is referred to as a
life position. Important to state is that the life position has two parts: the
feelings of self and feelings toward others. This is different than
self-concept or self-esteem, which only deal with self. Life positions tend to
be more permanent than ego states. This permanency can create potential
problems in an organizational setting where people work together even if their
life positions are not complementary. Life positions result from reinforcement
received throughout life from expressions of need and responses to expressed
needs.</span></p>

<p><span>22.10.2.
The focus of the book by Dr. Harris (<i>I'm</i>&nbsp;<i>OK you re OK)&nbsp;</i>is
on these life positions. "The assumptions are described in terms of
"okayness." Thus, individuals are labeled either OK or not OK,
whether they refer to themselves or to someone else. OK and not OK equate to
value and individual worth. Thus, there are four possible life positions:"
(Harris:</span></p>

<p><span>66)</span></p>

<p><span>22.10.2.1. I'm not
OK You are not OK = neither of us has value (- -).</span></p>

<p><span>22.10.2.2.
I'm not OK You are OK = I don't have value; you have value (- +). 22.10.2.3.
I'm OK You are not OK = I have value; you don't have value (+ -).</span></p>

<p><span>22.10.2.4. I'm OK You
are OK = We both have value (+ +).</span></p>

<p><span>22.10.3. The fourth life
position is ideal because most people with these feelings tend to have a
positive outlook on life and are generally successful.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.11. Transactions and Strokes:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.11.1. According to
Dr. Eric Heme, "a situation which results in social intercourse is dubbed
a transaction." (Beme: 29)&nbsp; If two or more people encounter each
other in a social interaction, sooner or later one of them will speak, or give
some indication of acknowledging the presence of the others. Dr. Heme calls
this the&nbsp;<i>transactional stimulus</i>. Another person says or does
something related to this stimulus, and that action is called the transactional
response. Therefore, simple TA is concerned with diagnosing which ego states
are used in the transaction (stimulus and response). Transactions may involve
combinations of ego states and match or replay forms of interactions that
develop early in life. Simple transactions are those in which both stimulus and
response arise from the Adult states of the parties concerned. These are&nbsp;<i>parallel&nbsp;</i>or
c<i>omplementary.&nbsp;</i>Also, Child to Parent transactions (and vice versa)
is complementary. Complementary means the responses are both appropriate and
expected. Some transactions are not complementary. The responses are not
expected or appropriate. For example, an Adult-to-Adult stimulus followed by a
Child to Parent response is not complementary and is called a&nbsp;<i>crossed&nbsp;</i>transaction.
These occur when a respondent reacts from an ego state other than the one
desired by the initiator. Crossed transactions can cause problems, but they
also have a use as you'll see later. Analyzing the transactions to determine
the ego states can help determine the life position. As long as transactions
remain complementary, communication continues regardless of the content of the
transaction. On the other hand, communication ceases as a result of crossed
transactions. Dr. Berne's research and experience tell us that crossed
transactions are barriers to effective communication and negatively impact the
motivation of people, which ultimately results in decreased output.</span></p>

<p><span>22.11.2. Consider the
following example: The supervisor states, "Staff Sergeant Jones, could you
come to a meeting in my office around 1300 today?" Staff Sergeant Jones
replies, "Sure." This is an Adult transaction. Communication could
continue and the supervisor could say, "Good. I'd like you to brief that
idea you submitted to the rest of the staff I really think it will work."
On the other hand, Staff Sergeant Jones could have said, "Oh come on, I've
already got enough work to do around here. I don't want to sit through another
boring meeting." In this case, Staff Sergeant Jones is responding
emotionally and not from the Adult ego state. Therefore, effective
communication is blocked.</span></p>

<p><span>22.11.3. Another type of
transaction is called a&nbsp;<i>stroke.&nbsp;</i>A stroke is a special form of
recognition that one person gives to another. Strokes can&nbsp;<i>positive&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<i>negative,&nbsp;</i>and
are common in any organization.</span></p>

<p><span>22.11.4. According to
Dr. Kambly, positive strokes can be verbal, nonverbal, or physical. They are
designed to make the person feel good. They are a type of reward. They can be
conditional, which means they are based on a certain condition being met.
Telling a worker, "Hey Staff Sergeant Jones, you did a great job putting
together the training report." is an example of a positive conditional
stroke. Positive conditional strokes modify behavior in that they try to get the
person to continue the behavior. Positive strokes can also be unconditional. An
unconditional stroke is not based on any condition and is given just for&nbsp;<i>being,&nbsp;</i>not
for&nbsp;<i>doing.&nbsp;</i>Smiling at someone and telling them you're glad to
have them as part of the team is a positive unconditional stroke. Positive
unconditional strokes are designed to make the person feel good about
themselves. Positive unconditional strokes improve selfesteem, which can help
lead to a better life position.</span></p>

<p><span>22.11.5. Dr. Kambly also
reviews the negative<i>&nbsp;</i>strokes people use. Negative strokes are
designed to make the person feel bad. They are a type of punishment or rebuke.
Just like positive strokes, negative stokes can be conditional or
unconditional. A negative conditional stroke is used to modify behavior in that
it is used to get the person to stop the behavior. Issuing a reprimand or
Article 15 is an example. The act (condition) resulted in the negative
conditional stroke. A negative unconditional stroke is aimed at the person,
just like the positive unconditional stroke and is an attack against the person
and not any specific behavior. Slamming a person, putting them down, or calling
them names are all examples of negative unconditional strokes. In professional
relationships, there is never a need to use negative unconditional strokes.</span></p>

<p><span>22.11.6. Dr. Harris
identifies different stroking with the different life positions. He has found
that "people of unhealthy life positions tend to overuse certain types of
strokes." (Harris: 67- 77) For example, an "I'm OK You're not
OK" person may overuse negative strokes. The reason is obvious. This
person thinks they are so much better than everyone else, and they may operate
from the critical Parent ego state. On the other hand, an "I'm not OK You're
OK" person may overuse positive strokes. This person sees others as so
much better than they are. A problem with overusing positive strokes is that
the strokes become plastic or meaningless. If the supervisor is always using
them, his or her praise becomes meaningless.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.12. Time Structuring.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Another aspect of TA
deals with&nbsp;<i>time structuring.&nbsp;</i>According to Dr. Kambly, "if
a person lives to be 75 years old, assuming he or she sleeps 8 hours out of
every 24, he or she has approximately 50 waking years to spend in some type of
time structuring." (Kambly: 9) Dr. Heme states there are several options
for a person. These are: Withdrawal, Rituals, Activities, Pastimes, Games, and
Intimacy. (Beme: 18-19) A summary of each of these, as taken from Dr. Kambly's
booklet, is below.</span></p>

<p><span>22.12.1.<b>&nbsp;Withdrawal.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>This
involves no risk and has minimal social rewards because there is minimal
contact. A person does not have to be alone to be in withdrawal. They can be
"lost in the crowd." Withdrawal is not always bad. We all need to get
away and relax or be alone at times. However, if this is the primary way a
person structures their time, it becomes a problem. This can be dangerous if a
person uses it all the time. Some people can be withdrawn prior to suicide.</span></p>

<p><span>22.12.2.<b>&nbsp;Rituals.</b>&nbsp;Rituals
are highly structured and predictable ways to structure time. This can be as
simple as walking down the hall and saying, "Hi Jim. How are you
today?" Jim then replies, "Hi. I'm fine." This is done out of
habit and is predictable. You may not really care how Jim is, and Jim may not
actually be "fine." Rituals are okay at times, but if this is all a
person does, this is not productive in the work center. Rituals are just small
talk about things of little value. So, a person who spends most of their time
in rituals does not contribute as much to the work center. Rituals are slightly
riskier than withdrawal because there is some interaction. However, the risk is
minimal because of the structured and predictable nature of rituals.</span></p>

<p><span>22.12.3.<b>&nbsp;Activities.&nbsp;</b>These
are goal oriented. Activities are things people do to meet mission requirements
or goals. They are production orientated. This is where the majority of time
should be spent in the work center. People with a healthy life position can
spend a lot of time in activities and they expect others to be goal-oriented
(activity-centered) also.</span></p>

<p><span>22.12.4.<b>&nbsp;Pastimes.</b>&nbsp;Pastimes
are ways to structure time, such as hobbies, for relaxation. Things we do
without a specific goal in mind are all pastimes. Pastimes and activities can
be confused. You need to look at the intent of the time structuring. For
example, someone playing golf for fun is structuring their time doing a
pastime. However, if they are a professional golfer and make money at it, they
are engaged in activities. The risk is a bit higher for activities and pastimes
than it is for rituals or withdrawal because there are more chances of
interaction and more chances for values and differences of opinion to come into
play. There are more meaningful transactions during activities and pastimes.</span></p>

<p><span>22.12.5.<b>&nbsp;Games.</b>&nbsp;Games
are a way to structure time in devious or crooked ways to get strokes (which
are normally negative). Games are not productive and they result in anger,
frustration, jealousy, etc. The risks in games are high because of the anger
and hurt feelings that result. Those with unhealthy life positions normally
play games. Games, like poor communication, often tend to create organizational
problems. A basic understanding of the term&nbsp;<i>games&nbsp;</i>is essential
to the application of TA in management. In his book&nbsp;<i>Games People
Play,&nbsp;</i>Dr. Berne refers to a game as "a recurring set of
transactions, often repetitious, superficially plausible, with a concealed
motivation." (Berne: 48) These types of transactions can be of a type
called&nbsp;<i>ulterior,&nbsp;</i>meaning there is a hidden or ulterior meaning
to the transaction. Basically, games are transactions that are designed to
cause an emotional response such as anger or hurt. A game might be as simple as
an "I'm not OK You're OK" person speaking from the Child ego state
trying to get others to be the nurturing Parent. Some games get more complex
and can even result in death. Given this definition, games become barriers
preventing people and organizations from achieving their objectives. Games tend
to inhibit full productivity. Using crossed transactions (responding always
from your Adult when the game-player is using the Child or Parent) will reduce
game-playing. For example, assume someone says, "That's the dumbest idea
I've ever heard of. What moron came up with that?" This person is being a
critical Parent and not presenting any facts to support the point of view.
Using your Adult, you could reply, "What parts of the idea do you find
flawed?" or "Can you provide specific data to support your opinion?"
These replies use the Adult to seek facts and to focus the person on the&nbsp;<i>here
and now.</i></span></p>

<p><span>22.12.6.<b>&nbsp;Intimacy.</b>&nbsp;This
is the most risky, but also the most rewarding type of time structuring and is
defined as a close relationship with others free of games and exploitation.
Intimacy is being open, honest, and sincere and requires a person at the
"I'm OK You're OK" life position. Intimacy is not just sexual
relationships. A person can have sexual relationships and be in a state of
withdrawal or ritual. Intimacy is a close personal relationship, and that's why
the risk and reward are high.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.13. The Work Environment:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.13.1. We can now
relate the concepts of TA to the environmental process. How do basic concepts
of TA apply in business, industrial, or military environments? The most basic
application of TA principles is to managerial styles. TA is a powerful tool
that can help managers understand the interactive nature of human problems in a
work environment so<i>&nbsp;</i>that they can deal with these problems more
effectively. Does the supervisory relationship indicate the need for a
participative or an authoritarian management style, or does the need indicate
another point along the continuum? For an authoritarian style, or&nbsp;<i>Theory
X</i>&nbsp;management, to work effectively, the manager has to operate as a
Parent while workers operate in the Child state. Supervisors have absolute
authority while workers are very dependent on direction from above. Thus, the
boss is OK but workers are not OK. In this situation, the manager accepts final
responsibility for failure. Being dependent, much like a Child, the worker in
this situation is protected from making a wrong decision because the boss takes
full responsibility for all actions.</span></p>

<p><span>22.13.2. There is
another view. According to Maslow, Herzberg, and other motivation theorists,
the authoritarian style of management frustrates achievement of the
higher-level needs of human personality. Therefore, a worker in this situation
may find it satisfactory, but may never experience a state of self-fulfillment
and growth. A common belief among casual observers is that the condition just
described is common in many organizations. The participative or&nbsp;<i>Theory
Y&nbsp;</i>management style involves Adult-Adult transactions. A two-way flow
of communication exists and the worker feels more comfortable in providing his
or her input. Subordinates feel a sense of responsibility rather than a feeling
of dependency. Because workers influence decisions and share responsibility,
they experience a feeling of fulfillment. The corresponding life position is
likely I'm OK You're OK.</span></p>

<p><span>22.13.3. A potential
exists for crossed transactions in any management setting. In the authoritarian
approach, the supervisor may be comfortable in the Parent ego state, but the
worker may not enjoy the Child state. The worker may want to operate in the
Adult state, and rightfully so. In this situation, Parent-to-Adult
communication is disturbed and an unsettled situation occurs. The worker
becomes frustrated, leading to unproductive behavior and performance not a
healthy situation for any organization. Thus, a manager with an understanding
of TA, and with knowledge of worker ego states based on observation, could
possibly head off this type of situation.</span></p>

<p><span>22.13.4. Crossed
transactions are also possible while using a participative management style. By
its very nature, this style encourages employee ego involvement in on-the-job
activities. Individuals identify closely with work units and jobs because they
are involved in establishing policies and operating procedures. However, even
in this style, instances often occur when policies are established and
decisions are rendered with rule or no employee involvement a simple exercise
of management prerogative. Such cases provide a fertile ground for crossed
transactions when disgruntled employees confront individual managers. Here, the
potential is high for responses from the Parent ego state, and the opportunity
for conflict exists. Therefore, a skilled manager with an understanding of TA,
and with knowledge of worker ego states based on observation, can avoid the
conflict by dealing with those situations from a complementary state.</span></p>

<p><span>22.13.5. TA has taken
hold as a supervisory tool. Initially, it was used mainly to teach employees
who deal with the public how to relate better to their customers. Later,
managers experimented with TA as a means of improving communications within the
company itself. This experimentation has encouraged and reinforced a team
concept. This is a participative management style whereby management and
workers share the responsibility for decision-making. Some management
practitioners view this as cooptation. In other words, it gives workers an
equitable "share of the pie.  The prevailing philosophy is that workers
take ownership for their behavior in supporting policies and following
procedures, which results in allowing more focus on productivity while
maintaining a high interpersonal working relationship. In TA terms, both
management and workers function in the Adult ego state. The resulting impact of
this condition on<b>&nbsp;</b>organizations is that the organization is OK.
Overall, it can be stated, "Together we are OK. The organization is OK =
We all have value."&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Summarizing life
positions and their relationship to management styles, one might view it in
terms of a management matrix similar to that depicted in Table 1.1.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.14. Conclusions:</span></b></p>

<p><span>22.14.1. Generally, what
has been the response to TA? Many executives, after having been exposed to TA
training, swear by it; others have not responded as well, and consider it just
another buzz word. TA is very difficult to evaluate objectively. Most
supervisors are more than willing to prescribe TA training for line employees,
but do not show much enthusiasm for applying TA concepts to themselves. Even
though there is skepticism, some supervisors have learned that TA is profitable
in terms of increasing organizational effectiveness. It's presented here as a
tool to add to your management tool box.</span></p>

<p><span>22.14.2. The application
of TA tracks well with the management theories of Likert, McGregor, and Argyris
because use of TA provides opportunities for individuals to grow and mature.
Even though some workers prefer to function in the Child state and appear to
avoid responsibility, most desire to be treated as adults and to be given more
responsibility. Using TA not only provides an opportunity for managers to know
their people, but it also helps them to get in touch with themselves. When all
parties involved are aware of each other's needs, communication improves. This
condition is essential to organizational effectiveness. The effective supervisor
focuses on workers' behavior and the modification of that behavior as a means
for improving the organizational climate, thereby ultimately increasing overall
productivity.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 22D Performance
Counseling</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>22.15. Performance Counseling.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Performance Counseling<i>&nbsp;</i>is<i>&nbsp;</i>a<i>&nbsp;</i>systematic,
two-way discussion between supervisor and subordinate concerning duty
performance as compared to established standards, with the intention of
informing the subordinate of his/her past duty performance and cooperatively
developing a plan to sustain or improve performance.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.16.</span></b><span>&nbsp;<b>The Lost Art of Feedback:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.1. The ability and
willingness to communicate effectively is the key to supervisory success.
Although communication effectiveness is based on the ability to make and maintain
effective contact, regardless of the situation, specific areas of communication
require some additional thought and planning.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.2. One of the most
important tools for maintaining control and developing people is the proper use
feedback. Although feedback has been categorized as positive and negative.
Another way to view this is to classify it into supportive feedback (which
reinforces an ongoing behavior) and corrective feedback (which indicates that a
change in behavior is appropriate). In this sense, all feedback is positive.
The purpose of all feedback should be to assist an individual in maintaining or
enhancing his or her present level of effectiveness or appropriateness.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.3. Some feedback,
by definition, is better than no feedback. There are, however, ways to do it
well and ways to do it superbly. Here are some guidelines that can help to
sharpen the process. The most important function of feedback is to help the
individual who is receiving the feedback to keep in touch with what is going on
in the environment.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.&nbsp;<b>Supportive Feedback:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.1. Supportive
feedback is used to reinforce behavior that is effective and desirable. An
axiom of effective supervision is "Catch them doing something right and
let them know it." (Blanchard &amp; Johnson, 1982)</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.2. One of the
most damaging and erroneous assumptions that many supervisors make is that good
performance and appropriate behavior are to be expected from the employee, and
that the only time feedback is needed is when the employee does something
wrong. Therefore, these supervisors never give supportive feedback. If a
supervisor was determined to give only one kind of feedback, he or she would be
ahead to choose supportive feedback and let corrective feedback go. In other
words, if a supervisor stresses errors only, the end result would be, at most,
an attempt by employees to do standard, error free work. This accomplishment
would not be bad, but there is a better way.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.3. If a
supervisor concentrated on what the employees were doing well, then superior
work is what the employees would become aware of. They would begin to view
their work in terms of performing as well and as creatively as possible. What
is reinforced has a tendency to become stronger. What is not reinforced has a
tendency to fade away. If excellence is actively reinforced and errors are
simply mentioned, employees will focus on excellence and tend to reduce errors.
The following example of the two types of feedback illustrates the difference.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.3.1.&nbsp;<b>Focus
on errors.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>"The last three pieces in that batch contained
wrong figures. We cannot have that kind of sloppy work in this
department."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.3.2.<i>&nbsp;</i><b>Focus
on good work<i>.</i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>This batch looks good, except for the last
three pieces, which contain wrong figures. You probably used the wrong formula.
Take them back and check them out, just the way you did the first group."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.4. Fortunately,
however, no one has to make a choice between using only supportive or only
corrective feedback.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.4.5. Both are
essential and valuable, and it is important to understand how each works so
that the maximum gain can be received from the process.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.5.&nbsp;<b>Corrective
Feedback.&nbsp;</b>Corrective feedback is used to alter a behavior that is
ineffective or inappropriate and is essential to the growth process as
supportive feedback. A corrective feedback session, although never hurtful if
done properly, is not a particularly pleasant experience. Under the best of
circumstances, the subordinate will probably feel a little defensive or embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.5.1. In giving
corrective feedback, the manager should have an option ready to present. When
the employee is made aware of the inappropriate behavior, having an immediate
alternative can be effective and powerful in shaping behavior. By presenting
the alternative immediately after the corrective feedback, the manager is
helping the subordinate to come out of a personally uncomfortable situation in
the shortest possible time. This protects the dignity of the subordinate. The
manager would also be establishing himself or herself as a supporter of good
work and good workers, which would go a long way in developing strong,
productive, supportive working relationships. Also very important, the manager
would be presenting an alternative that the employee might never have
considered or that was considered and rejected. This provides for immediate
learning. Most important, however, is the fact that the manager would make the
employee aware that an alternative was available at the time the employee chose
to act<b>&nbsp;</b>otherwise. This awareness can facilitate the employee in
taking responsibility for his or her own choices. That is, the employee would
realize, "That's right, I could have done it that way." The following
example shows how an alternative can be effectively added to the feedback.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.5.2. "When
you snapped at Ann in front of the group, she appeared to be very embarrassed
and angry. When you must remind an employee to be on time, it's less
embarrassing for everyone to discuss it with the employee privately after the
meeting."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.&nbsp;<b>Guidelines
for Effective Feedback.&nbsp;</b>The following guidelines are helpful for
managers who are trying to improve their feedback skills, and may also be used
as a review prior to giving feedback.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.1.&nbsp;<b>Deal in Specifics:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.1.1. Being
specific is the most important rule in giving feedback, whether supportive or
corrective. Unless the feedback is specific, very little learning or
reinforcement is possible. The following examples illustrate the difference in
general and specific statements.</span></p>

<p><i><span>General:&nbsp;</span></i><span>"I'm glad to see that your work is
improving."</span></p>

<p><i><span>Specific:&nbsp;</span></i><span>"I'm pleased that you met every deadline in
the last three weeks."</span></p>

<p><i><span>General:&nbsp;</span></i><span>"You're a very supportive
person."&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><i><span>Specific:&nbsp;</span></i><span>"I appreciate you taking time to explain
the contract to our new employee."</span></p>

<p><i><span>General:&nbsp;</span></i><span>"You're falling down on the job
again."</span></p>

<p><i><span>Specific:&nbsp;</span></i><span>"Last month most of the cost reports were
completely accurate, but last week your profit cost figures were wrong. </span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.1.2. The last
set is, of course, an example of corrective feedback. General statements in
corrective feedback frequently result in hostile or defensive confrontations,
whereas specific statements set the stage for problem-solving interaction.
Carrying the last illustration one step farther, the manager could add an
alternative: "Start checking the typed report against the computer
printouts. Some of the errors may be typos, not miscalculations."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.1.3. If the
employee is to learn from feedback and respond to it, then he or she must see it
in terms of&nbsp;<i>observable&nbsp;</i>effects. That is, the employee must be
able to see clearly how his or her behavior had a direct impact on the group's
performance, morale, etc. When the employee sees the point of the feedback
objectively, the issue will be depersonalized, and the employee will be more
willing to continue with appropriate behaviors or to modify inappropriate
behaviors. Although the manager's personal approval ( I'm glad to see...")
or disapproval ("I m disappointed that...") can give emphasis to feedback,
it must be supported by specific data in order to effect a change in behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.2.&nbsp;<b>Focus on Actions, Not
Attitudes:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.2.1. Just as
feedback must be specific and observable to be effective, it must be
non-threatening to be acceptable. Although subordinates, like supervisors, are
always accountable for their behavior<i>,&nbsp;</i>they are never accountable
for their attitudes or feelings. Attitudes and feelings cannot be measured, nor
can a manager determine if or when an employee's feelings have changed. For
feedback to be acceptable, it must respect the dignity of the person receiving
the feedback.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.2.2. No one can
attack attitudes without dealing in generalities, and frequently attacks on
attitudes result in defensive reactions. The following example illustrates the
difference in giving feedback on behavior and giving feedback on attitudes.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.2.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Feedback
on attitude:</b>&nbsp;"You have been acting hostile toward Jim."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.2.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Feedback
on behavior:</b>&nbsp;"You threw the papers down on Jim's desk and used
profanity."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.2.3. An attitude
that managers often try to measure is loyalty. Certain actions that seem to
indicate loyalty or disloyalty can be observed, but loyalty is a result, not an
action and cannot be demanded; it must be earned. Whereas people have total
control over their own behavior, they often exercise little control over their
feelings and attitudes. They feel what they feel. If a manager keeps this in
mind and focuses more energy on things that can be influenced (i.e. employee
behavior), changes are more likely to occur.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.2.4. The more
that corrective feedback is cast in specific behavioral terms, the more it
supports problemsolving and the easier it is to control. The more that
corrective feedback is cast in attitudinal terms, the more it will be perceived
as a personal attack and the more difficult it will be to deal with. The more
that supportive feedback is cast in terms of specific behaviors, the higher the
probability that those behaviors will be repeated and eventually become part of
the person's natural way of doing things.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.3.&nbsp;<b>Determine the Appropriate
Time and Place:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.3.1. Feedback of
either type works best if it is given as soon as feasible after the behavior
occurs. Waiting decreases the impact that the feedback will have on the
behavior. The passage of time may make the behavior seem less important to the
manager, other important events begin to drain the energy of the manager, and
some of the details of the behavior might be forgotten. On the other hand,
dwelling on it for a long period could blow it out of proportion. From the
subordinates' viewpoint, the longer the wait for the feedback, the less
important it must be. The following example illustrates this point.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.3.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Tardy
feedback:</b><i>&nbsp;</i>"You fell below your quota several times last
month."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.3.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Immediate
feedback:</b><i>&nbsp;</i>"There are only ten products here; your quota
for today was fourteen."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.3.2. Enough time
should be allotted to deal with the issues in their entirety. A manager can
undercut feedback effectiveness by looking at the clock and speeding up the
input so that an appointment can be met. Answering the telephone or allowing
visitors to interrupt the conversation can have the same effect. The manager
can also cause unnecessary stress by telling an employee at ten o'clock in the
morning "I want to see you at three this afternoon." A more
appropriate procedure would be to say, "Would you please come to my office
now," or "When you reach a stopping point, drop by my office. I have
something good to tell you." In addition to an appropriate time, the
setting is also important. The old proverb, "Praise in public, censure in
private," is partially correct. Almost without exception, corrective
feedback is more appropriately given in private. In the case of supportive
feedback, however, discretion is needed. In many instances, praise in public is
appropriate and will be appreciated by the subordinate. In other instances,
privacy is needed to keep the positive effect from being shortcircuited. For
example, some people make a virtue out of humility; any feedback that
reinforces their sense of worth is embarrassing. Rather than appreciating an
audience, this type of employee would find it painful and perhaps resent it.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.3.3. Sometimes a
norm arises in a work group that prevents anyone from making a big deal out of
good work. This does not mean that the group does not value good work, but
supportive feedback in private might prevent the employee from feeling he or
she was responsible for breaking the norm. In other instances, public praise
can cause jealousy, hostility, or tense working relationships. Therefore, a
conscious decision should be made about whether or not to give the supportive
feedback publicly.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.3.4. Another important
consideration is the actual location selected for giving the feedback. The
delivery of the feedback should match its importance. If the feedback concerns
an important action, the manager's office would be better than an accidental
encounter in the hall. On the other hand, the manager might convey a quick
observation by telling someone at the water fountain, "Say that was
beautiful artwork on the Madison report." Choosing the time and place is a
matter of mixing a little common sense with an awareness of what is going on.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.&nbsp;<b>Refrain from Inappropriately
Including Other Issues:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.1. Frequently
when feedback is given, other issues interfere. When supportive feedback is
given, any topic that does not relate to the specific feedback point should not
be discussed if it would undercut the supportive feedback. For example, the
manager could destroy the good just accomplished by adding, "And by the
way, as long as you are here, I want to ask you to try to keep your files a
little neater. While you were away, I couldn't find a thing."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.2. When
corrective feedback is given, however, the situation is different. The manager
will want the feedback to be absorbed as quickly and easily as possible, with
the employee's negative feelings lasting no longer than necessary. Therefore,
as soon as the feedback has been understood and acknowledged, the manager is
free to change the subject. The manager may want to add, "I'm glad that
you see where the error occurred. </span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.3.  Now, as
long as you are here, I'd like to ask your opinion about ..." This type of
statement, when used appropriately, lets the subordinate know that he or she is
still valued. Obviously, the manager should not contrive a situation just to
add this type of statement, but when the situation is naturally there, the
manager is free to take advantage of it.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.4. In certain
situations, it is appropriate to give supportive and corrective feedback
simultaneously. Training periods of new employees, performance-appraisal sessions,
and times when experienced employees are tackling new and challenging tasks are
all good examples of times when both types of feedback are appropriate.
Nevertheless, some cautions are necessary.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.5. Never
follow the feedback with the word "but." It will negate everything
that was said before it. If appropriate to give supportive and corrective
feedback within the same sentence, the clauses should be connected with
"and." This method allows both parts of the sentence to be heard
clearly and sets the stage for a positive suggestion. The following examples
illustrate the difference.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.5.1. Connected
with but: "Your first report was accurate, but your others should have
measured up to it."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.5.2. Connected
with and: "Your first report was accurate, and your others should have
measured up to it."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.5.3. Connected
with but: "You were late this morning, but Anderson called to tell you
what a great job you did on the Miller account."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.5.4. Connected
with and: "You were late this morning, and Anderson called to tell you
what a great job you did on the Miller account."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.6. Alternate
the supportive and corrective feedback. Better to mix the supportive feedback
with the corrective feedback than to give all of one type and then all of the
other when a great deal of feedback must be given. Regardless of which type
comes first, the latter will be remembered the most clearly. If a chronic
self-doubter is first given supportive feedback and then only corrective
feedback, he or she is likely to believe the supportive feedback was given just
to soften the blow of the other type. Alternating between the two types will
make all the feedback seem more genuine.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.6.4.7. Where
feasible, use the supportive feedback to cushion the corrective feedback. When
both types of feedback are appropriate, there is usually no reason to start
with corrective feedback. However, this does not mean that corrective feedback
should be quickly sandwiched in between supportive feedback statements. Each
type is important, but frequently supportive feedback can be used as an
excellent teaching device for areas that need correcting. This is especially
true if the employee has done a good job previously and then failed later under
similar circumstances. For example, the manager might say, "The way you
helped Fred to learn the codes when he was transferred to this department would
be appropriate in training the new employees."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.&nbsp;<b>Principles of Feedback:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1. Two major
principles govern the use of feedback. The first principle, which relates to
how feedback is conducted, can be paraphrased, "I can't tell you how you
are, and you can't tell me what I see." In other words, the person giving
the feedback is responsible to relate the situation as he or she observes it,
and the person receiving the feedback is responsible for relating what he or
she meant, felt, or thought. The second principle is that feedback supports
growth. Let's define what is meant by "I can't tell you how you are, and
you can't tell me what I see."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.1.<b>&nbsp;Receiving
Feedback</b><i>:&nbsp;</i>"You Can't Tell Me How I Am."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.1.1. From the
recipient's viewpoint, the first principle is "You can't tell me how I am,
and I can't tell you what you see." Although most people realize that giving
feedback correctly requires skill and awareness, they are less aware of the
importance of knowing how to receive feedback. When receiving feedback, many
people tend to argue about, disown, or attempt to justify the information.
Statements like "I didn't say that," "That's not what I
meant," and "You don't understand what I was trying to do," are
attempts to convince the person giving the feedback that he or she didn't see
or observe what he or she claims. However, the recipient needs to understand
that the observer, whether manager, peer, or subordinate, is relating what he
or she experienced as a result of the recipient's behavior. There is nothing
wrong with the giver and receiver having different viewpoints. The purpose of
feedback is to give a new<b>&nbsp;</b>view or to increase awareness. If an
argument ensues and the observer backs down, the recipient is the loser.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.<b>&nbsp;Giving
Feedback:</b><i>&nbsp;</i>"You Can't Tell Me What I See."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.1. The
object of giving feedback is not to judge the other person, but to report what
was seen and heard and what the effects of the behavior were. Personal approval
or disapproval, even if important, is secondary.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.2. Feedback
should be given directly to the person for whom it is intended. When others are
present, the manager sometimes addresses them almost to the exclusive of the
intended recipient, who sits quietly and gathers information by eavesdropping.
Good contact with the recipient is an essential element in giving feedback.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.3. Never
apologize for giving corrective feedback. Corrective or otherwise, feedback is
a gift; apologies will discount the importance and lessen the impact.
Nevertheless, corrective feedback must be given in a way that does not
jeopardize the recipient's dignity and sense of self-worth.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.4. To offer
an interpretation of the behavior or a hunch about what the behavior might
indicate is sometimes more helpful. Crucially important is to offer the
interpretation as a suggestion and never as a judgment or clinical evaluation
of the person. Only the recipient is capable of putting it into a meaningful
context. For example, the manager might say, "When Pete showed you the
error you made; you told him it was none of his concern. I wonder if you were
mad at Pete for some other reason." This statement shows the recipient the
behavior and allows him or her to consider a possible cause for that behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.5. The
appropriate response, as a rule of thumb, is to say  thank you  when either
type of feedback is received. Also appropriate of course is to ask for clarity
or more detail on an issue.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.6. The
purpose of feedback is to help the recipient. Feedback can be thought of as
food which is very nourishing. When people are hungry, food is what they need.
But when they are full, food is the last thing they want or need. The same
applies to ingesting feedback. When people have had enough, they should call a
halt. Attempting to absorb all the feedback that might be available, or that
various people would like to give, is like forcing food into a full stomach
just because someone says,  Please have some more. </span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.7. The
recipient is responsible for demanding specificity in feedback. No feedback
should be accepted as legitimate if it cannot be clearly demonstrated by an
observable behavior. For example, if someone says, "You're very
arrogant," an appropriate response would be "What specifically have I
said or done to cause you to think that?" If that response is countered
with "I don't know; I just experience you that way," then the
accusation should be immediately forgotten. People cannot afford to change just
to meet everyone's personal likes or expectations.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.8. In fact,
what is impossible is to change to meet everyone's expectations, and the
situation becomes compounded as more and more people give their feedback. A
single act can generate disparate feedback from different people who observe
the behavior. For example, a loud exclamation could be viewed as appropriately
angry by one person, overly harsh by another, and merely uncouth by a third.
Each person will see it from his or her unique perspective. Therefore, feedback
requires action from both the giver and the receiver. Only the giver can tell
what he or she observed or experienced, and only the recipient can use the
information in deciding whether or not to change the behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.1.2.9. For
feedback to be effective, the receiver must hear what the giver is saying,
weigh it, and then determine whether or not the information is relevant. The
following example illustrates how this can be done.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Department
manager:&nbsp;</span></b><span>"Waste in your unit
is up by four percent. Are you having any problems with your employees?"</span></p>

<p><b><span>Supervisor:&nbsp;</span></b><span>"I was not aware of the waste increase. No,
I am not having trouble with my employees. I suppose I have been focusing on
the quality so much that I lost sight of the waste figures. Thanks for bringing
this to my attention."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.7.2.&nbsp;<b>Feedback
Supports Growth.&nbsp;</b>The second major principle, "feedback supports
growth," is important because we cannot always see ourselves as others see
us. Although an individual may be the world's foremost authority on himself or
herself, there are still parts of the individual that are more obvious to other
people. Although people may be more aware of their own needs and capabilities
and more concerned about their own welfare than other people are, they are able
to stretch themselves and grow if they pay attention to feedback from others.
Although feedback may be extremely uncomfortable at the time, the individual
can look back later and realize the feedback was the spark that inspired the
change that turned his or her career or personal life in a different direction.
If the feedback is not rejected or avoided, recipients can discover and develop
ways to work that they did not think were available.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.&nbsp;<b>Feedback Strategies:</b></span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.1. The
strategies suggested here are not step-by-step procedures to be blindly
followed. Their purpose is to help in planning and organizing an approach to
deal with an issue. They offer a logical and effective sequence of events for
the feedback session. The person planning the session must decide on the
desired future objective. (The future<i>,&nbsp;</i>however, could be five
minutes after the session or two years later.) During the feedback session,
attention must be focused on what is happening in terms of the outcome. That
is, the focus must be on obtaining the goal, not on sticking to the strategy.
This focus allows the giver to change tactics or even modify the original strategy
if conditions change or unforeseen events occur. After the strategy is
selected, the following three rules should be kept in mind:</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.1.1. Be clear
about what you want in terms of specific, identifiable outcomes for yourself,
your subordinate, and the organization.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.1 2. Plan what
you intend to say and how you intend to conduct the meeting, according to the
particular strategy you will use.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.1.3. Have the
strategy in mind as you engage the individual, but keep it in the background.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.2.&nbsp;<b>Supportive
Feedback Strategy.</b>&nbsp;The following steps are suggested as a strategy for
supportive feedback:</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Acknowledge
the specific action to be reinforced.&nbsp;</b>Immediately let the subordinate
know that you are pleased about something he or she did. Be specific and
describe the event in behavioral terms. "You finished the project</span></p>

<p><span>(action) on time
(result)."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Explain
the effects of the accomplishment and state your appreciation.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>For
the behavior to be reinforced, the person must be able to see the effects of
that behavior in specific, observable ways. Your appreciation is important, but
as an additional reinforcing element. The main reinforcement is the effect.
"It was a major factor in securing the contract (effect), and I am pleased
with your outstanding work (appreciation)."</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Help
the subordinate to take full responsibility for the success.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>If
the employee acknowledges the feedback, this step is accomplished. If the
employee seems overly modest, more work is needed. Unless he or she can, to
some degree, internalize the success and receive satisfaction from it, very
little growth will occur. One approach would be to ask how the success was
accomplished or if any problems were encountered and how they were overcome. In
talking about what happened, the employee is likely to realize how much he or
she was really responsible for. What is important is for both you and the
employee to hear how the success was accomplished.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Ask
if the subordinate wants to talk about anything else.</b>&nbsp;While the
employee is feeling positive and knows that you are appreciative and receptive,
he or she may be willing to open up about other issues. The positive energy
created by this meeting can be directed toward other work related issues, so
take advantage of the opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.8.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Thank
the subordinate for the good performance</b>. The final step, again thanking
the subordinate for the accomplishment, assures that your appreciation will be
uppermost in his or her mind as he or she leaves and returns to the work
setting.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.9.&nbsp;<b>Corrective
Feedback Strategy.&nbsp;</b>The following steps are suggested as a strategy for
corrective feedback.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.9.1.&nbsp;<b>Immediately
describe the event in behavioral terms and explain the effect</b>. Clearly
relate in specific, observable, and behavioral terms the nature of the failure
or behavior and the effect of the failure or behavior on the work group or
organization. If you can appropriately say something to reduce the employee's
embarrassment, the employee is more likely to accept the feedback
non-defensively.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.9.2.&nbsp;<b>Ask
what happened.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>Before assuming that the subordinate is at
fault, ask what happened. In many instances, the subordinate is not at fault or
is only partially responsible. At worst, the employee is given an opportunity
to explain before you proceed; at best, you may receive information that would
prevent you from censuring the employee.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.9.3.&nbsp;<b>Help
the subordinate to take full responsibility for the actions.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>The
more time spent in step 2 (finding out what happened), the easier step 3 will
be. The subordinate needs to learn from the experience in order to reduce the
probability of a reoccurrence. Unless this step is handled effectively, the
subordinate will see himself or herself as a victim, rather than as someone who
made a mistake and is willing to correct it.</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.9.4.&nbsp;<b>Develop
a plan to deal with the issues.</b><i>&nbsp;</i>Once the subordinate has
accepted responsibility, the next step is to help rectify the situation. Now
that the employee is willing to be accountable for errors, you can
collaboratively devise a plan that will help eliminate them. That is, both of
you must agree to take action. If you each want the same thing, such as better
performance from the subordinate, then both of you are obligated to do
something about it. This is also an excellent opportunity to build on the
subordinate's strengths (e.g., "I d like for you to show the same fine
attention to safety regulations that you show to job specifications.")</span></p>

<p><span>22.16.9.5.<b><i>&nbsp;</i>State
your confidence in the subordinate's ability</b>.<i>&nbsp;</i>Once the issue is
resolved, end the session by stating your confidence in the ability of the
employee to handle the situation. The object is to allow the subordinate to
reenter the work setting feeling as optimistic about his or her self as the
situation permits. The subordinate must also understand that you will follow up
and give additional feedback when the situation warrants.</span></p>

<p><b><span>22.17. Conclusion.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Remember, the concept of power in the workforce usually has a
negative connotation. It brings to mind such associations as coercion,
manipulation, and even corruption. This does not have to be the case. Power has
many positive aspects, and everyone can learn to explore and harness different
sources of the individual power they have in the workplace. Develop your own
sources of power, and employees will be less dependent on others for the
leadership they need. Thus, if you want to do more good for yourself and more
good for the people around you, it is important to learn how to tap into your
own points of power.</span></p>

DECISION-MAKING</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section
23A Overview&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>23.1. Introduction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.1.1. Effective
Airmanship requires good decision-making. From Airman Basic to General the
decisions each of us make every day impact the delivery of airpower. The
following chapter is designed to spur development of critical thinking habits
in our Airmen and deepen their awareness of the decision-making processes. The
habits of mind necessary to become a critical thinker are developed over time;
there is no magical process or checklist to follow. Each of us must work every
day to make good decisions by consciously applying the intellectual analysis
necessary to account for complexities not normally considered and often
overlooked.</span></p>

<p><i><span>The process of decision-making is as important as the information
analyzed. The trap many of us fall into is focusing on the decision, not how
the decision should be made.</span></i></p>

<p><span>23.1.2. Decisions are
made by individuals acting alone, in groups, or on behalf of organizations,
each of these levels of decision-making present a variety of challenges. The
following discussion is intended to highlight these challenges and make you
aware of the conscious and unconscious challenges to applying good habits of
mind (critical thought) as Airmen every day.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 23B Critical
Thinking and Human Nature</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>23.2. Cognitive Bias:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.2.1. In thinking
about problems we are seldom the perfectly rational actor we hope to be.
Instead we are influenced by a number of factors that shape how we interpret
information, weigh its relevance, and ultimately decide upon a course of action
or inaction as the situation dictates. Psychologists use the term&nbsp;<i>bounded
rationality</i>&nbsp;to describe the actual operating state of the human mind.
What this means is that we are unable to be comprehensive in our gathering and
analysis of information as decision-making models assume. Instead of being
truly rational, and making the best possible decision, we end up  <i>satisficing.</i> </span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2. Cognitive bias
in our decision processes result in several  traps' decision-makers need to
guard against. Some of the more common are:</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Overconfidence
bias.</b>&nbsp;Humans are overconfident in their own judgments, often
unreasonably so.</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Sunk-cost
effect.&nbsp;</b>The tendency to escalate commitment to a course of action you
have already made a substantial investment or resources in (time, money,
personnel, etc.) despite poor performance.</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.3.<b>&nbsp;Availability
bias.&nbsp;</b>Tendency to place too much emphasis on information we have
available instead of the information we need during decision-making.</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Confirmation
bias.&nbsp;</b>The most prevalent bias, this propensity refers to our tendency
to gather and use information that confirms our existing views while
downplaying or avoiding information that challenges our working hypothesis.</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.5.<b>&nbsp;Anchoring
bias.</b>&nbsp;The unconscious tendency to allow an initial reference point to
distort our estimates, even when that initial reference point is completely
arbitrary. Starting at an extreme position may act as an anchor for all parties
in a decision process or negotiation. In a negotiation, this bias can work in
favor of the side that stakes out the initial reference point both sides tend
to use the initial position as a reference point for the solution (i.e. car
salesman techniques).</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.6.<b>&nbsp;Illusory
bias.</b>&nbsp;Tendency to jump to conclusions about the relationship between
two variables when in fact no relationship (correlation) exists.</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.7.<b>&nbsp;Hindsight
bias.</b>&nbsp;The tendency to judge past events as easily predictable when in
fact they were not easily foreseen. This bias limits our ability to learn from
past mistakes and may affect how leaders evaluate subordinate decision-making.</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.2.8.<b>&nbsp;Egocentrism.</b>&nbsp;When
we attribute more credit to ourselves for group or collaborative outcome than
an outside party making an unbiased assessment would.</span></p>



<p><span>23.2.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>As
decision makers Airmen need to be aware of cognitive biases and consciously
take steps to guard against their affects. The habitual application of critical
thinking methods to the gathering and analysis of information helps reduce our
unconscious and natural tendency to satisfice in decision-making. Some
techniques to counter cognitive biases include:</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.3.1.<b>&nbsp;After-action
reviews</b>&nbsp;provide powerful learning moments for participants and serve
as a forum for feedback to the decision maker about his/her decision style  
helping to prevent repetition of mistakes.</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Seeking
unbiased outside expert input</b>&nbsp;can help provide a check and balance on
reasoning and the interpretation of available information.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>23.2.3.3.<b>&nbsp;Creating
a decision environment encouraging candid dialogue</b>&nbsp;and vigorous debate
is perhaps the most effective way to minimize the influence of cognitive bias.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.3. Mental Frames:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.3.1. Each of us uses
mental frameworks and shortcuts to simplify our understanding of a complex
world. The use of these frameworks helps us process information quickly and
efficiently. Understanding that these frameworks contribute to the bias
presented earlier, the following discussion is intended to make you aware of
how the frameworks you have built, based on your own unique personal
experiences; these experiences shape your own decision-making process and the
solutions you derive.</span></p>

<p><span>23.3.2. Frames consist
of our assumptions about how things are related and how they work. How we frame
a problem influences the decisions we make. This effect is particularly
noticeable when framing a challenge as either a risk or an opportunity.
Research shows that the human mind estimates the expected return when
confronted with a risky situation and that we tend to be risk adverse. Our risk
aversion and the importance of framing are explained in Prospect Theory.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.4. Prospect Theory.</span></b></p>

<p><span>According to the&nbsp;<i>Prospect
Theory,</i>&nbsp;framing a situation as a potential gain causes decision makers
to act differently than framing same situation as a potential loss. Faced with
potential losses most people are willing to take greater risks than when facing
with potential gains. The Prospect Theory helps explain our tendency to
escalate commitment based on sunk costs instead of making rational evaluations
based on how things exist today. Based on sunk cost arguments, leaders often
take-on more and more risk, committing additional resources in order to avoid
losses even when the chances of success are low.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.5. Risk or Opportunity.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Another implication of
framing is how organizations react when faced with changes in the operating
environment or mission tasking. At the organizational level, threats to our
comfortable framework of assumptions are often met with rigid resistance while
changes we see as opportunities are met with flexible and adaptable approaches.
Often inaccurate expectations are established as a result of mental frames
applied by decision makers. As human beings Airmen are subject to the initial
frameworks we establish when confronting change. For good or bad these
frameworks act to limit the information we take in, our willingness to fairly
and unbiasedly assess information, and ultimately restrict the solution sets we
create.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.6. Intuition:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.6.1. When decision
makers use intuition to choose courses of action they are not evaluating a
whole series of alternatives and are not selecting solutions based on objective
analysis. Intuition is based on previous experience, and matching patterns from
these experiences, to cues picked up in the current environment. As patterns
are recognized, humans automatically reason by analogy, projecting past
situations into our current environment. Based on recognition of patterns,
decision makers often select a course of action as if reading a script, instead
of exploring a wide range of options. Having decided on an initial preferred
course of action, senior leaders often mentally play out the solution; and if
it seems feasible, they go with it. For decision makers, intuition is both a
powerful guide and a potential decision trap.</span></p>

<p><span>23.6.2. When operating
in challenging or ambiguous situations, highly experienced professionals often
have intuitive reactions to events. Although unable to articulate their
unconscious pattern recognition, experts are often correct in their analysis
and selection of a course of action despite what a novice may perceive as a
lack of information or signals pointing to a contrary course of action. In highly
complex and ambiguous situations, however, the complexity obscures pattern
recognition and experienced Airmen can mistakenly apply incorrect or outdated
models, resulting in poor decision-making. This is especially true when
decision makers are operating outside of their experience base, for instance,
when leading higher-level organizations or moving from one career field to
another.</span></p>



<p><b><span>23.7. Key Points to Remember:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.7.1. Airmen,
especially leaders within any organization, must be careful about imposing
mental frames on themselves and their team in order to create an environment
where critical thinking is exercised. When leaders hold back personal opinions
they avoid framing the situation in preconceived ways (that constricts the
range of advice and alternatives offered). By consciously avoiding the natural
tendency to view change as threatening, intentionally framing change as an
opportunity, Airmen are free to exercise the habits of mind necessary to make
well informed decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>23.7.2. A challenge for
Airmen in a position of responsibility is to avoid the human tendency to
continue a course of action due to sunk costs; proper use of combined intuitive
judgment and formal analysis is one means for avoiding this decision trap. The
use of analysis to check intuition is an effective decision-making technique.
Formal analysis can check intuition and assures you challenge your intuitive
judgment, not confirm it. Conversely, intuition is useful in validating and
testing the assumptions that underlie analysis. As Airmen, recognizing the
value of intuition is just as critical as guarding against a lack of analysis
in the decision-making process. Do not try to replace intuition with rules and
procedures; intuition is often compressed experience indicating as of yet
unrecognized patterns in the environment. Airmen must routinely and consciously
create decision processes with information flowing freely in both directions.</span></p>

<p><span>23.7.3. A simple
five-step process for communicating intuitive decisions, seeking feedback, and conveying
intent is to use the following statements when addressing decision teams:</span></p>

<p><span>23.7.3.1. Here's what I
think we face.</span></p>

<p><span>23.7.3.2. Here's what I
think we should do.</span></p>

<p><span>23.7.3.3. Here's why.</span></p>

<p><span>23.7.3.4. Here's what we
should keep our eye on.</span></p>

<p><span>23.7.3.5. Now, talk to
me.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.8. Analogies:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.8.1. Analogies are very powerful
decision-making tools and often the greatest innovative breakthroughs occur
when analogies from one field or domain are applied to others. Reasoning by
analogy occurs when we assess a situation and match it to similar experiences
we have encountered, assuming that they are alike. At the conscious level,
Airmen can deliberately use analogies to frame a decision-making process; they
save time and provide clues about possible courses of action and implications,
at the unconscious level analogies play a large role in intuition as discussed
in the previous section.</span></p>

<p><span>23.8.2. The critical
thinking trap inherent in the use of analogies is that they can lead us to
focus on similarities between events and downplay important differences. Very
powerful experiences from our past leave us overly reliant on very salient
analogies, even when they no longer fit current situation; thus, blinding
Airmen to the requirement to explore and question underlying assumptions.</span></p>

<p><span>23.8.3. In order to
avoid the temptation to focus on similarities and downplay differences decision
makers and their teams should consciously make two lists: one describing
similarities and the other describing differences. A second technique is to
write down and clearly define what you know, what is unknown, and what you
presume about the situation you are analyzing. The objective of both these
techniques is to clearly separate fact from assumption and then probe your
presumptions carefully. The act of questioning our assumptions in any decision
process is, at its heart, how we apply the habits of mind necessary for good
critical thought.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 23C Critical
Thinking in Groups</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>23.9. Wisdom of Groups:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.9.1. Conventional
wisdom holds that groups make better decisions than individuals because they
draw from a diverse base of talent and experience. Unfortunately, many groups
fail to make good decisions because they fail to merge the diverse ideas and
recognize potential synergies; the result is a failure to capitalize on the
team's diverse talents. When this happens teams can actually make worse
decisions than a talented individual. Airmen must be conscious of how group
decisions are made and create teams capable of applying critical thought to
problems in a group setting.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.2. Airmen engaged
in the group decision-making must consciously structure the process to
encourage critical thinking. Leaders must begin by deciding:</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.2.1. Who should be
involved in the decision process?</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.2.2. In what sort
of environment does the decision take place?</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.2.3. How will the
participants communicate?</span></p>

<p><span>29.9.2.4. How will the
leader control the decision process?</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.3. Unfortunately,
due to bias, a lack of time, framing, personnel shortages, outside pressure, or
any number of other reasons leaders often fail to decide  how to decide? 
Instead, they rely on existing decision processes and groups, even though they
may be unreliable given the context of the issue.</span></p>

<p align="center"><span>23.9.4. Some argue that
groups are more intelligent than individual experts because the aggregation of
their judgment leads to a better answer, even though they are not a group of
experts. In some cases this is true, but it is not a given.</span></p>

<p><span>Several critical
preconditions are necessary. To be effective groups of non-experts must:</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.4.1. Be diverse.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.4.2. Represent many
different disciplines, perspectives, and areas of expertise.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.4.3. Be
decentralized.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.4.4. Be able to
effectively aggregate all the individual judgments.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.4.5. Contain
members who are independent (most important).</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.5. Within groups,
information-processing problems can prevent the pooling of collective
knowledge. Group members tend to discuss areas of common information while
failing to surface privately held information for personal reasons or a failure
to recognize its importance. Airmen, because of our shared heritage and
commitment to teamwork must constantly guard against the trap of ignoring
information in an effort to find common ground. Even when data is widely
discussed and analyzed, the filtering of data as it moves up the decision chain
can prevent decision makers from having access to the nuances of these
discussions during the decision process. If as an Airmen you are in positions
to make decisions based on the recommendations of groups you should be aware of
how the group was set-up and operated and make an effort to understand the
decision-making process they used.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.6.<b>&nbsp;Wisdom of Groups Conclusion.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Things to be aware of
when forming a decision-making team:</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.6.1. Individuals
must be able to sway others in the crowd, a condition that is often lacking in
the organizational decision-making environment.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.6.2.
Interdependence and hierarchy of group members can neutralize the benefits
group decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.6.3. Pressure to
conform and fractionalization of groups into sub groups can prevent honest
analysis.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.6.4. The tendency
of some individuals to dominate the discussions can inhibit less aggressive
members from presenting their ideas, especially if these ideas are call into
question the prevailing wisdom of the dominant personalities.</span></p>

<p><span>23.9.6.5. Conversely,
members that do not feel personally accountable for the group's outcomes may
 free ride  by not presenting their ideas, content to allow others to  carry
the load .</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.10.<i>&nbsp;Groupthink
(Thinking or Conforming):</i></span></b></p>

<p><span>23.10.1.<i>&nbsp;Groupthink</i>&nbsp;is
a well-known decision trap most of us are familiar with and a major reason
groups make flawed decisions.&nbsp;<i>Groupthink</i>&nbsp;occurs when
tremendous pressures within the team for conformity and a desire for unanimity
drive decision-making at the expense of true critical thinking. Without candid
dialogue between team members, and real assessment of options, groups tend to
spend most of their time tweaking proposed solutions rather than examining
evidence and assumptions to create new options. Many factors contribute to
groupthink, including the homogeneity of the group, reporting and supervisory
chains, and permanent versus long-term nature of the groups involved.</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.2. Within groups,
especially long standing groups, individuals often self-sensor based on a
desire to avoid becoming ostracized and marginalized. As a result, a fallacy
develops within the team; each member erroneously believes the other team
members unanimously support a decision or course of action, making it harder to
present dissenting opinions. If alternative options were previously examined
and dismissed, they are rarely reconsidered based on new information or changes
in the decision environment.</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.3. To avoid group think
Airmen must be aware of the below symptoms of&nbsp;<i>Groupthink</i>:</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.3.1. The group has
a feeling of being invulnerable (it cannot fail).</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.3.2. Inherent
belief that the group is better than rivals (cultural egocentric thought,
stereotyping).</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.3.3.
Rationalization away of disconfirming data and warning signs.</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.3.4. The group has
a feeling of being unanimous in support for particular views.</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.3.5. Majority
pressuring those with dissenting views.</span></p>

<p><span>23.10.3.6. Group
member's self-sensor rather than challenge majority perspective to avoid
becoming ostracized or marginalized.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.11. Groupthink Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.11.1. For some
decision events, outside consultation may be the only way to avoid groupthink.
In other cases, Airmen can work to minimize structural barriers to candid
dialogue and reduce groupthink tendencies within their organization.</span></p>

<p><span>23.11.1.1. Reduce
structural complexity and the information filtering that occurs because of
internal organizational barrier and interest groups.</span></p>

<p><span>23.11.1.2. Defining
roles within decision-making teams, giving responsibility to members for
aspects of the analysis process and holding them accountable for representing
these perspectives within the group.</span></p>

<p><span>23.11.1.3. Reducing
homogeneity of team composition to bring in alternative perspectives.</span></p>

<p><span>23.11.1.4. Reduce status
difference and rating chain conflicts between team members that might squelch
candid dialogue.</span></p>

<p><span>23.11.1.5. Invite
disagreement during the analysis process; a failure to do so will squelch
candid dialogue.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.12. Debate and Conflict:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.12.1. Disagreement
between participants in any decision process is necessary to stimulate inquiry
and analysis. The challenge for leaders in any decision process is to create
constructive conflict while retaining the teamwork and relationships necessary
for future decision events. In the decision-making process, debate focused on
the issues and ideas at hand (<i>cognitive conflict</i>) is constructive; on
the other hand, emotional and personal outbursts (<i>affective conflict</i>)
are not.</span></p>

<p><span>23.12.2. A key aspect of
managing the decision process is to stimulate&nbsp;<i>cognitive conflict</i>&nbsp;to
advocate positions and analysis debating concepts, but not attacking the person
representing them. Airmen in leadership positions should clearly establish
ground rules for interaction during deliberations and require participants to
respect each other's cognitive and analytical styles.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.13. Critical Thinking in Groups Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.13.1. Decision makers
must ensure they are not structuring their decision process to minimize
conflict at the expense of critical thinking. Leaders set the example by:
identifying and articulating the mental models they apply, encouraging others
to challenge these models, avoiding prematurely selecting courses of action
before debate is finished, and encouraging others to make mistakes. In other
words, professional debate is constructive, unprofessional personalization of
debate is not. Without adhering to the levels of professionalism expected of
Airmen we squelch the critical thinking necessary to innovate and ensure good
decision-making.</span></p>

<p><span>23.13.2. Some techniques
include assigning members to act as adversaries; and/or to advocate multiple
scenarios address the problem. These techniques give participants the
responsibility to provide contrary perspectives and use varying lenses for
information analysis. Dissenters must be encouraged to try to persuade other
team members, not senior leadership; this practice stimulates debate and forces
critical thinking. However, if employed, senior leaders must guard against the
temptation to domesticate dissenters, using them as token  devils advocates. </span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 23D Critical
Thinking and Organizational Culture</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>23.14. The Inability to Decide.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Many leaders and
organizations are plagued by chronic and persistent indecision. Indecision
resulting from dysfunctional patterns of behavior manifests itself as one of
three harmful organizational cultures: (1) culture of  no ; (2) culture of
 yes ; and 3) culture of  maybe. </span></p>

<p><span>23.14.1.<b>&nbsp;Culture
of no</b>. Organizations with a culture of no have established a decision
process where lone dissenters are able to issue non-concurs within the planning
process, effectively blocking overall organizational goals because they
conflict with internal sub-organizational interests. This culture can arise in
organizations where decision meetings focus on dissections of proposals instead
of true debate and analysis. Leaders who reward subordinates based on their
ability to dissect others ideas without providing alternative courses of action
enable and promote a culture of no. Do not forget the importance of being able
to differentiate between the use of a  devil's advocate  and the culture of no.
In a culture of no, dissenters are trying to tear down or block proposals and
ideas, not critique a proposal with the intent of strengthening it.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.2.<b>&nbsp;Culture
of yes.</b>&nbsp;Within a culture of yes, dissenters tend to stay silent. This
silence becomes a tacit endorsement of the proposal without the benefit of
analysis and debate. In this form of organizational culture, once a decision is
made subordinates later express disagreement to distance themselves from a
decision or work to overturn or undermine the implementation of the plan.
Airmen operating in this type of culture must understand that silence does not
mean assent and watch for those not contributing to the discussion. This type
of culture can develop when leadership devalues critical analysis. Overcoming
this cultural tendency requires leadership to create constructive conflict
within the decision process to surface and analyze concerns and alternative
interpretations of evidence.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.3.<b>&nbsp;Culture
of maybe.</b>&nbsp;Under the culture of maybe, decision makers work to gather
as much information as possible, so much so they become trapped in  <i>analysis
paralysis</i>.  Under&nbsp;<i>analysis paralysis</i>, decision makers constantly
delay action because they think more information and analysis will clarify
their choice. This culture tends to develop in organizations facing highly
ambiguous situations; or in organizations where competing sections/leaders
practice conflict avoidances as opposed to open analysis and debate. In these
organizations, decision makers must balance the benefit of gaining more
information against the diminishing returns they provide (as opposed to
initiating action). While leaders are seldom able to accurately calculate the
cost versus benefit of waiting for additional clarity, intuitive judgment
serves as a cut-off for unnecessary delay.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.<b>&nbsp;Procedural Justice:</b></span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.1. The process
by which a decision is made significantly influences implementation and
follow-through of the solution. The key aspect to outcome of a critical
decision is consensus among the team responsible for enactment. Consensus does
not mean unanimity rather, consensus is a commitment to, and shared
understanding of, the desired outcome.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.2. Sections
above discussed the need for debate and conflict in applying true critical
thinking to decisions and the challenge of keeping the debate constructive.
Airmen must also work to make sure the process is fair and legitimate. Even
when participants agree with the chosen course of action, if they do not see
the process as legitimate they are often disenchanted with the outcome.
Procedural fairness provides support to decision makers, especially when they
are making unpopular decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.3. Fair
processes helps build consensus. More importantly, they aid implementation
because participants feel that all perspectives have been considered and
analyzed. If decision-makers are subjective in their analysis, participants
lose faith in the decision process, making it difficult to support the outcome.
Providing participants with time and venues to air positions, and a transparent
system of weighing different perspectives, is important. In essence, fair
process means that the decision maker demonstrates genuine consideration of
alternatives. This does not mean debate continues endlessly. When final
decisions are made the fairness of the process is what allows Airmen arguing
for various positions to rally around the designated way ahead with confidence
that the decision maker considered all aspects before making the decision on
which course of action to pursue.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.4. Procedural
legitimacy in decision-making occurs when the decision process is perceived to
be in line with an organization's socially accepted norms and desired behavior.
Airmen in leadership positions must avoid artificially limiting debate and
analysis of information. In order to create an organizational culture of
decision legitimacy leaders can do the following:</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.1. Provide a
process road map at the beginning of the decision process.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.2. Reinforce and
demonstrate an open mind-set.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.3. Engage in
active listening and make sure others do too.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.4. Separate
advocacy from analysis.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.5. Explain the
decision rationale once made.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.4.6. Express
appreciation for everyone's participation and how alternative inputs
contributed to the process.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.5.<b>&nbsp;Normal Accidents and
Normalizing Deviance.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Within the United States
Air Force, like any other organization decisions made in highly complex tightly
integrated environments often have unanticipated consequence. If Airmen are
unaware of, or have failed to think through decisions catastrophic failure can
be the result. With the understanding of the role all Airmen play in using the
habits of mind for critical thinking provided above, the following sections
examine two perspectives on decision-making failure one structural; the other
behavioral (Normal Accident Theory, Normalized Deviance).</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.6.<b>&nbsp;Normal Accident Theory:</b></span></p>

<p><span>23.14.6.1. This theory
rests upon the assumption that in any highly complex high-risk organizational
structure decision failures are unavoidable. High-risk systems are systems
classified by their complexity and the coupling of multiple processes occurring
in conjunction with one another. Systems that are interactively complex and
tightly coupled are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic failure stemming
from mistakes made by decision makers, often small mistakes, which go unrecognized
or uncorrected and increasingly skew outcomes as they work their way through
the system.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.6.2. In coupled
systems tight interactions based on poor decisions can magnify normal accidents
into system-wide failure. In simple linear processes, such as an assembly line,
failure has a visible impact on the next process but is identifiable and
limited. When interactions are nonlinear and affect a variety of other systems,
the failure of one component has unanticipated effects on many subsystems. If
the subsystems are tightly coupled (highly interdependent) a failure quickly
causes changes in multiple systems nearly simultaneously making it hard for
leaders to diagnose the symptoms and see the extent of the developing failure.
Because Airmen project power globally, anticipation of the impact even minor
deviations from procedure or instruction can have is extremely challenging.
This is the reason we stress adherence to standard operating procedures and
Airmen must apply the habits of critical thinking before deviation from our
normal operations   others are counting on our predictability to do their job
safely as we work together to advance United States security interests.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.7.<b>&nbsp;Normalizing Deviance:</b></span></p>

<p><span>23.14.7.1. This is the
gradual acceptance of unexpected events and risk as a normal part of the
operating environment. Eventually the deviations are accepted as a normal
occurrence and no longer assessed using the habits of mind necessary to
identify causes and find solutions. As organizational members become accustomed
to the reoccurrence of seemingly minor but unpredicted anomalies in a system
they become less concerned with the potential catastrophic effect of more
severe failures of the same systems. The classic case is the&nbsp;<i>Challenger</i>&nbsp;space
shuttle disaster. In this case, the erosion of O-rings was not within
acceptable tolerances. However, after its occurrence several times with no
catastrophic result, the members of the organization accepted their erosion as
a normal and acceptable event, despite deviation from their engineering
standards. In this case National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as an
organization, was working hard to make space flight feel routine. The
organization's culture, combined with cognitive bias and external pressures to
make space flight routine led do the normalization of a potentially
catastrophic failure.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.7.2. Normalization
of deviance is the gradual acceptance of lower standards of performance. This
practice produces shortcuts in the way organizations act. These variations then
become normal procedures normalized to the point where the deviance is no
longer even noticed. As Airmen we should not accept this practice, we guard
against this by continuously questioning the way we do business and digging
into any failure to meet the standards we set for performance.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.7.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>Airmen
must be aware of the type of organization they operate within and understand
its complex interactions. They must consciously identify the  close-calls' and
deviances from normal operations. All Airmen must ensure deviations from
standards are analyzed as part of the decision-making process to gain an
understanding of how to improve programs and implement new decisions.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.<b>&nbsp;Practical Drift and Ambiguity:</b></span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.1.<b>&nbsp;Practical
Drift.</b></span><sup><span>&nbsp;</span></sup><span>Within large organizations, sub-unit leaders at
all levels make decisions to maximize efficiency. They establish localized
rules and procedures that comply with the overall intent of the organization.
Over time these procedures become accepted practice. Similar to&nbsp;<i>Normalizing
Deviance</i>&nbsp;(discussed above), this practice causes organizational norms
to drift. Often, this drift is unproblematic however, under ambiguous
conditions in complex interactive environments, divergence may lead to altered
expectations and poor information flow (resulting in catastrophic cross-system
failure; e.g. Blackhawk shoot down).</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.2. Airmen must
be aware of how their decisions at the local level tie in with overall
organizational goals, standards, and expectations. Leaders must use their
awareness of organizational goals and standards to monitor&nbsp;<i>practical
drift</i>&nbsp;in their areas of responsibility, recognizing disciplined
initiative, while maintaining standards consistent with outside expectations.
This task becomes difficult when many sub-units work together. Communications
breakdowns across large organizations often cause a loss of perspective on
how&nbsp;<i>practical drift</i>&nbsp;may be creating problems with follow-on
unforeseen consequences.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.3. The challenge
for Airmen of all ranks is that ambiguous threats do not trigger organizational
responses. The failure to apply critical thinking to ambiguous threats means
that the recovery window between the emergence of the threat and its occurrence
as a catastrophic failure may narrow. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's organizational culture caused leaders to downplay O-ring
failure, moving it from a critical to an ambiguous threat. Airmen at all levels
must be aware that ambiguous threats may go unaddressed due to information
filters caused by structural complexity and inter-organization power dynamics.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.4. Airmen in
positions of responsibility must work to temper&nbsp;<i>practical drift</i>&nbsp;and
create a culture where critical thinking is applied to ambiguous threats. This
goal can be accomplished by developing processes for identifying and analyzing
small problems and failures, treating them as potential indicators of larger
problems.&nbsp; Effective techniques include: empowerment of front line
troops/workers; and flattening hierarchies to reduce information filtering.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.4.1. To further
minimize the problems associated with&nbsp;<i>practical drift</i>, leaders can
also:</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.4.2. Create and
encourage transparency in organizational structures and systems to identify
local&nbsp;<i>practical drift</i>&nbsp;and understand the  why  behind local
standards.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.4.3. Avoid  <i>band-aid </i>&nbsp;approaches
to small problems   fix the root cause across the system.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.4.4. Create a
climate of candid dialogue where you review and revisit standards and seek
problems.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.4.5. Monitor
seams where information is handed off between units and organizations.</span></p>

<p><span>23.14.8.4.6. Conduct
careful after-action reviews focused on process improvement.</span></p>

<p><b><span>23.15. Conclusion:</span></b></p>

<p><span>23.15.1. Airmen at all
levels participate in decision-making daily. The habits of mind necessary to
assure we apply critical thought are something we must consciously foster. Our
diverse and highly educated force brings to the table a wide variety of views,
experiences, and abilities; providing the United States Air Force a deep pool
of talent to draw ideas from. By using the techniques of good decision-making
and fostering the development of habits of mind in our Airmen we tap into that
rich pool of talent. When time allows we must consciously create processes to
think though decisions using critical analysis of all factors, ensuring we
focus on doing what is best for the nation and the Air Force. This effort to
create habits of mind pays off when we must make decisions quickly and under
great pressure. During these times we naturally fall back on the
decision-making processes we use every day.</span></p>

<p><span>23.15.2. In order to
create these good habits of mind Airmen in leadership positions at all levels,
from the back shop to the Air Staff, must create an environment where Airmen
are free to exercise critical thought. We must guard against organizational
cultures and leadership styles designed to simply arrive at a decision and
quickly move on. Organizations and leaders focused on the decision, not the
decision-making process tend to stifle critical analysis of issues and prevent
development of good habits of mind; ultimately causing poor decision-making and
negatively affecting the United States Air Force, the Department of Defense,
and our nation.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>STUDYING EFFECTIVELY</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 24A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>24.1. Introduction.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Getting the most out of
promotion studies is an individual affair. No method will produce the best
results for every Airman. Lack of success may have more to do with poorly
developed study skills than intellectual ability. This chapter suggests methods
for effective studying, but each Airman must determine which methods and
strategies work best for him or her. This chapter covers effective study
habits, study strategies, the military knowledge and testing system, and a
learning style self-assessment instrument to help Airmen prepare for promotion
exams. This information is not testable for promotion.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 24B Effective Study Habits in Eight
Easy Steps</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>24.2. General Information.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Airmen grapple with many issues that may make it
difficult to concentrate on studying. To get promoted, you must study for your
Promotion Fitness Exam or United States Air Force Supervisory Exam. The key to
effective studying is to study smartly. You can begin with these effective
study habits.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.<b>&nbsp;Approach Studying with the
Right Mindset:</b></span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.1. Many people
consider studying a necessary task, rather than an enjoyable opportunity to
learn, but research indicates that how you approach a task is almost as
important as the task itself. Having the right mindset may help you study more
effectively.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.2. Sometimes you
can t force yourself to have the right mindset. During such times, you should
take a study break. If you are distracted by other issues, studying will be an
exercise in futility. Come back to it when you re not focused on something
else.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.3. How to improve
your study mindset:</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.3.1. Decide to
think positively while you study; remind yourself of your skills and abilities.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.3.2. Avoid
catastrophic thinking. Instead of thinking,  I ll never have enough time to
study for this exam,  think  It may be a little late to start studying, but if
I do it now, I can still get most of it done. </span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.3.3. Avoid
absolute thinking. Instead of thinking  I always mess up,  the more objective
view is,  I didn t do very well last time. What can I do to improve? </span></p>

<p><span>24.2.1.3.4. Avoid
comparing yourself negatively with others.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.2.<b>&nbsp;Bring Everything You Need;
Nothing You Don t:</b></span></p>

<p><span>24.2.2.1. When you find
an ideal place to study, you may bring things you don t need. For example, it
may seem ideal to type notes into a computer to refer to later, but computers
are a powerful distraction for many people. So ask yourself if you really need
a computer to take notes, or can you make do with the old-fashioned paper and
pencil.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.2.2. Don t forget
the things you need to study for promotion (see the Enlisted Promotion
Reference and Requirements catalog,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf"><span>https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf</span></a><a href="https://www.omsq.af.mil/TE/EPRRC.pdf"><span>)</span></a><span>&nbsp;to ensure you are studying the correct
information. Don t waste time running back and forth to get an important book,
paper, or other resource.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Outline and Rewrite Your
Notes.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Many people find a
standard outline format helps them boil information down to its most basic
components, and connecting similar concepts makes information easier to
remember during an exam. An outline is most effective as a learning tool when
you use your own words and structure because everyone connects similar
information differently. Failing to outline in your own style and words may
result in failure to remember important items.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Use Memory Games (Mnemonic
Devices):</b></span></p>

<p><span>20.2.4.1. Memory games,
such as mnemonic devices, use simple word association to help remember pieces
of information. Some people string together words to form an easy-to-remember
nonsense sentence. The first letter of each word stands for a piece of the
information you re trying to remember. A common military mnemonic device
example is  Be My Little General of the Air Force.  The first letters of the
words help you remember the general officer ranks: Brigadier, Major,
Lieutenant, and General.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.4.2. The key to
such memory devices is the new phrase or sentence you come up with has to be
more memorable and easier to remember than the terms or information you re
trying to learn. These don t work for everyone, so if mnemonics don t work for
you, don t use them.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Practice,
Practice, Practice.&nbsp;</b>The age-old adage  practice makes perfect  is
true. You can practice by yourself using practice exams or flash cards
(depending on what's available). If a practice exam isn t available, you can
make one yourself. However, interactive exercises available at</span><a href="http://pdg.af.mil/"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><a href="http://pdg.af.mil/"><span>http://pdg.af.mil/</span></a><a href="http://pdg.af.mil/"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>may help you retain information from Air Force
Handbook 1,&nbsp;<i>Airman</i>. Whatever tools you use, practice can enhance
your retention of general military knowledge in the Air Force Handbook 1,&nbsp;<i>Airman</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.6.&nbsp;<b>Make and Stick to a Schedule:</b></span></p>

<p><span>20.2.6.1. Many people
plan to study when they get around to it or have some spare time. If you
schedule study time the same way your duty hours are scheduled, you ll find
studying is less hassle in the long run. Instead of last-minute cramming
sessions, scheduling the same amount of study time every day for 3 to 6 months
before your promotion test will be easier and enable you to learn more of the
material.</span></p>

<p><span>20.2.6.2. Some people
study every day, others once or twice a week. Frequency isn t as important as
actually studying routinely. Even if you study one day a week for 6 to 8
months, that is better than a massive cram session a few days before the exam.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.7.&nbsp;<b>Build in Breaks and Rewards:</b></span></p>

<p><span>20.2.7.1. If you view
studying as a chore, it will be natural to avoid it. If, however, you use
rewards to help reinforce what you re doing, you may be pleasantly surprised by
an attitude change.</span></p>

<p><span>20.2.7.2. Start by
breaking study time into manageable components. Studying for 4 hours at a time
without a break is unrealistic for most people. Studying for an hour followed
by a 5-minute break and a snack may be more sustainable and enjoyable for you.
Divide study time into segments that make sense and work for you.</span></p>

<p><span>20.2.7.3. When
establishing your goals, establish rewards as well. Tell yourself specifically
what your reward will be if you reach your goal: Maybe  I will have a special
dessert tonight if...,  or  I will buy a new song online if...,  or  I will
spend an extra 30 minutes gaming if...  for reaching the established goal. The
point is, find a reward that is small but real, and to stick to it. Setting
limits on your behavior is a method to teach yourself discipline.</span></p>

<p><span>24.2.8.&nbsp;<b>Stay Healthy and Balanced:</b></span></p>

<p><span>20.2.8.1. It may seem
hard to live a balanced life, but the more balanced your life, the easier every
component becomes. If you spend all of your time focused on one thing, your
life may become unbalanced. When that happens, everything becomes more
difficult.</span></p>

<p><span>20.2.8.2. Maintaining a
balanced life comes more easily over time, but you can work to improve health
and balance by doing what you already know: exercise regularly, eat nutritious
food, and get enough sleep. There are no shortcuts to good health.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 24C Study
Strategies</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>24.3. General Information.</span></b></p>

<p><span>Whether you are studying
for a promotion test, specialty knowledge test, or any other test, the
following study strategies may help you attain your goals:</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Stay Motivated.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Studying and learning
can take you far in life, yet it can seem so hard to get around to it, and
life's constant distractions don t help.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.1.1.&nbsp;<b>Attention.</b>&nbsp;Distractions
can affect your motivation to study. If you were totally isolated on a desert
island, where there was absolutely nothing to do but study, you d study every
word of your subject until you were completely versed in it because there would
be nothing to distract you. Having so many choices means now more than ever we
need to exert willpower.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.1.2.&nbsp;<b>What
Do You Want Out of Life?</b>&nbsp;To stay motivated, you should think about why
you are studying. Presumably, studying is connected to what you want out of
life, so ask yourself what you will ultimately get out of those things you do
to avoid studying. Your life will be what you make of it.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.1.3.&nbsp;<b>Feed
and Develop Your Mind.&nbsp;</b>We live in a world surrounded by entertainment
options. However, your mind needs the nutrition of study as well as the
relaxation of entertainment. When you study well, you find it has its own
subtle pleasures and satisfactions apart from the positive results it can bring
into your life.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A6/CSS/Project%20Documents/AFPAM36-2241/References/MSU%20Learning%20Center.doc"><span>24.3.2.</span></a><a href="https://eis.aetc.af.mil/hq/A6/CSS/Project%20Documents/AFPAM36-2241/References/MSU%20Learning%20Center.doc"><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></a><b><span>Use Time Wisely.</span></b></p>

<p><span>You might have all the
time in the world, but if you don t use it wisely, it won t help you to meet
your goals. Procrastination is a problem for many students. The following tips
may help you deal with this issue:</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Clear
Your Schedule.&nbsp;</b>Recognize that your obligations are as important as
other people's needs. Set limits to prevent or minimize interruptions. Give
full concentration to your studies without feeling guilty for whatever you re
not doing.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Get
Motivated.</b>&nbsp;Create a distraction-free work area, and commit to staying
there for until you meet the day's study goal. If you get sidetracked, remind
yourself how studying will help you achieve your goals.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Prioritize.&nbsp;</b>Answers
to these questions may help you establish a priority list: What must be done
first? When is it due? What is worth more in terms of the score? What is worth
more in terms of personal, educational or career goals?</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Use a
Daily  To Do  List.</b>&nbsp;A  to do  list can help you reach your goals by
helping you prioritize your daily tasks. As you complete tasks, check them off
your list.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Break
Your Study into Chunks.</b>&nbsp;Estimate how much time you ll need to complete
a task, and don t try to do it all at one time. Break it down so that it s
achievable without being overwhelming.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.2.6.<b>&nbsp;It
Doesn t Have to Be Perfect.</b>&nbsp;Some people are so afraid they won t
perform perfectly that they don t do anything at all. Make sure you understand
your goals. Then evaluate how important your study is and what level of
performance is acceptable to you. Then, just do it.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.2.7.<b>&nbsp;When
You Really Hate It, Do It First.</b>&nbsp;Work on a task you really hate first,
while you have more energy. Reward yourself when you complete those items on
your daily list.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.3.<b>&nbsp;Study Environment.</b></span></p>

<p><span>Once you know when and
for how long you will study, commit to a time and place that meets your needs.
Make that decision based on whether the environment matches your learning
style. See Section 20E of this chapter for information to help you understand
your dominant learning style. When establishing a study environment, consider:</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.3.1.<b>&nbsp;Time
of Day.</b>&nbsp;If possible, schedule your most challenging courses and most
intense study sessions when you are most alert. Determine if you feel more
alert and productive during the morning, midday, or evening, and schedule
accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Posture
and Mobility.</b>&nbsp;Some people prefer to sit at a table or desk (formal
posture); others learn more easily sitting comfortably on a sofa or lying on
the floor (informal); others need to move around when they study. Some people
can sit and study for long periods of time (high persistence), while others
need frequent breaks (low persistence). Recognize your posture and mobility
needs when you to plan.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.3.3.<b>&nbsp;Sound.</b>&nbsp;Not
everyone needs to study in a perfectly quiet environment; if you like sound
when you study, try to make it an environment where the kinds of sounds won t
actually be distracters.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.3.4.<b>&nbsp;Lighting.</b>&nbsp;Reading
ability can be affected by the amount and type of lighting in your study area,
and contrast between text and paper color. Be aware that light does make a
difference, and choose a study environment that best matches your learning
preferences.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.3.5.&nbsp;<b>Temperature.</b>&nbsp;You
may not be able to control the room temperature, but you should be aware of
your temperature preferences and dress accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.4.1.&nbsp;<b>Be a
Lifelong Learner.</b>&nbsp;Technological advances have occurred in exponential
leaps over the past century, and the only certainty in life is change.
Education is the key to preparing you for change. Your most valuable asset and
skill is your ability to learn and apply knowledge gained through education.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Setting
Goals.&nbsp;</b>Setting goals is a good way to accomplish a particularly
difficult task, such as developing study skills. Setting SMART goals will have
you studying like a pro in no time. SMART goals are:</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.4.2.1.&nbsp;<b>Specific.</b>&nbsp;Once
you identify what you want to work on, narrow that down to a single, specific
thing. Working out one problem at a time may make it easier to reach your goal
without spreading yourself too thin.  I want to be a better reader  is broad,
so a more specific goal would be  I want to improve my reading speed.  Write
your specific goal on a piece of paper.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.4.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Measurable.&nbsp;</b>You
won t know if you met your goal if you cannot measure it in some way. For
instance, instead of  I want to improve my reading speed,  a measurable goal
would be  I want to improve my reading speed by 10 words per minute. </span></p>

<p><span>24.3.4.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Action.&nbsp;</b>This
is where you decide how to achieve your goal. Write this part as an explanatory
activity. For example, your goal might now be  I want to improve my reading
speed by 10 words a minute. I will do this by skimming over words like  the 
and  an . </span></p>

<p><span>24.3.4.2.4.<b>&nbsp;Realistic.&nbsp;</b>Make
sure your goals are achievable.  I will improve my reading speed by memorizing
every word in the dictionary  is unrealistic for most people. Everyone has
limits (time, resources, ability, etc.). Do not ignore limits or you may set
unrealistic goals.</span></p>

<p><span>24.3.4.2.5.&nbsp;<b>Timeline.&nbsp;</b>Set
a suspense date, and make sure it is both specific and realistic for you.  I
will meet this goal sometime over the summer  is vague.  I will meet this goal
by the first day of&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.howtodothings.com/education/a1837-how-to-set-goals-to-improve-study-skills.html"><span>school</span></a><a href="http://www.howtodothings.com/education/a1837-how-to-set-goals-to-improve-study-skills.html"><span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>next fall,  is specific and realistic. Your
timeline may be days, months or years, but must be realistic for you and your
lifestyle.</span></p>

<p><b><span>24.4. General Information.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>The MKTS chart is
critical to the Air Force promotion system. The chart is used to help guide the
development of enlisted study guides to support the enlisted promotion system.
Enlisted members should use the chart as a study strategy for the preparation
of their promotion fitness exam or United States Air Force supervisory exam.</span></p>

<p><span>24.4.1. Every 2 years,
members from the enlisted board of director's (CMSAF and major command chiefs)
review the information contain within the study guides and rate the importance
of the information and level of understanding for each promotion grade from
Staff Sergeant to Chief Master Sergeant. The MKTS chart is provided to the
subject-matter experts tasked to write the promotion fitness exam and United
States Air Force supervisory exam.</span></p>

<p><span>24.4.2. The MKTS chart
is located at attachment 1 of study guides. The MKTS chart also provides the
opportunity to provide each enlisted grade a promotion study guide based on the

<p><b><i><span>Section 24E Know Your
Learning Style</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>24.5.<i>&nbsp;</i>Adult Learning Style Profile.</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Adapted from Learning
Style Form, developed by Dr. Ray Barsch; University of Northwestern Ohio
Virtual College, Learning Styles Evaluation.</span></p>

<p><span>24.5.1. The statements
in Figure 24.1 are designed to help an individual determine their learning
style (visual, auditory, or tactile/kinesthetic). No learning style is better
than any other. However, knowing your preferred learning style and tailoring
your study sessions to that style will help you retain more of the material.
Follow the directions in Figure 24.1 to begin discovering your preferred
learning style.</span></p>

<p align="center"><b><span>PROFESSIONALISM</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 25A Overview</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>25.1 Introduction:</span></b></p>

<p><span>25.1.1. The Profession
of Arms requires unique expertise to fulfill our collective responsibility to
the American people.&nbsp;It is distinguished from others in society
because of our expertise in the justified application of lethal military force
and the willingness of those who serve to die for our Nation. Our profession is
defined by our values, ethics, standards, skills and attributes.</span></p>

<p><span>25.1.2. The U.S. Air
Force and its Airmen wield our Nation's most powerful and responsive weapons.
Every member of the U.S. Air Force team--Regular Air Force, Guard, Reserve and
civilian--is entrusted with the responsibility of preserving U.S. national
security. We provide vital skills to help ensure the Air Force is ready to
answer our Nation's call. The trust placed by the Nation in our Airmen rests
upon confidence in the character and competency of the men and women who serve.
To continue this trust we must maintain and project power within the boundaries
of a very sacred and honored Air Force ideal one based on our Air Force Core
Values of&nbsp;<i>Integrity First, Service Before Self&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Excellence
In All We Do</i>. Guided by these Core Values, the Air Force will continue to
develop and inspire our Airmen within the Profession of Arms.</span></p>

<p><span>25.1.3. We are worthy of
the Nation's trust through actions consistent with our Air Force Core Values
summarized in one word: professionalism. As a service we maintain the trust of
our Nation by integrating our Air Force Core Values into mission accomplishment
daily, infusing professionalism into everything we do. Professionalism
describes who we are as a service; how we conduct ourselves and live our lives;
and it sets the standards to which all Airmen will be expected to adhere and
exceed. Professionalism is about learning to lead oneself it is not just about
what we do but also how we do it. Professionalism within the Air Force is
framed by the requirement for trust, loyalty, dignity and personal commitment.
Professionalism is the heart and soul of who we are and who we aspire to be
every day. Our sense of professionalism underlies the pride we feel when we
say&nbsp;<i>I am an American Airman</i>.</span></p>

<p><span>25.1.4. This Roadmap is
universal and reaches across every element and operation within the Air Force.
Whether in war or peace, at home or abroad, on or off duty, our Airmen must
hold true to the sacred trust our institution requires. A trust that respects
all our fellow Airmen strives to bring out the best version of our people,
commits to a higher calling of service and holds those who fail to maintain the
honor our standards demand fully accountable. As Airmen we continually seek to
deepen and foster our commitment to high personal standards of conduct.
Ultimately, we instill and value who we are as Airmen within the Profession of
Arms as our hallmark to shape and sustain Air Force culture today and well into
the future.</span></p>

<p><span>25.1.5. In direct
support of the objectives outlined in this Roadmap, we established the
Profession of Arms Center of Excellence (PACE) as an Air Force-level Center on
March 2, 2015. PACE will champion our focused commitment to collaborating,
coordinating and developing areas of growth and leadership for all of our
Airmen. PACE, working closely with organizations across the Air Force, will
help to provide deliberate, institution-wide strategies focused on supporting
professionalism efforts with a common goal of enriching and enhancing the Air
Force Profession of Arms. As a dedicated champion to the Air Force Profession
of Arms, PACE will provide leadership, education and connectivity with current
and emerging cylinders of excellence currently focused on enhancing human
capital within the unique Profession of Arms. Through PACE, the Air Force
senior leadership has a dedicated institution for direct focus and ability to
modify specific Air Force requirements within the Profession of Arms. This
Roadmap outlines an expectation, mindset and standard for which all future PACE
operations will focus. An electronic copy of the Strategic Roadmap is available

Vision:&nbsp;<i>Airmen who do the RIGHT thing - the RIGHT way - for the RIGHT
reason.</i></span></b></p>

<p><span>The future of the U.S.
Air Force rests on the degree to which we can continue to attract, recruit,
develop and retain individuals committed to the Profession of Arms and Air
Force Core Values. Airmen must be trusted professionals with exemplary
character, judgment and competence, who hold themselves and their fellow Airmen
accountable. As a profession, these characteristics are expected and directed
for both individuals who serve in the Air Force as well as for the institution
itself.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span>Section 25C America s
Air Force: A Profession of Arms.</span></i></b></p>

<p><b><span>25.7 The Little Blue Book.</span></b></p>

<p><span>First, we must
understand that our chosen profession is that of a higher calling, in which we
hold ourselves to higher standards. To serve proudly and capably, our
commitment to our cause must be unbreakable; it must be bonded in our mutual
respect for each other. Throughout our service we are guided and reminded of
this awesome responsibility to our nation. The oaths we take remind us that we
serve freely in support and defense of our Constitution. Our Air Force Core Values
serve as our compass and provide the fortified foundation of our service. We
abide by a Code of Conduct that captures our resolve, while our Airman's Creed
highlights the strength of our diverse Airmen who fly, fight and win as one Air
Force. We are the world's greatest Air Force...powered by Airmen, fueled by
innovation; this book serves as a guide to the principles that make us so
strong. Wherever you are in your Air Force career, it is a reminder to the
meaning of service in our profession...The Profession of Arms.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.1.<b>&nbsp;A Profession of Arms:</b></span></p>

<p><span>25.7.1.1. No profession
asks more of its members than the Profession of Arms. As we state in our
Airman's Creed, we have answered our nation's call. It is a higher calling, and
it comes with a higher standard.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.1.2. General Ronald
Fogleman, our 15th Chief of Staff once said,  We are not engaged in just
another job; we are practitioners of the Profession of Arms. We are entrusted
with the security of our nation, the protection of our citizens and the preservation
of its way of life. In this capacity, we serve as guardians of America s
future. By its very nature, this responsibility requires us to place the needs
of our service and our country before personal concerns. </span></p>

<p><span>25.7.1.3. That
responsibility was given to each and every one of us when we raised our right
hand and swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
When we joined our Air Force with a sacred oath, we accepted a sacred trust
from the American people, one that goes beyond anything else in society. As
members of a joint team, our profession is distinguished from others because of
our expertise in the justified application of lethal military force and the
willingness of those who serve to pay the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. No
other profession expects its members to lay down their lives for their friends,
families or freedoms...but it's what our profession readily expects.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.1.4. And make no
mistake, this is a profession. We are professionals. As volunteers, our sworn obligation
is to the Constitution. Fighting America's wars is an ugly business - there is
nothing pretty about it, cool about it or glorious about it - but it must be
done, and somebody must be good at it. We re good at it. Our status as the
world's greatest Air Force was earned by the men and women who have gone before
us, and is carried on by every Airman who wears the uniform today.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.1.5. All service
men and women belong to the Profession of Arms, from the most junior enlisted
to our most senior leaders. We are all accountable for meeting ethical and
performance standards in our actions and similarly accountable for our failure
to take action, when appropriate. The distinction between ranks lies solely in
our level of responsibility and the degree of accountability...not in our level
of commitment to the Profession of Arms. We share the common attributes of
character, courage and competence. We qualify as professionals through
intensive training, education and practical experience. As professionals, we
are defined by our strength of character, a life- long commitment to core
values and a dedication to maintain our professional abilities through
continuous improvement, individually and institutionally.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.1.6. We must
remember above all else, we are patriots first. As service men and women we,
more than anyone else, understand the price paid for freedom. We, more than
anyone else, understand the sacrifices that come from willingly serving our
country. We, more than anyone else, understand what it means to serve in the
Profession of Arms.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.2.<b>&nbsp;Respect:</b></span></p>

<p><span>25.7.2.1. Respect is at
the root of the Profession of Arms and bonds every Airman who voluntarily
serves. Respect is the feeling of esteem or deference for a person or other
entity, but in the Air Force it takes on a greater meaning and importance.
Respect is the lifeblood of our profession. Without it, we simply cannot stand
strong in the defense of our nation. Mutual respect strengthens our team and
eliminates seams that reveal a weakness in the force.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.2.2. Respect in the
Profession of Arms goes beyond professional courtesy. It means accepting others
for who they are, embracing a heightened personal sense of humility and
fostering an environment of inclusiveness in which every Airman is able and eager
to offer their skills, abilities and ideas. It means treating the equipment and
resources in our possession with care, understanding and embracing the power of
diversity and holding those who mistreat others accountable. More than
anything, we must respect the humbling mission placed in our hands by the
American people, and the impact our weapons and our actions can have around the
globe.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.2.3. Our Air Force
is a critical part of the greatest fighting force the world has ever known;
it's powered by the greatest Airmen the world has ever seen. Through respect
for each other, our resources and our mission, we will continue to provide
Global Vigilance, Global Reach and Global Power for America.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.<b>&nbsp;Air Force Core Values.&nbsp;</b></span></p>

<p><span>Values represent
enduring, guiding principles for which we as individuals or organizations
stand.  Core  values are so fundamental that they define our very identity. The
United States Air Force has clearly defined its identity by these three simple
values: Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.</span></p>

<p><span>For those of us who join
this proud community of Airmen - whether officer, enlisted, civilian, Active,
Guard, or Reserve - being a part of the Air Force family requires we commit to
living these values, on and off duty. This is the expectation of our
profession, and is the standard against which our fellow service members and
the American public hold us. The Air Force Professional is a trusted servant of
our Nation who adheres to the highest standards of character, courage and
competence. How we act represents to countless others the collective identity
of the United States Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.1.<b>&nbsp;The Challenge. Living the Core
Values:</b></span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.1.1.<b>&nbsp;</b>Understanding
the Core Values is relatively easy. The true challenge is to live them. It's a
commitment that never ends, and one that always matters.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.1.2.<b>&nbsp;</b>We
all have the ability to display integrity, both professionally and personally.
We have all placed ourselves in a position to serve a greater purpose. And we
all have the innate desire to achieve excellence. Yet there will be moments
where living and acting by the Core Values will be challenging.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.1.3.<b>&nbsp;</b>These
moments are also opportunities to prove, through our actions, that we truly
embody these Core Values. In doing so, we honor the heritage and continue the
legacy of those who served before us and sacrificed so much. It is through this
alignment of our actions with these values that we, as an Air Force, earn the
public's trust, strengthen our Service, and accomplish our mission. These are
the Core Values of our Air Force.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.1.4.<b>&nbsp;</b>Each
of these Core Values is further defined by virtues (desired behaviors and
characteristics) we must practice and demonstrate in our daily lives, showing
we truly do value Integrity, Service and Excellence. Consistently practicing
these virtues results in habits of honorable thought and action, producing an
Air Force Professional. Air Force Professionalism is a shared belief in, and a
commitment to, honorable service based on our Air Force Core Values.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.2.<b>&nbsp;Integrity First:</b></span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.2.1. Integrity is
simply doing the right thing, all the time, whether everyone is watching or no
one is watching. It is the compass that keeps us on the right path when we are
confronted with ethical challenges and personal temptations, and it is the
foundation upon which trust is built. An individual realizes integrity when
thoughts and actions align with what he or she knows to be right. The virtues
that demonstrate one truly values integrity include:</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.2.2.&nbsp;<b>Honesty
is the hallmark of integrity.</b>&nbsp;As public servants, we are trusted
agents. Honesty requires us to evaluate our performance against standards, and
to conscientiously and accurately report findings. It drives us to advance our
skills and credentials through our own effort. The service member's word must
be unquestionable. This is the only way to preserve the trust we hold so dear
with each other and with the population we serve.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.2.3.&nbsp;<b>Courage
is not the absence of fear, but doing the right thing despite the fear.</b>&nbsp;Courage
empowers us to take necessary personal or professional risks, make decisions
that may be unpopular, and admit to our mistakes; having the courage to take
these actions is crucial for the mission, the Air Force, and the Nation.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.2.4.&nbsp;<b>Accountability
is responsibility with an audience.</b>&nbsp;That audience may be the American
people, our units, our supervisors, our fellow Airmen, our families, our loved
ones, and even ourselves. Accountable individuals maintain transparency, seek
honest and constructive feedback, and take ownership of the outcomes of their
actions and decisions. They are responsible to themselves and others and
refrain from actions which discredit themselves or our service.</span></p>



<p><span>25.7.3.3.&nbsp;<b>Service Before Self:</b></span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.3.1. Service
before self tells us that professional duties take precedence over personal
desires. The call to serve is a call to live according to a higher standard. It
is not just a job; it is a commitment that takes energy, dedication, and sacrifice.
We do not  work  in the Air Force; we serve in the Air Force. A heart and
mindset for service allows us to embrace expectations and requirements not
levied on the American public or other professions. The virtues that
demonstrate one truly values service include:</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.3.2. Duty is the
obligation to perform what is required for the mission. While our
responsibilities are determined by the law, the Department of Defense, and Air
Force instructions, directives, and guidance, our sense of duty is a personal
one and bound by the oath of service we took as individuals. Duty sometimes
calls for sacrifice in ways no other profession has or will. Airmen who truly
embody Service Before Self consistently choose to make necessary sacrifices to
accomplish the mission, and in doing so, we honor those who made the ultimate
sacrifice.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.3.3. Loyalty is
an internal commitment to the success and preservation of something bigger than
ourselves. Our loyalty is to the Nation first, the values and commitments of
our Air Force second, and finally to the men and women with whom we serve.
Loyalty to our leaders requires us to trust, follow, and execute their
decisions, even when we disagree. We offer alternative solutions and innovative
ideas most effectively through the chain of command. Ultimately, loyalty is
demonstrated by helping each other act with honor.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.3.4. Respect is
treating others with dignity and valuing them as individuals. We must always
act knowing that all Airmen possess fundamental worth as human beings. We must
treat others with the utmost dignity and respect, understanding that our
diversity is a great source of strength.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.4.&nbsp;<b>Excellence In All We Do:</b></span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.4.1. Excellence
in all we do does not mean that we demand perfection in everything from
everyone. Instead, this value directs us to continuously advance our craft and
increase our knowledge as Airmen. We must have a passion for continuous
improvement and innovation that propels America's Air Force in quantum leaps
towards accomplishment and performance.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.4.2.&nbsp;<b>Mission
focus encompasses operations, product and resources excellence.</b>&nbsp;The
complex undertaking of the Air Force mission requires us to harness the
ingenuity, expertise, and elbow grease of all Airmen. We approach it with the
mindset of stewardship, initiative, improvement, pride, and a continued
commitment to anticipate and embrace change. Our work areas, our processes, and
our interpersonal interactions must be undeniably professional and positive.
Our people are the platform for delivering innovative ideas, strategies, and
technologies to the fight.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.4.3.&nbsp;<b>Discipline
is an individual commitment to uphold the highest of personal and professional
standards.</b>&nbsp;Airmen commit to a life of discipline and self-control. We
demonstrate it in attitude, work ethic, and effort directed at continuous
improvement, whether it be pursuing professional military education or
nurturing ourselves physically, intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually.
Each Airman represents the entire Air Force. Our appearance, actions, and words
shape the culture of the Air Force and the reputation of the entire military
profession.</span></p>

<p><span>25.7.3.4.4.&nbsp;<b>Teamwork
is essential to triumph at every level.</b>&nbsp;Airmen recognize the
interdependency of every member's contributions towards the mission and strive
for organizational excellence. We not only give our personal best, but also
challenge and motivate each other. We carry our own weight, and whenever
necessary, help our wingmen carry theirs. We serve in the greatest Air Force in
the world, and we embrace the idea that our part of the Air Force meets that
world-class standard.</span></p>

<p><b><span>25.8. Conclusion.&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><span>Continuing to do things
the same way we always have is sure to lead to the same results we have already
seen. Our Air Force of the 21</span><sup><span>st</span></sup><span>&nbsp;Century can t
afford to do what we have always done we must continue to transform ourselves!
We must work today to transform the Air Force of tomorrow to meet our next
challenges. The foundation of our Air Force professionalism resides in our
commitment and the oath we took to serve our country. Let's work together today
to strengthen an environment that allows all Airmen to build trust and
credibility with the nation they serve and start to forge our place in the
future evolution and superiority of our Air Force.</span></p>
