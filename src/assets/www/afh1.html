    preparation for your entry into the Air Force, this section will introduce the
    Air Force mission and their evolution, the machines and technology associated
    with air and space flight and most importantly, the legacy of the men and women
    of the United States Air Force. By surveying the history of aviation, you will
    discover our heritage, appreciate Air Force traditions, and understand your
    role in our nation's defense. This United States Air Force Historical
    Perspective is by Dr. John T. Farquhar from the United States Air Force Academy
    Department of History and contributing editor George W. Bradley III, the Air

    <p id="P-22"><span id="SPAN-23">1.2.1. The dream of
    flight recurs in myth and legend from ancient times, but not until two French
    brothers, Joseph Michel and Jacques Etienne Montgolfier, launched a hot air
    balloon on 15 October 1783, with passenger Jean Fran ois Pilatre de Rozier, did
    man first  fly.  The military potential of aviation was noted in 1794, when the
    French  Aerostatic Corps' balloons accompanied the armies of the French
    Revolution until 1798.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-24"><span id="SPAN-25"><img width="211" height="158" src="afh1_files/image001.png" id="IMG-26"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-27"><b id="B-28"><i id="I-29"><span id="SPAN-30">Inflating the Civil War balloon Intrepid, 1862</span></i></b></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-31"><span id="SPAN-32">1.2.2. In September
    1861, a  Balloon Corps' provided aerial observation for the Union Army during
    the American Civil War. However, the early balloons proved fragile, vulnerable
    to weather, and of limited value.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33"><span id="SPAN-34">1.2.3. Aviation languished
    in the United States, but in Europe, balloons, gliders, and aerodynamics
    advanced rapidly. By 1853, Britain's Sir George Cayley created a glider with
    fixed wings, cambered airfoil, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers.
    Continuing Cayley's work, German engineer Otto Lilienthal produced flying
    machines similar to today's hang gliders. From 1891 until his death five years
    later, Lilienthal greatly advanced aerodynamic theory. The publicity generated
    by Lilienthal spurred on imaginative people on both sides of the Atlantic,
    including Orville and Wilbur Wright.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35"><span id="SPAN-36">1.2.4. The Wrights
    furthered Lilienthal's experiments with the assistance of American Octave
    Chanute, whose book,&nbsp;<i id="I-37">Progress in Flying Machines</i>, provided their
    foundation in aeronautics. From 1900 to 1902, the Wrights conducted more than
    1,000 glides from Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. After
    perfecting wing warping, elevators and rudders, and a water-cooled engine, they
    attempted the first powered flight on 14 December 1903. On that try, the
    aircraft stalled upon takeoff and crashed three seconds later. Success came at
    10:35, on 17 December 1903, when Orville Wright flew 120 feet in 12 seconds.
    Alternating pilot duties, the brothers made three more flights with Wilbur
    flying 852 feet and staying aloft 59 seconds on the fourth attempt.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-38"><span id="SPAN-39">1.2.5. American military
    authorities rejected the Wrights' flyer, reacting in part to the highly
    publicized failure of Samuel P. Langley's steam-powered Aerodrome in October
    1903. Although a highly respected scientist and Secretary of the Smithsonian
    Institution, Langley and the Army were subjected to public ridicule and
    Congressional criticism for the  waste  of a $50,000 government grant. Only
    when President Theodore Roosevelt intervened was an aeronautical division
    established in the United States Army's Signal Corps on 1 August 1907.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-40"><span id="SPAN-41">1.2.6. With the
    establishment of an aeronautical division the army was in possession of several
    balloons. The Army required trained enlisted men to conduct balloon inflations
    and effect necessary repairs. Effective 2 July 1907, Eddy Ward and Jason
    Barrett reported to the Leo Stevens' balloon factory in New York City. They
    would become the first enlisted men assigned to the Signal Corps' small
    Aeronautical Division, which in time evolved into the United States Air Force
    enlisted corps.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-42"><span id="SPAN-43"><img width="148" height="200" src="afh1_files/image002.png" id="IMG-44"></span></p>

    <p id="P-51"><span id="SPAN-52">1.2.7. When Ward and
    Barrett reported, the division did not officially exist. The Army had disbanded
    the minuscule Civil War balloon service in 1863, and the corps' attempts to
    revive military aviation met with little success. At the balloon factory, the
    two men were schooled in the rudiments of fabric handling, folding, and
    stitching; in the manufacturing of buoyant gases; and in the inflation and
    control of the Army's  aircraft. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-53"><span id="SPAN-54">1.2.8. On 13 August
    1907, Ward and Barrett were ordered to report to Camp John Smith outside
    Norfolk, Virginia, to participate in the Jamestown Exposition celebrating the
    300th anniversary of the first settlement of Virginia. Over the next few years,
    the detachment participated in numerous air shows and moved from location to
    location. Barrett left the Army to complete a career in the Navy, but the
    enlisted detachment was soon expanded to include eight others. These nine men
    were the nucleus from which America's enlisted air arm grew. They were the
    first of a small band of enlisted Airmen who, during the decade before World
    War I, shared in the experimental and halting first steps to establish military
    aviation as a permanent part of the Nation's defense. Never numbering more than
    a few hundred individuals, the enlisted crews of the Signal Corps' Aeronautical
    Division provided day-to-day support for a handful of officer pilots, learned
    the entirely new skills of airplane  mechanician  and later, mechanic, rigger,
    and fitter met daunting transportation and logistical challenges, and
    contributed mightily to the era's seat-of-the-pants technological advances.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-55"><span id="SPAN-56">1.2.9. A few enlisted
    men, against official and semi-official military prejudice, learned to fly. The
    majority of enlisted men were absorbed in the tasks of getting the fragile
    balloons and even flimsier planes of the day into the air and keeping them
    there. Of necessity flexible and innovative, early crews often had to rebuild
    aircraft from the ground up after every crash and, in those early days of
    flight; crashes were the rule rather than the exception. Enlisted crews not
    only repaired the planes, they labored to make some of the more ill-designed craft
    airworthy in the first place.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-57"><b id="B-58"><span id="SPAN-59">1.3. The Early Days of the United States Army
    Aviation (1907-1917):</span></b></p>
    
    
    
    <p align="center" id="P-60"><span id="SPAN-61"><img width="255" height="148" src="afh1_files/image003.png" id="IMG-62"></span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-63"><b id="B-64"><span id="SPAN-65">&nbsp; Wright brothers at
    Kitty Hawk</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-66"><span id="SPAN-67">1.3.1. By December 1907,
    the new Aeronautical Division of the Signal Corps established specifications
    for an American military aircraft. The flying machine had to carry two people
    (with a combined weight of 350 pounds or less), and fly for 125 miles at an average
    speed of 40 miles per hour (mph). The Army received 41 bids, but only one,
    submitted by the Wright brothers, produced a flyable aircraft. By September
    1908, the Wright Type  A  Military Flyer flew for more than an hour at a
    maximum altitude of 310 feet, carrying the first military observer, Lieutenant
    Frank P. Lahm. A subsequent test on 17 September 1908 resulted in the first
    military aviation fatality: Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge. On 30 July 1909,
    pilot Orville Wright and Lieutenant Benjamin D. Foulois flew from Fort Myer to
    Alexandria, Virginia, at an average speed of 42.6 mph. The Army accepted the
    plane 2 August 1909 and awarded the Wrights $25,000 and a $5,000 bonus.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-68"><span id="SPAN-69">1.3.2. The United States
    Army's early air operations were not promising. In October 1909, Wilbur Wright
    trained Lieutenants Frank P. Lahm and Frederic E. Humphreys to fly; on 26
    October, they were the first Army pilots to fly solo.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-70"><span id="SPAN-71">By 5 November, they
    crashed the Army's plane and within weeks were transferred out of aviation. In
    March 1910, Lieutenant Foulois received orders to become the Signal Corps 
    pilot. Chief of the Signal Corps, Gen James Allen, told him,  Don t worry.
    You ll learn the techniques as you go along...just take plenty of spare parts
    and teach yourself to fly. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-72"><span id="SPAN-73">1.3.3. United States
    military aviation was falling behind Europe. By the end of 1911, the French had
    produced 353 aviators versus 26 American pilots, of whom only eight were
    military. By 1913, France and Germany each had spent $22 million on military
    aviation; Russia spent $12 million; and even Belgium spent $2 million, compared
    to just $430,000 for the United States.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-74"><span id="SPAN-75">1.3.4. Increased
    appropriations over the ensuing two years allowed the Army to purchase more
    aircraft. By October 1912, the Aeronautical Division had 11 aircraft, 14 flying
    officers, and 39 enlisted mechanics. On 28 September 1912, one of these
    mechanics, Corporal Frank Scott, became the first enlisted person to die in an
    accident in a military aircraft. A crew chief, Scott was flying as a passenger
    when the aircraft's pilot lost control and the aircraft dived to earth. Scott
    Field, now Scott Air Force Base, in Illinois, was named in his honor. On 5
    March 1913, the 1st Aero Squadron (Provisional) was activated becoming the
    oldest Air Force squadron.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-76"><span id="SPAN-77">1.3.5. After years of
    testing, improvising, and operating on little more than dedication and a
    shoestring, Army aviation finally received official status by the passage of
    United States House Resolution 5304 on 18 July 1914. This bill authorized the
    Signal Corps to establish an aviation section consisting of 60 officers and 260
    enlisted men. The bill created the military rating of aviation mechanician,
    which called for a 50 percent pay increase for enlisted men  instructed in the
    art of flying  while they were on flying status. The number of such personnel
    was limited to 40, and the law specified that no more than a dozen enlisted men
    could be trained as aviators.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-78"><span id="SPAN-79">1.3.6. America's first
    aviation combat experience demonstrated that the air arm was not prepared.
    After Francisco  Pancho  Villa's Mexican forces raided Columbus, New Mexico, in
    March 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered the 1st Aero Squadron to accompany
    a force he was organizing to protect the border and to apprehend Pancho Villa.
    The squadron, commanded by Captain Foulois, sought to provide aerial scouting
    for the ground forces. Mustering 11 pilot officers, 82 enlisted men, and one
    civilian mechanic, the squadron departed from San Antonio with eight Curtiss
    JN-3  Jennies,  ten trucks, and six motorcycles. On the train, Foulois picked
    up two enlisted hospital corpsmen. An officer and 14 enlisted men of the
    engineering section joined them. In spite of the 1st Aero Squadron s
    reconnaissance flights and several deliveries of mail and dispatches, readily
    apparent was the squadron's JN type aeroplane was not powerful enough to
    operate at the 5,000-foot elevations of the Casa Grande, and mountain weather,
    dust, and extreme temperatures wreaked havoc with Foulois' underpowered,
    dilapidated Curtis JN-3 Jennies. By 19 April, only two of the eight planes were
    in working condition. The rest had fallen victim to landing accidents and
    forced landings, and all had suffered from the heat and sand.<b id="B-80">&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-81"><span id="SPAN-82">1.3.7. After 11 months
    of fruitless campaigning, the so-called Punitive Expedition was recalled in
    February 1917, and Villa continued to lead rebels in northern Mexico until
    1920. Yet, poorly equipped as it was the 1st Aero Squadron had acquitted itself
    admirably. In his final report on the mission, Major Foulois praised his
    pilots, who because of poor climbing characteristics of the aircraft, could not
    carry sufficient food or even adequate clothing. Foulois also commended the
    willingness of his pilots to fly clearly dangerous aircraft. He did not neglect
    the enlisted personnel; he praised them for their dedication and willingness to
    work day and night to keep the aircraft flying. If the performance was
    admirable, the fact remains that the results of this first demonstration of
    American air power were deeply disappointing. Yet Foulois and the others
    learned valuable lessons about the realities of aviation under field
    conditions. Adequate maintenance was essential, as were plenty of backup
    aircraft, which could be rotated into service while other airplanes were removed
    from the line and repaired. Enlisted and civilian mechanics faced a myriad of
    problems; in particular, the laminated wood propellers pulled apart. In
    response, the mechanics developed a humidor facility to maximize the life of
    the props.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-83"><span id="SPAN-84">1.3.8. Army brass
    persisted in discouraging the training of enlisted men, and if not for officers
    such as Billy Mitchell and Hap Arnold, who developed a deep and abiding respect
    for enlisted personnel in military aviation, there probably would have been
    even fewer enlisted aviators than the law allowed. The Signal Corps authority
    to train more enlisted men was largely through the efforts of Mitchell and the
    National Defense Act of 3 June 1916. When the United States entered World War
    I, however, there were no more than a dozen non-officers qualified as pilots.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-85"><b id="B-86"><span id="SPAN-87">1.4. The First Air War:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-88"><span id="SPAN-89">1.4.1. Aircraft and
    aerial warfare evolved during the first World War, 1914-1918. Observation,
    artillery spotting, and reconnaissance emerged as the airplane's most important
    war missions. By 1915, pursuit aircraft were developed to deny the enemy use of
    the air. After early attempts to down enemies with handguns, French pilot
    Roland Garros attached steel plates to the propeller of his Morane-Saulnier
    Type L monoplane, enabling him to fire a machine gun through the propeller arc.
    He earned wide acclaim as the war's first  ace.  When engine trouble forced
    Garros to land behind enemy lines on 19 April 1915, the Germans studied his
    innovation. Dutch-born Anthony Fokker then created the first true fighter
    plane, the Fokker Eindecker, using an interrupter gear to enable a machine gun
    to fire through the propeller. By the end of World War I, Airmen had pioneered
    most of today's aerial missions, including photographic reconnaissance, close
    air support for ground troops, battlefield interdiction, and day and nighttime
    strategic bombardment. The German air service inaugurated long-range strategic
    bombardment as early as 1915 with their massive Zeppelin dirigibles.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-90"><span id="SPAN-91">1.4.2. Despite the
    importance of reconnaissance and artillery spotting, fighter pilots captured
    the public's imagination. Newspapers portrayed the daring, skill, and chivalry
    of the  knights of the air.  Following Roland Garros, the French produced such
    aces as Rene Fonck, with 75 kills, and Georges Guynemer, with 54 aerial
    victories.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-92"><span id="SPAN-93">1.4.3. Like the allies,
    Germany publicized  aces' to foster public support for the war effort.
    Germany's first ace, Max Immelmann, developed a revolutionary technique to
    reverse direction of an aircraft in flight. The technique still bears his name.
    Manfred von Richtofen, perhaps the most famous ace of all, flew a scarlet
    Fokker triplane, earning him the name,  the Red Baron.  Shortly after his 80th
    victory, Richtofen was shot down and killed on 21 April 1918.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-94"><span id="SPAN-95">1.4.4. Not to be outdone
    by the French and Germans, Britain exulted in the exploits of fighter pilots.
    Britain's leading ace, with 73 kills, was Edward  Mick  Mannock, who was killed
    by ground fire while aiding a novice wingman.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-96"><span id="SPAN-97">1.4.5. As early as 1915,
    Americans flew in the European war, both with the French and the British though
    it was the American-manned Lafayette Escadrille of France that earned the
    greatest and most enduring fame. The French air service established the&nbsp;<i id="I-98">Escadrille
    Americaine</i>&nbsp;for American volunteers on 21 March 1916. Later renamed
    the&nbsp;<i id="I-99">Lafayette Escadrille</i>, this squadron flew French Nieuport 17
    fighters and provided valuable experience when the United States entered the
    war. French-born American Raoul Lufbery shot down 17 German planes before
    transferring to the American Air Service, where he commanded the famous  Hat in
    the Ring  94th Aero Squadron, before his death on 19 May 1918.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-100"><span id="SPAN-101">1.4.6.
    A little-acknowledged fact about the Lafayette Escadrille is the roster of
    aviators included an enlisted man who was also an African-American one of the
    very few enlisted Americans to fly in the war Corporal Eugene Bullard was the
    son of a Georgia former slave. As a member of the French Foreign Legion, he was
    awarded the Croix de Guerre (one of 15 decorations from the French government)
    and was wounded four times before the legion gave him a disability discharge.
    During his convalescence in Paris, he bet an American $2,000 that he could
    learn to fly and become a combat aviator. Corporal Bullard won the bet by
    completing training and joining the Lafayette Escadrille. Styling himself the
     Black Swallow of Death,  he claimed two victories. Despite his record of
    daring and dedication, he was grounded at the request of American officers
    attached to the escadrille. When the escadrille pilots were reorganized and
    incorporated into the American Expeditionary Force, Bullard was denied the
    officer's commission accorded to other American escadrille aviators and to most
    of the handful of white enlisted men who had earned their wings in regular
    United States Army outfits.</span></p>

    <p id="P-123"><span id="SPAN-124">&nbsp;1.4.7. Of the 767 United States pilots and
    481 observers in action in 1918, Capt Edward V.  Eddie  Rickenbacker and
    Lieutenant Frank Luke, Jr., achieved the most fame. Rickenbacker was a renowned
    race car driver before the war. Older than most pilots, the 28-year-old became
    America's  Ace of Aces' with 26 confirmed kills. Frank Luke was the only pilot
    awarded the Medal of Honor during the war (Rickenbacker would be awarded one in
    1931). Known as the  Arizona Balloon Buster,  Luke downed 14 German balloons
    and four aircraft in 17 days. His spectacular career ended on 29 September 1918
    during a solo attack, when he shot down three enemy balloons and two aircraft
    before enemy ground fire forced him down. Seriously wounded, he died with a
    pistol in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-125"><span id="SPAN-126">1.4.8. Enlisted men flew
    before, during, and after World War I but their status remained vague. On 22
    January 1919, the commanding officer of the Air Mechanics School at Kelly Field
    sought to clarify the situation by asking the Office of Military Aeronautics
    for a definition of  enlisted aviator  and  aerial flier.  The Kelly commanding
    officer wanted to know who exactly was entitled to wear the enlisted aviator
    insignia on the upper-right shoulder of his tunic. The reply came on 31
    January,   you are advised that although uniform regulations and specifications
    provide for an insignia to be worn by enlisted aviators, the grade itself has
    never been created and consequently there is no one in the service entitled to
    wear the insignia provided for such grade.  In other words, enlisted aviators,
    who had served as instructors, ferry pilots, test pilots, and mechanical
    flight-check pilots, did not exist at least not officially.</span></p>

    the handful of World War I enlisted aviators who immediately followed him were
    the first of some 3,000 enlisted personnel who would fly between the wars and into
    the early months of World War II. The military withheld official flying status
    from these men until Congress enacted Public Law 99 in 1941, which provided for
    training enlisted  aviation students,  who were  awarded the rating of pilot
    and warranted as a staff sergeant.  Late in 1942, however, Congress passed the
    Flight Officer Act (Public Law 658), which automatically promoted sergeant
    pilots produced by the Staff Sergeant Pilot Program to flight officers. Thus,
    the cockpit was effectively reserved  for the commissioned.  One enlisted
    pilot, Sergeant William C. Ocker, inspired to fly by watching Vernon Burge,
    received his commission in January 1917 and commanded a flight school in
    Pennsylvania. However, before this his flying skills made Ocker a valuable
    commodity in the Aviation Section. Known as the  Father of Blind Flight,  Ocker
    flight-tested modified aircraft, served as a flight instructor, and was
    hand-picked to scout various parcels for future airfields near the Potomac
    River. One of the tracts he selected became Bolling Field, Washington District
    of Columbia.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-141"><span id="SPAN-142">1.4.10. Master Sergeant
    George H. Holmes was the last of about 2,500 men who graduated from enlisted
    pilot training. He became a pilot in 1921 and was eventually promoted to
    lieutenant colonel during World War II. When the war ended, he chose to revert
    to his enlisted rank of master sergeant. He was the last enlisted pilot to
    serve and retired in 1957.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-143"><span id="SPAN-144">1.4.11. In addition to
    the specialized roles directly associated with flying, Air Service enlisted
    personnel<b id="B-145">&nbsp;</b>performed a wide variety of general support functions in
    administration, mess, transport, and the medical corps. Construction personnel,
    who built the airfields, hangars, barracks, and other buildings, were often the
    first enlisted men stationed at various overseas locations.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-146"><span id="SPAN-147">1.4.12. World War I
    Airmen were not combat soldiers as such, but enlisted men who stood guard and
    operated base defense. Given the static nature of the war, there was relatively
    little danger of a base being overrun by ground troops. Air attacks, however,
    happened frequently. Aerial bombardment and strafing techniques improved later
    in the war, and enlisted men received training in the operation of antiaircraft
    machine guns.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-148"><span id="SPAN-149">1.4.13. Enlisted
    personnel also served as observers for both the aircraft and balloon corps. In
    this capacity Sergeant Fred C. Graveline of the 20th Aero Squadron was able to
    receive the Distinguished Flying Cross. Graveline served as an observer and
    aerial gunner from 30 September to 5 November 1918 on 15 missions in the back
    seat of a DH-4. In one 35minute battle in which Graveline remarked he  aged 10
    years,  he helped drive off nearly two dozen German planes, shooting down two.</span></p>

    <p id="P-156"><span id="SPAN-157">1.4.14. While he was not
    an ace, William  Billy  Mitchell emerged as one of the outstanding American air
    combat commanders of the war, in essence the first Combined Forces Air
    Component Commander, as he directed British, French, and American airpower.
    Supremely confident about the efficacy of airpower, Mitchell sometimes clashed
    with his superiors, including aviation pioneer General Foulois. Nevertheless,
    Foulois recognized Mitchell's leadership and recommended him for the top combat
    position, Chief of Air Service, 1st Army. In September 1918, Mitchell massed 1,481
    aircraft of American, French, British, and Italian units to support General
    Pershing's St. Mihiel offensive. Mitchell emphasized concentrated, mass attacks
    to overwhelm enemy airpower and punish German ground forces. In four days,
    Allied Airmen flew 3,300 combat sorties and dropped 75 tons of explosives.
    Lauded as a success by General Pershing, Mitchell refined his tactics during
    the Meuse-Argonne offensive of 26 September 1918, where 700 American aircraft
    faced 500 German planes. By 1918, based upon his outstanding performance
    directing Air Service combat units over the Ch teau-Thierry area, the St.
    Mihiel salient, and the Meuse-Argonne, Mitchell earned the Distinguished
    Service Cross for valor and temporary promotion to brigadier general.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-158"><span id="SPAN-159">1.4.15. By the Armistice
    of 11 November 1918, airpower had played an important role in the Allied
    victory. Although observation, reconnaissance, and artillery spotting remained
    the most significant missions, close air support, interdiction, and strategic
    bombardment showed promise. Eclipsing all other roles, the image of the
    glamorous fighter ace with his brightly painted aircraft, leather jacket, and
    flying scarf captured public attention. The Army Air Service destroyed 781
    enemy aircraft and 73 balloons at a cost of 289 American aircraft, 48 balloons,
    and 569 battle casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-160"><span id="SPAN-161">1.4.16. At the end of
    the war, more than 190,000 men were serving in the Air Service, 74,000 of them
    overseas with the American expeditionary force. On the same day, the Air
    Service halted all inductions of enlisted recruits and began the process of
    dissolving its forces. Combat groups and wings in Europe were disbanded
    immediately, but squadrons remained intact to serve initially as the basic
    demobilization unit structures. Since the Air Service had no clear idea of the
    authorized final strength for the postwar peacetime, it cut loose men in
    wholesale batches. The Army, in general, and the air service, in particular,
    took considerable pains to help discharged enlisted men find jobs after leaving
    the service. The Army worked closely with Federal officials to aid veterans and
    even allowed some men to remain in the service temporarily beyond their
    discharge if they had no prospects for work. Air service commanding officers
    provided special letters of recommendation to former mechanics and technically
    trained enlisted men in an effort to help them find employment.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-162"><span id="SPAN-163">1.4.17. On 20 May 1918,
    President Woodrow Wilson issued an Executive Order that transferred Army
    aviation from under the Signal Corps control to the Secretary of War. Later
    that same month, the Army officially recognized the Bureau of Aircraft
    Production and the Division of Military Aeronautics as the Air Service. World
    War I showed the difficulty of coordinating air activities under the existing
    organization, thus the Army Reorganization Act of 1920 made the Air Service an
    official combat arm of the Army.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-164"><b id="B-165"><span id="SPAN-166">1.5. Controversy and Records, 1920s Airpower:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-167"><span id="SPAN-168">1.5.1. Budget cutbacks
    reduced the 1918 Air Service from 190,000 men to fewer than 20,000. Likewise,
    the $460 million allocated for military aviation in 1919 fell to $25 million in
    1920. Even worse from a technology viewpoint, Congress demanded that new
    military aircraft use the surplus Liberty engines produced during the World War
    I buildup. Consequently, First World War vintage Curtiss Jennies and Liberty
    DH-4 bombers remained in service until the 1930s, despite technological
    advances in airframe and engine design.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-169"><span id="SPAN-170">1.5.2. As far back as
    1919, while Congress debated the size of the postwar establishment, the Air
    Service mounted shows for all occasions. Scarcely a county fair or patriotic
    gathering within flying distance of a military airfield operated without an
    aerial demonstration. Enlisted mechanics might lecture on how to repair the
    Liberty engine, while pilots flew acrobatics overhead. The traveling air shows,
    known as circuses, coincided with Victory Loan rallies and in later years
    provided entertainment at Armistice Day or Washington's Birthday celebrations.
    Enlisted pilots also took part in air shows, including a trio of intrepid
    flying sergeants who in 1923 put together an act that involved flying a tight
     V  formation while their planes were tied together with cords. Other enlisted
    pilots offered more routine skills, such as dropping demonstration smoke bombs.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-171"><span id="SPAN-172"><img width="163" height="211" src="afh1_files/image010.png" id="IMG-173"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-174"><span id="SPAN-175">1.5.3. A concerted
    effort to achieve records in speed, altitude, endurance, and other areas helped
    spur aviation advances in the 1920s. In September 1922, Lieutenant James
     Jimmy  Doolittle became the first man to fly across the United States in less
    than a day. Seven months later, Lieutenants Oakley Kelley and John Macready
    flew a Fokker T-2 on the first nonstop transcontinental flight. On 6 April
    1924, a team of Army pilots departed Seattle in four Douglas World Cruisers,
    christened the&nbsp;<i id="I-176">Chicago</i>,&nbsp;<i id="I-177">Boston</i>,&nbsp;<i id="I-178">Seattle</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i id="I-179">New Orleans</i>, in an effort to fly around the world. Although
    the&nbsp;<i id="I-180">Seattle</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i id="I-181">Boston</i>&nbsp;were lost to a
    mountain crash and engine failure, respectively, the remaining aircraft
    completed the circuit 175 days later. In 1925, Jimmy Doolittle achieved further
    fame by winning the Schneider Trophy, an over water seaplane race, and
    established a world seaplane record at 245.71 miles per hour. Although less
    publicized, Doolittle also played a major role in designing and testing instruments
    for all weather flying, including an altimeter, gyro, artificial horizon, and
    radio navigation aids. On 24 September 1929, Doolittle was the first pilot to
    take off, fly a set course, and land using instruments alone.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-182"><span id="SPAN-183">1.5.4. Air activities
    through the mid-1920s were relatively limited and generally focused on
    establishing records, testing equipment, and garnering headlines. Master
    electrician Jack Harding and Sergeant First Class Jerry Dobias served aboard a
    Martin bomber that flew  around the rim  of the country, starting at Bolling
    Field on 24 July 1919. Totaling 100 flights and 9,823 miles, Dobias kept the
    effort from ending almost before it began. Almost immediately after taking off
    from Bolling, he crawled out on the aircraft's left wing, without a parachute,
    to repair a leaky engine. In 1920, the Air Corps flew a round-trip flight of
    four DH-4Bs from Mitchell Field on Long Island to Nome, Alaska. The flight took
    three months and covered 9,000 miles and the safety record was largely
    attributable to Master Sergeant Albert Vierra.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-184"><span id="SPAN-185"><img width="195" height="144" src="afh1_files/image011.png" id="IMG-186"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-187"><span id="SPAN-188">1.5.5. Toward the end of
    the decade, Airmen were ready to demonstrate even more impressive records. New
    Year's Day 1929, a team of Airmen destined for fame took off in a Fokker C-2
    featuring a large question mark on the fuselage. The question was simple: how
    long could they stay in the air? Using a crude air refueling technique
    pioneered in 1923, Major Carl  Tooey  Spaatz, Capt Ira Eaker, Lieutenant Harry
    Halverson, Lieutenant Elwood  Pete  Quesada, and Staff Sergeant Roy Hooe flew
    the&nbsp;<i id="I-189">Question Mark</i>&nbsp;150 hours and 40 minutes, taking on 5,600
    gallons of hand-pumped fuel during 37 air-to air refuelings, to travel 11,000
    miles. This endurance test proved the unlimited range available with air
    refueling. The quest for world records in the 1920s honed the skills of Airmen,
    advanced aviation technology, and kept military aviation in the limelight.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-190"><span id="SPAN-191">1.5.6. An important
    group of demonstrations during the 1920s was more closely related to the
    airplane as an advanced weapon of war. As early as the beginning of the decade,
    Brigadier General Mitchell was convinced of airpower's potential as the primary
    component of national defense and a war-winning weapon and aggressively
    promoted his cause to create an independent Air Force. Hoping to make this the
    nation's first line of defense, he challenged the United States Navy, arguing
    that bombers rendered battleships obsolete. Reluctantly, the Navy agreed to
    allow Mitchell to test his Martin MB-2 bombers against some captured German
    ships. Mitchell's Airmen sank the 27,000-ton battleship,&nbsp;<i id="I-192">Ostfriesland</i>&nbsp;on
    21 July 1921. Despite the four-layer armored hull and watertight compartments,
    the battleship eventually disappeared into the water. Although Mitchell failed
    to convince the War or Navy departments, the bombing tests spurred
    carrier-based aviation development.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p align="center" id="P-193"><span id="SPAN-194"><img width="155" height="161" src="afh1_files/image012.png" id="IMG-195"></span></p>

    <p id="P-200"><span id="SPAN-201">1.5.7. Despite previous
    air service successes, the Navy remained unconvinced about their vulnerability
    from the air. Officials eventually turned over two World War I battleships, the
    USS&nbsp;<i id="I-202">New Jersey</i>&nbsp;(BB-16) and the USS<i id="I-203">&nbsp;Virginia,</i>&nbsp;for
    further testing. A young bombardier, Sergeant Ulysses  Sam  Nero, earned a slot
    among the 12 aircrews selected by General Mitchell to try to sink the
    battleships.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-204"><span id="SPAN-205"><img width="132" height="220" src="afh1_files/image013.png" id="IMG-206"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-207"><span id="SPAN-208">1.5.8. On 5 September
    1923, 11 aircraft reached the targets just off the North Carolina coast the
    12th returned to base because of engine trouble. Ten of the aircraft dropped
    their ordnance far from the&nbsp;<i id="I-209">New Jersey.</i>&nbsp;Nero, using different
    tactics than General Mitchell instructed, scored two hits. General Mitchell
    disqualified Nero and his pilot from further competition but reconsidered when
    the remainder of the crews failed to hit the&nbsp;<i id="I-210">Virginia&nbsp;</i>until
    they dropped down to 1,500 feet.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-211"><span id="SPAN-212">1.5.9.
    Nero and the Martin-Curtiss NBS-1 pilot approached the&nbsp;<i id="I-213">New Jersey</i>&nbsp;at
    85 miles per hour at an altitude of 6,900 feet, from about 15 degrees off the
    port beam. Using an open wire site, Nero dropped his first 600-pound bomb right
    down the ship's smokestack. A delayed explosion lent suspense to the result,
    but a billowing black cloud signaled the&nbsp;<i id="I-214">New Jersey s</i>&nbsp;demise,
    which went down in just over three minutes. Having one bomb left and no&nbsp;<i id="I-215">New
    Jersey</i>&nbsp;to drop it on, Nero's aircraft proceeded to the
    floundering&nbsp;<i id="I-216">Virginia,</i>&nbsp;where Nero proceeded to administer
    the&nbsp;<i id="I-217">coup de grace&nbsp;</i>on the stricken craft his bomb landed
    directly on the&nbsp;<i id="I-218">Virginia s</i>&nbsp;deck. General Mitchell promoted
    Nero during the next cycle.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-219"><span id="SPAN-220">1.5.10. Frustrated by
    what he perceived as a lack of progress, Mitchell's public statements were increasingly
    incendiary. When the Navy airship&nbsp;<i id="I-221">Shenandoah</i>&nbsp;crashed on 5
    September 1925, Mitchell issued a press release charging the Department of the
    Navy and the War Department with  incompetency, criminal negligence, and almost
    treasonable administration of our national defense.  During the ensuing court
    martial, Mitchell attempted to transform the trial into a public hearing on
    airpower. Found guilty of  conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the
    military service,  the court sentenced Mitchell to a five-year suspension from
    the service without pay. On 1 February 1926, Mitchell resigned from the Air
    Service to continue the fight for an independent air force. Until his death in
    1936, Mitchell fought tenaciously for his vision. He placed his indelible stamp
    on United States air combat practice and doctrine with his emphasis on massed
    forces and offensive operations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-222"><span id="SPAN-223">1.5.11. Mitchell s
    efforts produced some success for the fledgling Air Corps. The Air Corps Act of
    1926 greatly improved the status of aviation within the Army. This transformed
    the Air Service into the Air Corps, provided representation on the General
    Staff, added an Assistant Secretary of War for Air, and promised expansion to a
    force of 1,650 officers, 15,000 enlisted men, and 1,800 serviceable aircraft
    within five years. However, funding never matched the goal established.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-224"><b id="B-225"><span id="SPAN-226">1.6. Air Corps Tactical School and the Rise of
    the Bomber (1930s Air Corps):</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-227"><span id="SPAN-228">1.6.1. Although
    technological advances continued into the 1930s, the Great Depression dominated
    the decade. The technological promise of all-metal construction, monoplane
    design, and advanced power plants met the harsh realities of a shoe-string
    budget caused by reduced tax revenues and economic malaise. Toward the latter
    half of the decade, powerful totalitarian states, including Fascist Italy, Nazi
    Germany, Nationalist Japan, and the Communist Union of Soviet Socialist
    Republics, threatened western democracies, but powerful isolationist sentiment
    limited the United States military response.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-229"><span id="SPAN-230">1.6.2. Within the Air
    Corps, leading Airmen emphasized doctrinal development through the Air Corps
    Tactical School. Doctrine, the concepts that are the basis of how to fight,
    provided ideas for technological requirements, aircraft procurement, strategy,
    and tactics. The Air Corps Tactical School served as the military aviation
    doctrine center from their founding in 1920 as the Air Service Field Officer
    School, Langley Field, Virginia. In 1922, the school was renamed the Air
    Service Tactical School before becoming the Air Corps Tactical School in 1926.
    Even before the Air Corps Tactical School moved to Maxwell Field, Alabama, in
    1931, the school attracted the best and brightest Airmen to their faculty,
    including Harold L. George, Kenneth Walker, Donald Wilson, George C. Kenney,
    Haywood S. Hansell, and Muir S. Fairchild. Influenced by Billy Mitchell,
    Italy's Giulio Douhet, and Britain's Hugh Trenchard, the Air Corps Tactical
    School faculty emphasized long-range strategic bombardment.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-231"><span id="SPAN-232">1.6.3. According to Air
    Corps Tactical School lectures, massed bombers would penetrate enemy defenses,
    bypass field armies and navies, and strike enemy  vital centers' whose
    destruction would collapse the enemy's economy. Proper target selection would
    destroy an enemy's capability and will to fight. In an era before radar,
    airpower theorists believed effective air defense would be impossible. They
    looked to high altitude, speed, and internal armament for defense. These ideas
    ultimately led United States Airmen to emphasize the high altitude precision
    daylight bombardment that characterized much of the air operations during the
    Second World War.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-233"><span id="SPAN-234">1.6.4. During the
    interwar period, aircraft mechanics received formal technical training at
    Chanute Field, Illinois, at what became the Air Corps Technical School in 1926.
    Perhaps the key to the success of the technical school was the air service
    system of trade testing. While other branches of the Army returned to the
    apprentice system of assignment and training, the Army Air Corps continued to
    use and develop a combination of the Army Alpha Test, aptitude tests, and
    counseling. Enlisted men who wanted to apply for technical training had to
    qualify as high school graduates or the equivalent and pass a mathematics
    proficiency test in addition to the alpha test. Finally, a trade test
    specialist familiar with the actual work personally interviewed each enlisted
    man.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-235"><span id="SPAN-236">1.6.5. Classes at the
    technical school started in the fall and usually continued until the following
    spring. Students had to pay their own transportation to Illinois and, during
    some periods, lived in relatively crude conditions. Still, the training grew in
    popularity, and by 1938; the technical school had outgrown Chanute, with new
    branches opening at Lowry Field near Denver, Colorado, and at Scott Field in
    downstate Illinois.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-237"><span id="SPAN-238">1.6.6. Enlisted men
    participated in a range of experimental work, including altitude flights, blind
    flying, aerial photography, and cosmic ray research and the development of the
    parachute. Whether they were selected as guinea pigs or because they were just
    interested, enlisted men served as the first to try out new parachute designs,
    and they eventually took over most of the testing and training. The most
    prominent enlisted parachutist was Sergeant Ralph Bottriell who tested the
    first backpack-style, freefall parachute on 19 May 1919. Bottriell eventually
    became chief parachute instructor at Kelly Field, Texas, and earned the
    Distinguished Flying Cross in 1933 for service as an experimental parachute
    tester.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-250"><span id="SPAN-251">1.6.7. Coinciding with
    Air Corps Tactical School doctrine, the American aviation industry introduced a
    series of advanced bombers that encouraged airpower advocates. In 1931, the
    Boeing Airplane Company introduced the B-9, an all-metal, stressed-skin bomber
    with retractable landing gear capable of 188 mph. A few months later, the
    Martin B-10 overshadowed the open-cockpit B-9. The B-10 also featured an all
    metal, monoplane design with retractable landing gear, enclosed cockpit, a
    glazed gun turret, variable pitch propellers, wing flaps, and an internal bomb
    bay with power-driven doors. On 19 July 1934, Colonel Henry H.  Hap  Arnold led
    a squadron of B-10s from Washington, District of Columbia, to Anchorage,
    Alaska, covering 4,000 miles in 25 flying hours. Bomber theorists saw this
    exploit as a validation of their ideas.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-252"><span id="SPAN-253">1.6.8. In February 1934,
    a crisis arose that tested both the leadership and the flying skills of the Air
    Corps when President Franklin D. Roosevelt cancelled airmail contracts with
    civilian airlines. Without a thorough analysis of Air Corps capabilities,
    General Foulois asserted that the Air Corps would pick up the slack until
    contracts were renewed. However, the Air Corps underestimated the challenge
    posed. Army Airmen attempted to fly mail routes in open-cockpit planes with
    primitive instruments in one of the worst winters recorded. In three months,
    the Air Corps lost 66 aircraft and suffered 18 fatalities. The airmail fiasco
    forced Foulois to resign and led to a Congressional investigation known as the
    Baker Board.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-254"><span id="SPAN-255">1.6.9. The Baker Board
    scrutinized Air Corps operations and recommended the creation of a single
    command for all combat aircraft, known as General Headquarters Air Force. Brig
    Gen Frank Andrews assumed command 1 March 1935. Airmen applauded the action as
    a means to consolidate command, centralize doctrine, and integrate training.
    The initial cadre included 17 combat units: three wings, ten groups, and four
    squadrons. Today's Air Combat Command traces their heritage to General
    Headquarters Air Force. Among other measures, the General Headquarters Air
    Force called for a bomber capable of carrying a 2,000-pound payload for 1,020
    miles, at a speed of 200 mph. The Martin and Douglas companies advanced
    designs, but the Boeing's Model 299 was what excited the General Headquarters
    Air Force staff. In August 1935, the four-engine aircraft flew 2,100 miles
    nonstop from Seattle, Washington, to Dayton, Ohio, averaging 232 mph. The B-17
     Flying Fortress,  paired with the Norden bombsight, revolutionized bombardment
    and promised to validate Air Corps Tactical School theories. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-277"><span id="SPAN-278">1.7.1. The resulting
    reorganization established a General Headquarters Air Force (a measure that set
    up a tactical air force under the direct control of the Army General
    Headquarters but left the day-to-day organization of the Air Corps mostly
    intact a confusing half-step toward an independent air force) and recognized
    that technological advances in aircraft would eventually make air power a
    significant military force apart from its early role of solely supporting
    ground troops. The appearance of the B-17 bomber and the threat of global war
    ushered in an era of greater expenditure, manpower expansion, and more
    specialized and more sophisticated training.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-279"><span id="SPAN-280">1.7.2. The General
    Headquarters Air Force resumed the practice of sending demonstration teams to
    fairs and expositions and expanded the scope and scale of publicity flights to
    include large gestures such as goodwill missions to South America. These
    expeditions also provided opportunities to test the new long-range big bombers.
    In February 1938, the air force flew six B-17s with full crews, including
    enlisted men, to Buenos Aires to mark the inauguration of the new Argentine
    president.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-281"><span id="SPAN-282">1.7.3 Even before the
    actual outbreak of hostilities in Europe in the fall of 1939, the General
    Headquarters Air Force had begun the massive expansion program that would
    blossom during the following years into the largest air organization in the
    Nation's history. In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt asked for an
    appropriation of $300 million for military aviation. The Air Corps planned for
    24 operational combat-ready groups by 1941, which called for greatly enhanced
    manpower, training, and equipment.</span></p>

    <p id="P-286"><span id="SPAN-287">In 1938, when the United States first took
    seriously the signs of war in Europe, the army's air arm was still split into
    two cumbersome command organizations, the Army Air Corps and General
    Headquarters Air Force. The total force included less than 20,000 enlisted
    Airmen. In 1940, Congress passed the first peacetime conscription law in United
    States history. By March 1944 when the air force manpower reached their high
    point, 2,104,405 enlisted men and women were serving in a virtually independent
    branch of the armed services. Moreover, they operated a sophisticated machine
    of air war that covered nearly the entire globe.</span></p>

    <p id="P-291"><span id="SPAN-292">1.9.1. If the First
    World War signaled airpower's promise, the Second World War fulfilled the
    vision. In every aspect of aerial combat, airpower served as a force multiplier
    and a vital component of the joint, combined arms campaign. Air superiority
    proved a prerequisite for successful land, sea, or air operations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-293"><span id="SPAN-294">1.9.2. On 1 September
    1939, Adolf Hitler launched a massive assault on Poland that opened the
    greatest war in history and spawned the term Blitzkrieg, or  lightning war. 
    The German Air Force (<i id="I-295">Luftwaffe</i>) employed Messerschmitt Me109 fighters
    to gain air superiority; Heinkel He-111 and Dornier Do-17 twin-engined bombers
    to pound Poland's capital, Warsaw; and Junkers Ju-87&nbsp;<i id="I-296">Stuka</i>&nbsp;dive
    bombers to attack Polish ground forces and terrorize refugees. Commanded by
    Hermann G ring, the&nbsp;<i id="I-297">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;emphasized speed and
    concentration of forces to crush the enemy.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-298"><span id="SPAN-299">1.9.3. In April 1940,
    German forces surprised neutral Denmark and Norway, where&nbsp;<i id="I-300">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;aircraft
    inflicted significant damage to Britain's Royal Navy, protected inferior German
    naval forces, and airlifted German troops to Norwegian airfields. In May,
    Hitler's forces invaded the Netherlands and Belgium. The speed of the German
    advance and the ruthlessness of the bombing of Rotterdam shocked the West.
    German paratroopers and glider forces surprised Belgium's famed Eban Emael
    fortress, considered the strongest in Europe. When German forces attacked
    France, the&nbsp;<i id="I-301">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;gained air superiority, masked the
    movement of German panzers through the Ardennes forest, and hindered Allied
    attempts to rally.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-302"><span id="SPAN-303">1.9.4. Following the
    defeat of France in June 1940, the victorious&nbsp;<i id="I-304">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;faced
    Britain's Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain, the first all-air campaign
    in history. On paper, the&nbsp;<i id="I-305">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;appeared to have a
    decisive edge, with 1,232 medium bombers, 406 dive bombers, 813 single-engine
    fighters, 282 twin-engine fighters, and 50 long-range reconnaissance aircraft
    manned by experienced crews. Opposing them, Air Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding s
    Fighter Command assembled 704 operational aircraft, including roughly 400
    Hawker Hurricanes, suited for attacking bombers, and 200 Supermarine Spitfires,
    a fighter equal to German Messerschmitts.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-306"><span id="SPAN-307">1.9.5. Despite the
    apparent mismatch, the German Air Force suffered from serious weaknesses.
    Substantial losses had eroded&nbsp;<i id="I-308">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;strength; in
    particular, the forces in France badly needed rest and refitting. Equally
    significant, German training, equipment, and experience proved ill-suited for a
    long-range strategic air campaign. Although the Me-109 was a superb fighter,
    the short range limited the Me-109 combat time and tactical flexibility over
    England. The long-range Me-110 proved hopelessly outclassed by Royal Air Force
    Spitfires and Hurricanes. On the other hand, Dowding's Fighter Command had been
    preparing for a German onslaught since 1937. Using Sir Robert Watson-Watt s
    innovation, radar, the British created an effective, integrated air defense system.
    Dowding also exploited a breakthrough in code breaking with the use of the
    Enigma machine. Any information gained from Enigma was top secret and known as
    ULTRA. This gave British intelligence forewarning of major attacks and
    invaluable insight on the status of German maintenance and logistics.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-309"><span id="SPAN-310">1.9.6. Plagued by poor
    intelligence, G ring and other&nbsp;<i id="I-311">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;leaders
    miscalculated, leading to a battle of attrition won by the Royal Air Force.
    Failing to appreciate the value of British radar stations, the Germans first
    attacked Royal Air Force airfields and then after the Royal Air Force bombed
    Berlin 24 August,</span><span id="SPAN-312">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-313">switched to a terror bombing campaign against
    London. Against German losses of 1,733 aircraft, the Royal Air Force lost 915
    planes. By 15 September 1940, Hitler abandoned his planned invasion of Britain.
    In tribute to the Royal Air Force Fighter Command, Prime Minister Winston
    Churchill stated,  Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so
    many to so few. </span></p>

    <p id="P-317"><span id="SPAN-318">1.9.7. The fall of France
    in June 1940 galvanized President Franklin Roosevelt's resolve to fight Nazi
    tyranny. Knowing the isolationist sentiment of many Americans, Roosevelt turned
    to airpower as a major weapon. The President called for American industry to
    build 50,000 military aircraft. Considering that in 1939, the United States
    Army Air Corps numbered roughly 1,800 aircraft and 18,000 men, this figure
    stunned air leaders and industrialists alike. American industry proved equal to
    the task, but aeronautical designs, blueprints, tools, dies, air frames, and
    engines, not to mention factories, skilled workers, and the countless other
    components of an aviation industry required time to develop. Air logisticians
    such as Major General Oliver P. Echols began the most massive aircraft
    procurement program in history. Until December 1940, the United States built
    aircraft at a rate of only 800 per month. By 1942, American factories produced
    47,800 aircraft, and by 1944, an astronomical 96,300 planes. American
    industrial production emerged as a key to Allied victory.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-319"><span id="SPAN-320">1.9.8. To manage growing
    American airpower, a major reorganization created the United States Army Air
    Forces. General Henry  Hap  Arnold was appointed Commanding General of the
    United States Army Air Forces and Deputy Chief of Staff, Air Force to General
    George C. Marshall. In August 1941, a group of ex-Air Corps Tactical School
    instructors created a doctrinal blueprint, Air War Planning Document 1, for the
    conduct of a strategic air campaign against the Axis. Led by Lieutenant Colonel
    Harold  Hal  George, Major Lawrence Kuter, Major Kenneth Walker, and Captain
    Haywood  Possum  Hansell, the team created the conceptual framework for the
    American air effort in World War II. Reflecting 1930s Air Corps Tactical School
    doctrine of using massive force to destroy the enemy's will and capability to
    fight through long-range strategic bombardment, Air War Planning Document 1
    called for 239 combat groups; 26,416 combat aircraft, including 7,500 heavy
    bombers; 37,051 training planes; 150,000 trained aircrews; and 2.2 million
    personnel.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-321"><span id="SPAN-322">1.9.9. On 7 December
    1941,  a date which will live in infamy,  Imperial Japan dealt a devastating
    blow to the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Two waves of 350
    Japanese aircraft sank or heavily damaged all eight United States battleships.
    Concerned over the prospect of sabotage, the United States Army ground
    commander ordered United States Army Air Forces aircraft parked in tight rows
    that made prime targets for Japanese aviators. To make matters worse, a few
    hours later, Japanese forces caught United States aircraft on the ground
    refueling in the Philippines and destroyed&nbsp; B-17s and assorted fighters.
    On 8 December, the United States declared war on Japan; three days later,
    Germany and Italy were at war with the United States as allies of Japan.
    Despite the fact the attack on Pearl Harbor was what formally brought the
    United States into the war, the war in Europe and the defeat of Germany would
    take precedence.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-323"><span id="SPAN-324">1.9.10. As America
    entered the war, the Royal Air Force tried to persuade the United States Army
    Air Forces to switch to night operations, like those of Royal Air Force Bomber
    Command. Under Air Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, Royal Air Force bombing doctrine
    embraced night area bombing of German cities to displace German workers. To
    United States Army Air Forces leaders, night bombing was ineffective,
    inefficient, and indiscriminate with regard to civilian casualties. After tough
    negotiations, the Casablanca Directive of January 1943 inaugurated the Combined
    Bomber Offensive, codenamed Operation POINTBLANK, combining American precision
    daylight bombing and British night area bombing.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-325"><span id="SPAN-326">1.9.11. In February
    1942, Brig Gen Ira C. Eaker established the VIII Bomber Command, flying from
    bases in England in preparation for the United States Army Air Forces buildup.
    General Spaatz assumed command of the  Mighty Eighth  in June 1942. On 17
    August 1942, a dozen B-17Es from the 97th Bomb Group conducted the first
    American operational bombing mission. The strike against a railroad marshalling
    yard in Rouen, France, barely penetrated the German defenses, but the mission
    and a series of others known as the  Freshman Raids' showed promise for
    American daylight bombardment.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-327"><span id="SPAN-328"><img width="320" height="197" src="afh1_files/image018.png" id="IMG-329"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-330"><span id="SPAN-331">1.9.12. Three disastrous
    missions in the late summer and fall of 1943 illustrated United States Army Air
    Forces theory flaws. Eager to strike Hitler's oil supply, 177 B-24 Liberators
    based in North Africa attacked oil refineries at Ploesti, Romania, on 1 August
    1943. Ploesti was one of the most heavily defended targets in Europe, so
    success depended on a 2,700-mile flight (much at low-level to avoid radar
    detection), accurate open-water navigation, good weather, and surprise. But a
    combination of bad weather, human error, and bad luck scattered the bomber
    formations and resulted in a nightmare for surviving crews. As the careful plan
    imploded, bombers improvised striking targets of opportunity in the face of
    determined fighter opposition and hundreds of anti-aircraft guns. The attacking
    force lost 54 B-24s; 41 in combat. Of the 177 aircraft, only 30 emerged
    unscathed. Although the strike reduced oil-refining capacity by 40 percent,
    within a few days a new facility opened, negating the damage.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-332"><span id="SPAN-333">1.9.13. After finally
    assembling enough trained crews to strike deep into Germany, Eighth Air Force
    planners targeted German ball bearing factories in an effort to destroy a
     vital center  in the enemy's industrial web. They devised an ambitious double
    raid upon the Messerschmitt aircraft factory at Regensburg and the top-priority
    Schweinfurt ball bearing plants. The plan called for a wave of the 3d Air
    Division to fight through German fighters, hit Regensburg, and proceed to North
    Africa to land, followed 30 minutes later by a second bomber wave that would
    strike Schweinfurt as German fighters on the ground rearmed and refueled.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-334"><span id="SPAN-335">1.9.14. On 17 August
    1943, General LeMay's 3d Air Division launched the first wave. Thick fog
    delayed the second wave and prevented fighter escorts from taking off. When the
    fog lifted, almost the entire German fighter force pounced upon the ill-fated
    1st Air Division. The Eighth Air Force staggered under the loss of 60 out of
    361 B-17s and 600 trained aircrew members, more casualties in a day than during
    the previous six months. To make matters worse, the Schweinfurt ball bearing
    plants required reattack.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-336"><span id="SPAN-337">1.9.15. Known as  Black
    Thursday,  the 14 October 1943 mission against Schweinfurt effectively ended
    the United States Army Air Forces unescorted bombing campaign. Determined to
    destroy the top priority target, General Eaker ordered 291 B-17s to run the
    gauntlet of German fighters. This time, bombing accuracy improved significantly
    and the mission severely damaged the factories, but another 60 bombers were
    shot down; seven were destroyed upon landing in England, and 138 B-17s suffered
    battle damage.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-338"><span id="SPAN-339">1.9.16. While
    warplanners devoted the bulk of American airpower to daylight strategic
    bombing, in October 1943, heavily modified, mission-unique bombers from the
    Special Flight Section, 5th Bombardment Wing, Twelfth Air Force, along with
    England-based 801st Bombardment Group  Carpetbaggers,  provided clandestine
    support for allied partisans and guerilla units in occupied territories,
    rescuing hundreds of downed aircrews trapped behind enemy lines.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-340"><span id="SPAN-341">1.9.17. Some
    technological and production breakthroughs reversed the course of the air war
    over the winter of 19431944. During the initial campaigns, effective long-range
    escort fighters appeared to be technically impossible. In order to carry the
    fuel necessary for long-range flight, fighters required at least twin engines,
    but the increased size sacrificed speed and maneuverability. The long-range
    Lockheed P-38 Lightning offered a partial solution, but the P-38's performance
    lagged at high altitudes. In mid-1943, the United States Army Air Forces
    introduced 75-gallon, and later 108-gallon, drop tanks that extended the combat
    radius of the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter from 175 miles to 280 miles and
    325 miles, respectively. The P-47's extended range proved an important step,
    but only a partial answer to the escort problem.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-342"><span id="SPAN-343">1.9.18. The North
    American Aviation P-51 Mustang revolutionized the air war over Europe. Designed
    in only 100 days during the spring of 1940, the Mustang was to supplement the
    Royal Air Force's Spitfire. The initial Allison engine for the P-51 proved
    inadequate; but when the Spitfire's Rolls-Royce Merlin engine replaced the
    original power plant, the results stunned aviators. At 440 mph, the P-51B was
    faster and could out turn and out dive the latest models of Me-109 and the new
    Focke-Wulf FW-190. With a basic range of 500 miles, augmentable to 850 miles,
    the Mustang flew farther than a B-17 with normal payload. Introduced in
    December 1943, the P-51 had to wait until late February 1944 before weather
    permitted full flight operations and was a technological marvel: a plane with a
    bomber's range and a fighter's performance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-344"><span id="SPAN-345">1.9.19. The P-47 and
    P-51 team seized the air superiority from the<i id="I-346">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;in the
    spring of 1944. Complementing the technological improvements, Allied factories
    poured out large numbers of new aircraft and stateside training bases produced
    well-trained air crews. At the helm of the VIII Fighter Command, Brigadier
    General William E. Kepner maximized his advantage by introducing new tactics.
    Fighters would no longer be required to  stick to the bombers.  Numerical
    superiority permitted fighter sweeps and aggressive scouting; superior range
    allowed fighters to strafe German airfields and attack targets of opportunity.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-347"><span id="SPAN-348">1.9.20. Armed with new
    aircraft, tactics, and superior numbers, Spaatz, Doolittle, and Kepner launched
    Operation ARGUMENT with the objective of winning air superiority and crippling
    Germany's aircraft industry. Between 20 and 25 February 1944, the 8th Air Force
    flew 3,300 heavy bomber sorties; the Fifteenth Air Force added 500 missions
    from Italy; and Royal Air Force Bomber Command flew 2,750 night attacks aimed
    at German aircraft manufacturing plants. Protecting them involved nearly 4,000
    fighter sorties. At a cost of 226 American bombers, 114 British heavies, and 41
    United States Army Air Forces fighters, Operation ARGUMENT destroyed 355&nbsp;<i id="I-349">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;fighters,
    damaged 155 fighters, and killed 400 fighter pilots. Although the&nbsp;<i id="I-350">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;replaced
    its aircraft, it could not replace the 2,262 experienced pilots killed in the
    five months preceding D-Day, the invasion of Normandy.</span></p>

    <p id="P-357"><span id="SPAN-358">1.9.21. By 6 June 1944,
    Allied air forces dominated the skies of Europe. On the first day of the
    invasion, the Allies directed 8,722 United States Army Air Forces and 5,676
    Royal Air Force sorties against German defenses in France. In response, the
    once vaunted&nbsp;<i id="I-359">Luftwaffe</i>&nbsp;could launch fewer than 100 sorties and
    only two German aircraft inflicted damage on the invasion beaches. Allied
    bombers and fighters trumped the German integrated air defense network.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-360"><span id="SPAN-361">1.9.22. After the
    Normandy invasion, the Combined Bomber Offensive devastated Germany.
    Approximately 75 percent of the 1.5 million tons of bombs dropped were after
    June 1944. In contrast to the horrific losses experienced at Schweinfurt,
    Regensburg, and Ploesti in 1943, American losses fell to  acceptable  rates. By
    1945, some raids reported negligible losses: one bomber lost out of 1,094 sent
    to Kassel, five out of 1,310 at ChemnitzMagdeburg, and zero losses out of 1,219
    at Nuremburg. At its peak, the United States Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force
    massed 7,904 heavy bombers in the theater and 28,000 combat planes total. By 16
    April 1945, General Spaatz declared the strategic air war against Germany ended
    since all significant targets were considered destroyed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-362"><span id="SPAN-363">1.9.23. From 1942 to
    1945, the Combined Bomber Offensive was the longest, bloodiest, air campaign in
    history. According to the United States Strategic Bombing Survey, the Allies
    flew 1.69 million combat sorties and dropped 1.5 million tons of bombs, killing
    and wounding more than a million Germans, and destroying 3.6 million buildings:
    20 percent of the nation's total. Airpower emerged as a dominant weapon in
    Western Europe during World War II.</span></p>

    <p id="P-367"><span id="SPAN-368">1.9.24. Enlisted
    personnel served with honor throughout World War II. For example, a raid
    against the last operational Nazi oil refinery on 15 March 1945 was successful,
    but cost the life of one of the enlisted force's most decorated Airmen.
    Sergeant Sandy Sanchez flew 44 missions as a gunner with the 95th Bomb Group,
    19 more than required to complete his tour. After returning home for a brief
    period, rather than accept an assignment as a gunnery instructor, he returned
    to Europe. Flying with the 353d Bombardment Squadron in Italy, Sanchez s
    aircraft was hit by ground fire. Nine of the 10-member crew bailed out
    successfully, but Sanchez never made it from the stricken aircraft. Sanchez was
    the only enlisted airman to have a B-17 named for him.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-369"><span id="SPAN-370">1.9.25. At the age of
    20, on a mission to bomb the oil refineries outside Vienna, Technical Sergeant
    Paul Airey and his fellow crewmen were shot down on their 28th mission. He was
    held as a prisoner of war for 10 months, surviving a 90-day march from the
    Baltic Sea to Berlin before being liberated by the British Army in 1945.
    Promoted to Chief Master Sergeant in 1962, Airey became the first Chief Master

    President Franklin D. Roosevelt directed the Army Air Corps to accept black
    Americans into aviation cadet training. The Air Corps, like all other
    components of the United States Armed Forces, decided to segregate black
    aviators into all-black squadrons. By the end of World War II, nearly a
    thousand black Americans had earned their wings as Army flyers. Fired by a
    determination to prove their patriotism, valor, and skill in combat, these
    black aviators, forever called the Tuskegee Airmen, struck a significant blow
    against racism in America.</span></p>

    <p id="P-386"><span id="SPAN-387">1.10.2. The first
    Tuskegee Airmen to fight were members of the 99th Fighter Squadron, a unit
    commanded by black West Point graduate and future Air Force general officer,
    Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. On 27 January 1944, over Anzio, pilots from the
    99th Fighter Squadron, flying obsolete P-40s, downed nine superior Focke-Wulf
    190s. As the 99th Fighter Squadron continued scoring kills, the 332d Fighter
    Group, another unit manned by Tuskegee Airmen, arrived in Italy with obsolete
    P-39 ground-attack fighters. In the spring of 1944, these segregated units
    transitioned to P-47 Thunderbolts and to P-51 Mustangs a month later, when they
    began flying bomber escort missions.</span></p>

    the German surrender in the spring of 1945. By a large margin, the Tuskegee
    Airmen destroyed more aircraft than they lost. They shot down 111 enemy
    aircraft in air-to-air combat, losing 66 of their own aircraft to all causes,
    including seven shot down. A tribute to their skill, courage, and
    determination, the Tuskegee Airmen amassed a distinguished combat record on 200
    escort missions into Germany.&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-392">&nbsp;</span></p>

    ability to prepare for war was hampered by frequent relocations and
    segregation-imposed training barriers.</span><span id="SPAN-395">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-396">Nevertheless, the Tuskegee

    record, they dispelled myths, opened eyes, rewrote history, and prepared the
    United States Air Force to be the first armed service to integrate racially.</span></p>

    <p id="P-411"><span id="SPAN-412">1.11.1.
    America's first combat experience in the Pacific Theater of World War II
    occurred before the declaration of war. In early 1941, former Air Corps
    Tactical School instructor Claire Lee Chennault organized the American
    volunteer group, known as the  Flying Tigers,  to aid Nationalist China against
    Japanese invaders. Famous for shark mouths painted on their Curtis P-40
    Warhawks, the Flying Tigers amassed an impressive 286 confirmed victories,
    losing only 12 pilots, before being disbanded in July 1942.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-413"><span id="SPAN-414">1.11.2. The Japanese
    forces appeared invincible during the first six months of conflict, and America
    needed a strong offensive strike against the Japanese to boost sagging morale.
    On 18 April 1942, Lieutenant Colonel James  Jimmy  Doolittle led 16 North
    American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers, launching from the carrier USS&nbsp;<i id="I-415">Hornet</i>,
    in a bombing raid on various targets in Tokyo, Kobe, and Nagoya. The Doolittle
    Raid inflicted little damage, but the gesture shocked Japanese military leaders
    and cheered the American public. Upon his return to the United States in May
    1942, Doolittle received the Medal of Honor and promotion to brigadier
    general.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-416"><span id="SPAN-417">1.11.3. Not many fliers
    have had a popular song written about them, but an exception was a soft-spoken
    United States Army Air Force enlisted man, John D. Foley. Although he never received
    aerial gunnery training, he volunteered as a gunner and was assigned to a B-26
    crew. On his first mission, Foley shot down at least one Japanese enemy
    aircraft. Other 19th Bomb Squadron members confirmed his victory and he was
    nicknamed  Johnny Zero  by a war correspondent. Corporal Foley became a hero
    and the subject of a popular song,  Johnny Got a Zero.  Commercial firms
    capitalized on his fame and produced such items as  Johnny Zero  watches and
    boots. During his 31 other Pacific combat missions, Foley shared in the
    destruction of at least six more enemy aircraft and survived three crashes.
    Malaria forced his return to the United States in 1943 where he toured
    factories promoting war production. He volunteered to fly again and completed
    31 missions over Europe. He returned to the United States again and was
    preparing for a third overseas tour when World War II ended. But before the war
    ended, Foley became an Army Air Force legend by being decorated a total of
    eight times for heroism including personal recognition by Generals MacArthur,
    Eisenhower, and Doolittle.<b id="B-418">&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-419"><span id="SPAN-420">1.11.4. Naval aviation
    played a vital role in the Pacific War. Under the leadership of Admirals
    Chester Nimitz, Frank  Jack  Fletcher, Raymond Spruance, and William  Bull 
    Halsey, United States carrier-based aviation proved the value of airpower at
    sea. The Battle of Coral Sea, fought 4-8 May 1942, marked the first naval
    battle fought entirely by air. At the Battle of Midway, 4 June 1942, United
    States Navy pilots sank four Japanese carriers and turned the tide of the war
    in the Pacific.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-421"><span id="SPAN-422">1.11.5. The primary
    United States Army Air Forces contribution to the Pacific counterattack was
    made by the Fifth Air Force, attached to the Southwest Pacific Theater under
    General Douglas MacArthur's command. While Admiral Nimitz  carrier task forces
    struck from the Central Pacific, MacArthur's command thrust across New Guinea
    toward the Philippines. Because of the  Europe First  strategy, Fifth Air Force
    flew second string aircraft out of primitive bases, struggling to overcome its
    low resource priority level and a 10,000 mile supply chain.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-423"><span id="SPAN-424">1.11.6. In July 1942,
    Major General George C. Kenney assumed command of the Fifth Air Force. Kenney
    maximized the resource-poor command's combat power. In a theater where range
    dominated employment decisions, Kenney used the Lockheed P-38 Lightning with
    locally developed 150-gallon drop tanks. Kenney encouraged an ingenious
    subordinate, Maj Paul  Pappy  Gunn, to mount quad .50-caliber machine guns in
    the nose of A-20 and B-25 aircraft, creating deadly attack planes. Other Fifth
    Air Force innovations included parachutes attached to fragmentation bombs and
    low-level  skip  bombing techniques.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-425"><span id="SPAN-426">1.11.7. An even lower a
    priority than Fifth Air Force, Allied forces in the China-Burma-India Theater
    faced logistical challenges at the end of the war's longest supply chain.
    Called to transport vital supplies across the Himalayas, Air Transport Command
    crews, flying C-46s and C-47s, braved perilous weather conditions to deliver
    650,000 tons of supplies to Chinese and American forces. Flying the  Hump  was
    one of the most hazardous military air operations of World War II. Enterprise
    architect William H. Tunner developed many maintenance and cargo-handling
    techniques that later proved invaluable during the Berlin Airlift.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-427"><span id="SPAN-428">1.11.8. In addition to
    Air Transport Command efforts in the China-Burma-India Theater, the 1st Air
    Commando Group, led by Lieutenant Colonel Phillip G. Cochran and John R.
    Allison, provided assistance to British  Chindit  forces conducting long-range
    penetration missions against the Japanese during Operation Thursday, using
    unconventional air warfare to support British ground forces. America's first
    Air Commandos demonstrated that air power could support unconventional warfare
    any place, any time. The 1st Air Commando Group also demonstrated its
    ingenuity, conducting the first helicopter combat rescue.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-429"><span id="SPAN-430"><img width="207" height="174" src="afh1_files/image026.png" id="IMG-431"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-432"><span id="SPAN-433">1.11.9. Allied soldiers,
    sailors, and marines pushed back the borders of the Japanese empire and airmen
    sought to destroy Japan through strategic bombardment. General Arnold hoped to
    clinch victory through airpower alone in order to avoid a costly land invasion.
    In November 1939, Air Corps leaders selected the primary campaign instrument:
    the Boeing XB-29. With a pressurized crew compartment, remotely controlled
    guns, and new radial engines, the B-29 was an aircraft of unprecedented size
    and capability. The United States Army Air Forces ordered 1,664 before the
    prototype had even flown. The rush to produce the plane led to substantial
    technical problems. Nevertheless, by April 1944, B-29s appeared in the
    China-Burma-India to conduct Operation MATTERHORN, the designation for B-29
    operations out of bases in India and China to carry out strategic bombing of
    Japanese force.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-434"><span id="SPAN-435">1.11.10. At first, XX
    Bomber Command crews attempted to reproduce high-altitude daylight precision
    bombing, with disappointing results. Flying from bases in China with logistical
    staging from India, XX Bomber Command engine problems were amplified by distance
    and weather. By October 1944, B-29 operations shifted to Saipan, significantly
    reducing supply lines. Former Air Corps Tactical School instructor Haywood S.
    Hansell renewed efforts for a daylight precision bombing campaign. Impatient
    with the results, General Arnold replaced Hansell in January 1945 with Major
    General Curtis E. LeMay, a proven combat commander from the European theater.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-436"><span id="SPAN-437">1.11.11. LeMay
    drastically altered B-29 tactics. To avoid the jet stream and high-altitude
    engine problems, LeMay ordered low-altitude night attacks with bombers stripped
    of defensive machine guns, reduced fuel loads, and increased bomb loads. Much
    like the Royal Air Force, LeMay's B-29s relied on darkness for protection and
    pummeled enemy cities with incendiary bombs. From March-August 1945, American
    firebomb raids destroyed 66 Japanese cities and burned 178 square miles of
    urban landscape. Civilian casualties were severe; in one raid against Tokyo an
    estimated 80,000 people perished.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-438"><span id="SPAN-439">1.11.12. Following a
    successful atomic test on 18 July 1945, the Allied powers issued an ultimatum
    on 26 July calling for the Japanese government to surrender or suffer  prompt
    and utter destruction.  Specially modified B-29s from the 393d Bombardment
    Squadron, a component of the 509th Composite Group, delivered the first
    operational atomic bombs. On 6 August 1945, Colonel Paul Tibbets piloted the
    Enola Gay which dropped a uranium bomb, known as</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-440"><span id="SPAN-441"> Little Boy,  over
    Hiroshima destroying nearly five square miles of the city and killing 80,000 people.
    Japan did not surrender. On 9 August 1945, the B-29 Bockscar, commanded by
    Major Charles W. Sweeney, released a plutonium bomb called  Fat Man  on
    Nagasaki. Because Nagasaki was partially protected by hilly terrain, the bomb
    devastated 1.5 square miles, killed 35,000, and injured 60,000. Faced with a
    defeated army, destroyed navy and air force, burned cities, a declaration of
    war by the Soviet Union, and atomic weapons, the Japanese government
    surrendered 14 August 1945. In the Pacific Theater, airpower proved even more
    decisive than in Europe. The industrial might of the United States overwhelmed
    Japanese forces. The geographic circumstances and immense distances involved
    made airpower the preeminent weapon.</span></p>

    <p id="P-454"><span id="SPAN-455">1.12.1. With victory in
    World War II, the American public returned to normal life. Airpower and
    military affairs, in general, decreased in importance. From a wartime strength
    of more than 79,000 aircraft and 2.4 million people, forces dwindled to 24,000
    aircraft and 304,000 people by May 1947. Nevertheless, airpower's impact on
    warfare led to the realization of Billy Mitchell's dream. On 26 July 1947,
    President Harry S. Truman signed into law the National Security Act of 1947,
    which provided for a separate Department of the Air Force. On 18 September
    1947, Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the Air Force and
    officially established the United States Air Force as an independent, coequal
    service. Under the leadership of General Spaatz as the first Chief of Staff,
    Air Force and that of his successor, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, the Air Force
    clarified roles and missions and organized to meet the challenges of the
    growing Cold War.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-456"><span id="SPAN-457">1.12.2. In many areas,
    the establishment of the Air Force had little impact on the lives of most
    Airmen until months or even years had passed. What were designated as  organic 
    service units were taken over as newly designated Air Force units. Units that
    provided a common service to both the Army and the Air Force were left intact.
    Until 1950, for example, if an Airman became seriously ill, he was likely
    treated by Army doctors in an Army hospital. There was also, at first, no
    change in appearance. The distinctive blue uniforms of the United States Air
    Force were introduced only after large stocks of Army clothing were used up.
    Familiar terms slowly gave way to new labels. By 1959, enlisted Airmen ate in
     dining halls' rather than  mess halls,  were eyed warily by  air police 
    instead of  military police,  and bought necessities at the  base exchange 
    instead of the  post exchange. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-458"><span id="SPAN-459">1.12.3.
    Initially, the enlisted rank system remained as it had been in the United
    States Army Air Force. Corporal was removed from NCO status in 1950. Then, in
    1952, the Air Force officially changed the names of the lower four ranks from
    private to Airman basic; private first class to Airman, third class; corporal
    to Airman, second class; and sergeant to Airman, first class. These changes
    were in response to a development that surfaced during World War II, and the
    rank structure would continue to evolve over time. Promotion and specialization
    went hand-in-hand with training in the new Air Force. When the new organization
    established Air Force specialty codes as standard designations for functional
    and technical specialties, qualification for an advanced Air Force specialty
    code became part of the criteria for promotion. During the late 1940s, the Air
    Force also began an Airman Career Program that attempted to encourage long term
    careers for enlisted specialists.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-460"><span id="SPAN-461">1.12.4. The Berlin
    Crisis awakened Americans to the impact of the Cold War between the United
    States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. On 24 June 1948, the
    Soviets blockaded railroad and road corridors serving the 2.5 million residents
    of West Berlin, deep within Communist East Germany. United States Air Forces in
    Europe Commander General LeMay organized a makeshift airlift of food, medicine,
    and coal. United States Air Forces in Europe C-47 and C-54 cargo aircraft
    established a precise schedule of flights every three minutes, 24-hours-a-day.
    After the first month, Major General William H. Tunner assumed command of an
    expanded effort that would include 300 American and 100 British aircraft flown
    by aircrews who would apply lessons learned while flying the  Hump  during
    World War II. On 15 April 1949, 1,398 aircraft delivered a one-day record
    12,941 tons of supplies. By 1949, the Soviets acknowledged the airlift s
    success and lifted the blockade. Operation VITTLES tallied 277,804 flights
    delivering 2.3 million tons of supplies. This nonviolent use of airpower<b id="B-462">&nbsp;</b>defused
    a potentially disastrous confrontation.</span></p>

    <p id="P-469"><span id="SPAN-470">1.12.5. Throughout the
    airlift, enlisted personnel served as cargo managers and loaders (with a major
    assist from German civilians), air traffic controllers, communications
    specialists, and weather and navigation specialists. Of all the enlisted
    functions, perhaps the most critical to the success of the airlift was
    maintenance. The Soviets' eventual capitulation and dismantling of the surface
    blockade represented one of the great Western victories of the cold war without
    a bomb having been dropped and laid the foundation for the North Atlantic
    Treaty Organization (NATO).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-471"><span id="SPAN-472">1.12.6. The 1948 Berlin
    Crisis and 1949 Soviet detonation of an atomic device motivated the Air Force
    to improve war readiness. As the new Strategic Air Command commander, General
    LeMay emphasized rigorous training, exacting performance standards, and
    immediate readiness. In the late 1940s, SAC incorporated the B-50 (a more
    powerful version of the B-29) and the massive Convair B-36 Peacemaker (the
    first bomber with intercontinental range) into the inventory. Behind the
    scenes, the Air Force conducted a highly secret, extensive electronic
    reconnaissance program that included covert flights over the Union of Soviet
    Socialist Republic to assess Communist air defenses.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-473"><span id="SPAN-474">1.12.7. Jet aircraft
    technological breakthroughs changed the face of aviation. Although the Bell
    XP-59 Airacomet first flew 1 October 1942, the Lockheed P-80 (later
    redesignated F-80) entered service in December 1945 as the Air Force's first
    operational jet fighter. On 14 October 1947, Charles  Chuck  Yeager seized
    headlines as the first man to break the sound barrier. His Bell X-1  Glamorous Glennis 
    reached Mach 1.06 at 43,000 feet after a launch from a B-29 mother ship. In the
    early 1950s, Strategic Air Command upgraded to an all-jet bomber force,
    activating the Boeing B-47 Stratojet and the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress.</span></p>

    On 25 June 1950, Communist North Korea launched a massive invasion of&nbsp;</span><b id="B-483"><span id="SPAN-484">X-1 and the B-29</span></b><b id="B-485"><span id="SPAN-486">&nbsp;</span></b><span id="SPAN-487">United States-backed South Korea. Three days later, American B-26
    bombers attacked advancing North Korean troops in the first major flare-up of
    the Cold War. For six weeks, Far East Air Forces, commanded by Lieutenant
    General George E. Stratemeyer, gained air superiority to help United Nations
    forces shut down the North Korean assault. The initial phase of the Korean War
    illustrated the dangers of being unprepared, as American Airmen struggled to
    relearn close air support and interdiction skills. In addition, the F-80 s
    limited range inhibited the time over target required for tactical operations.
    About 100 Far East Air Forces Bomber Command B-29s conducted strategic
    operations to destroy the enemy's will and capacity to fight. Although United
    Nations forces controlled the skies and destroyed North Korea's industrial
    base, multiple limitations frustrated hopes of decisive victory.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-488"><span id="SPAN-489">1.12.9. General
    MacArthur's amphibious assault at Inchon and successive operations shattered
    the North Korean Army, but the United Nations advance into North Korea led to
    Communist Chinese intervention. The entry of half a million Chinese troops in
    November 1950 drastically changed the war. Within weeks, advanced Soviet-made
    MiG-15 fighters appeared. Flown by North Korean, Chinese, and Soviet pilots,
    the MiG-15 outperformed American F-51, F-80, and F-84 aircraft. Lieutenant
    Russell Brown, flying an F-80C, shot down a MiG-15 in the world's first all-jet
    air battle on 8 November 1950. In response to the enemy's superior speed and
    altitude, Air Force leaders rushed the North American F-86 Sabre into action.
    The F-86 matched the MiG's speed and proved a more stable gun platform.</span></p>

    1950, Corporal Harry LaVene of the 91st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron,
    serving as gunner, scored the first B-29 victory over a jet by downing a
    MiG-15. LaVene's victory was the first of 27 MiGs shot down by B-29 gunners
    during the course of the war. Sergeant Billie Beach, a tail gunner on an
    Okinawa-based B-29, shot down two MiGs on 12 April 1951, a feat unmatched by
    any other gunner. His own plane was so shot up, however, that it and the crew
    barely survived an emergency landing with collapsed gear at an advanced fighter
    strip.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-498"><span id="SPAN-499">1.12.11. As the war on
    the ground settled into stalemate, F-86s battled over  MiG Alley,  where
    superior training and experience prevailed. F-86 pilots destroyed 792 MiGs and
    18 other enemy aircraft at a cost of 76 Sabres lost to MiGs, and 142 to other
    causes.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-500"><span id="SPAN-501">1.12.12. During the
    Korean War, the Air Rescue Service medically evacuated more than 9,600 wounded
    soldiers, and rescued nearly 1,000 personnel shot down over enemy territory. In
    addition, Air Resupply and Communication Service wings executed unconventional
    warfare and counterinsurgency operations against enemy forces.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-502"><span id="SPAN-503">1.12.13. During the
    Korean War, a new group of Air Force pilots entered the pantheon of fighter
    aces. The F-86 pilots established a remarkable 10-to-1 kill ratio. Captain
    Joseph McConnell, a B-24 navigator in World War II, led the pack with a score
    of 16, closely followed by Captain James Jabara who tallied 15 kills. Jabara
    gained recognition as the world's first jet ace. Unlike the mass squadron
    formations often flown in World War II, Korean War pilots devised new tactics
    based on flights of only four F-86s.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-504"><span id="SPAN-505">1.12.14. Despite success
    in the air war, the Korean War frustrated American airpower. Accustomed to the
    commitment of World War II, Korean War era leaders struggled under political,
    technological, and resource limitations inherent in the Cold War. Worried that
    the conflict in Korea foreshadowed a Soviet invasion of Europe, American policy
    makers limited operations in Asia in order to build up North Atlantic Treaty
    Organization forces. Nevertheless, United Nations forces repelled two communist
    invasions of South Korea, and American airpower secured the skies against enemy
    air attack.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-506"><span id="SPAN-507">1.12.15. After the
    Korean conflict, Air Force missile and space capabilities developed rapidly. In
    late 1953, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development,
    Trevor Gardner, convened a group of experts known as the</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-508"><span id="SPAN-509">Teapot Committee to
    examine the field of long-range missiles. The committee's 10 February 1954
    report recommended accelerating intercontinental ballistic missile development.
    Based on the recommendation, the Air Research and Development Command, on 1
    July 1954, established the Western Development Division in Inglewood,
    California, to develop and field intercontinental ballistic missiles. On 2
    August 1954, Brigadier General Bernard Schriever assumed command of the new
    organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-510"><span id="SPAN-511">1.12.16. Concurrent with
    efforts to develop long-range missiles, the United States also pursued space-based
    technology that could provide accurate information on Soviet military
    intentions. On 27 November 1954, Air Force senior leaders followed the
    recommendation of the RAND Corporation's Project Feed Back report, issuing
    Weapon System Requirement No. 5, directing development of an electro-optical
    reconnaissance satellite. Weapon System Requirement No. 5 later became weapon
    system 117L. The scope of weapon system 117L eventually broadened to include
    other space-based missions, such as meteorology, missile warning, and
    multispectral imaging.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-512"><span id="SPAN-513">1.12.17. On 4 October
    1957, the course of missile and satellite development changed when the Soviet
    Union successfully launched the Sputnik I satellite into earth orbit. The
    Soviet success marked the beginning of the space age and sparked the space race
    between the United States and Soviet Union. Over the next two decades the Air
    Force played a major role in the developing national space programs, assuming
    the mantle of America's air and space force. In response to the Sputnik I
    launch, President Eisenhower accelerated United States civil and military space
    efforts; a decision that would prove crucial throughout the Cold War.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-514"><span id="SPAN-515">1.12.18. In 1958, the
    Air Force developed plans for a manned military presence in space, but President
    Eisenhower reserved manned missions for the National Aeronautics and Space
    Agency. However, the Air Force's plan formed the basis of the Mercury, Gemini,
    and Apollo Programs. The Atlas rocket, which began as a United States Army Air
    Corps ballistic missile in October 1945, was used to launch the MERCURY
    missions. The Titan-II booster, also originally a ballistic missile, launched
    the Gemini astronauts. In fact, the Air Force and its contractors planned,
    built, and launched all of the Titan-II rockets in Project Gemini.</span></p>

    <p id="P-523"><span id="SPAN-524">1.12.19. In 1960, the
    National Reconnaissance Office was formed to take charge of highly classified
    reconnaissance satellites. President Eisenhower undertook several initiatives
    to help prevent a surprise nuclear attack against the United States, including
    establishing the classified Corona satellite photo reconnaissance program. This
    system, known publicly as the Discoverer research program, achieved its first
    successful launch of the Discoverer XIII, 10 August 1960. Corona employed a
    payload capsule that jettisoned from the orbiter, returned to earth by
    parachute, and was captured by an aircraft. Discoverer XIV, launched a week
    after recovering Discoverer XIII, shot over 3,000 feet of reconnaissance film
    from space, heralding the beginning of America's space-based photo
    reconnaissance capability.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-525"><span id="SPAN-526">1.12.20. The Air Force
    concentrated on unmanned missions to fulfill national security needs. Space
    reconnaissance satellites, for instance, supported strategic deterrence throughout
    the Cold War, providing invaluable knowledge of the Soviet Union's nuclear
    inventory, and verifying arms control treaty compliance. Space systems also
    provided early warning of any missile attack on North America, and worldwide
    communications platforms for strategic command and control.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-527"><b id="B-528"><span id="SPAN-529">1.13. Cuban Missile Crisis (1962):</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-530"><span id="SPAN-531">1.13.1. In 1959, Fidel
    Castro overthrew the dictator of Cuba, initially promising free elections, but
    instead he instituted a socialist dictatorship. Hundreds of thousands of Cubans
    fled their island, many coming to the United States. In late 1960, President
    Eisenhower authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to plan an invasion of
    Cuba using Cuban exiles as troops. President Eisenhower hoped that, in
    conjunction with the invasion, the Cuban people would overthrow Castro and
    install a pro-United States government. The President's second term ended
    before the plan could be implemented. President John F. Kennedy ordered the
    invasion to proceed. In mid-April 1961, the Cuban exiles landed at the Bay of
    Pigs and suffered a crushing defeat.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-532"><span id="SPAN-533"><img width="217" height="168" src="afh1_files/image035.png" id="IMG-534"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-535"><span id="SPAN-536">1.13.2. Following the
    failure of the United States-supported Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by Cuban
    exiles in April 1961, the Soviet Union increased economic and military aid to
    Cuba. In August 1962, the Soviets and Cubans started constructing intermediate-
    and medium-range ballistic missile complexes on the island. Suspicious, the
    United States intelligence community called for photographic investigation and
    verification of the activity. In October, Strategic Air Command U-2 aircraft
    deployed to McCoy Air Force Base, Florida, and began flying high-altitude
    reconnaissance flights over Cuba. On 15 October, photographs obtained on
    flights the previous day confirmed the construction of launch pads that, when
    completed, could be used to employ nuclear-armed missiles with a range up to
    5,000 miles. Eleven days later, RF101s and RB-66s began conducting low-level
    reconnaissance flights, verifying data gathered by the U-2s and gathering
    prestrike intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-537"><span id="SPAN-538">1.13.3. In the event an
    invasion of Cuba became necessary, Tactical Air Command deployed F-84, F-100,
    F-105, RB-66, and KB-50 aircraft to numerous bases in Florida. Meanwhile,
    Strategic Air Command prepared for general war by dispersing nuclear-capable B-47
    aircraft to approximately 40 airfields in the United States and keeping
    numerous B-52 heavy bombers in the air ready to strike.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-539"><span id="SPAN-540">1.13.4. Meanwhile,
    President Kennedy and his advisors on the national security team debated the
    most effective course of action. Many on the Joint Chiefs of Staff favored
    invasion, but President Kennedy took the somewhat less drastic step of imposing
    a naval blockade of the island, which was designed to prevent any more materiel
    from reaching Cuba. Still technically an act of war, the blockade nevertheless
    had the advantage of not turning the cold war into a hot one.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-541"><span id="SPAN-542">1.13.5. Confronted with
    the photographic evidence of missiles, the Soviet Union initially responded
    belligerently. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev accused the United States of
    degenerate imperialism and declared that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic
    would not observe the illegal blockade. In the ensuing days, Khrushchev
    softened, and then hardened, his position and demands. Tensions increased on 27
    October when Cuban air defenses shot down a U-2 piloted by Major Rudolf
    Anderson.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-543"><span id="SPAN-544">1.13.6. The Joint Chiefs
    of Staff recommended an immediate air strike against Cuba, but President
    Kennedy decided to wait. The increasing tempo in the military, however,
    continued unabated. While United States military preparations continued, the
    United States agreed not to invade Cuba in exchange for removal of Soviet
    missiles from the island. Secretly, the United States also agreed to remove
    American missiles from Turkey. The Soviets turned their Cuban-bound ships
    around, packed up the missiles in Cuba, and dismantled the launch pads. As the
    work progressed, the Air Force started to deploy aircraft back to home bases
    and lower the alert status.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-545"><span id="SPAN-546">1.13.7. The Cuban
    Missile Crisis brought the United States and the Soviet Union dangerously close
    to nuclear war; the world breathed a sigh of relief when it ended. The
    strategic and tactical power of the United States Air Force, coupled with the
    will and ability to use it, provided the synergy to deter nuclear war with the
    Union of Soviet Socialist Republic and convince the Soviet leaders to remove
    the nuclear weapons from Cuba.&nbsp;<b id="B-547"><i id="I-548">Section 1E Vietnam, Desert Storm and

    <p id="P-552"><span id="SPAN-553">1.14.1. After eight
    years, during which the Air Force worked to build America's strategic nuclear
    forces, President Kennedy's administration faced national wars of liberation
    backed by the Soviet Union. Responding to Communist efforts in Laos and South
    Vietnam, President Kennedy in April 1961 ordered Operation FARMGATE; the covert
    deployment of the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron (Jungle Jim) to train
    the South Vietnamese Air Force. Flying North American T-28 Trojans, Douglas
    A-26 Invaders, and Douglas A-1E Skyraiders, American pilots launched attack
    missions under the umbrella of combat training. Following the August 1964 Gulf
    of Tonkin incident, when North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked the USS&nbsp;<i id="I-554">Maddox</i>,
    President Lyndon B. Johnson lifted the shroud of secrecy and ordered an
    orchestrated air attack as a show of force. By December 1964, North American
    F-100 Super Sabres, McDonnell RF-101 Voodoos, and Republic F-105 Thunderchiefs,
    with Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker support, conducted Operation BARRELL ROLL,
    attacking Communist forces in Laos.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-555"><span id="SPAN-556"><img width="178" height="141" src="afh1_files/image036.png" id="IMG-557"></span></p>

    <p id="P-561"><span id="SPAN-562">1.14.2. Faced with a
    deteriorating political and military situation in South Vietnam, President
    Johnson ordered Operation ROLLING THUNDER; a sign of American support to South
    Vietnam and a signal of United States resolve. Beginning on 2 March 1965,
    Rolling Thunder was  a program of measured and limited air action against
    selected military targets in North Vietnam remaining south of the 19th
    Parallel.  Closely managed by the White House, Rolling Thunder sought to apply
    incrementally announced military power to undermine the North Vietnamese will
    to wage war. However, the United States underestimated the enemy's resiliency
    and determination. Air Force leaders chafed at rules of engagement that negated
    the speed, surprise, and flexibility of massed airpower. They believed periodic
    bombing pauses intended to signal American intentions allowed the enemy to
    recover. In 1965, North Vietnamese air defenses multiplied, including
    Soviet-made SA-2 surface-to-air missiles. Hanoi established an advanced
    radar-controlled air defense system that combined surface-to-air missiles,
    antiaircraft artillery, and Sovietproduced MiG-17 and MiG-21 interceptors.
    Consequently, United States losses mounted without any visible effect from the
    air campaign. By the fall of 1968, Air Force tactical aircraft had flown
    166,000 sorties over North Vietnam, and Navy attack aircraft added 144,500. In
    the process, the enemy downed 526 Air Force aircraft: surface-to-air missiles
    accounted for 54, MiGs destroyed 42, and antiaircraft artillery claimed the
    remainder. Personnel losses were equally heavy. Of the 745 Air Force crew
    members shot down over North Vietnam, 145 were rescued, 255 were confirmed
    killed, 222 were captured, and 123 were classified missing in action. Air Force
    leaders found these results intolerable for an air campaign with virtually
    complete air superiority.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-563"><span id="SPAN-564">1.14.3. Complementing
    operations over North Vietnam, the air war over South Vietnam demonstrated the
    full spectrum of airpower. Air Force aircraft and helicopters provided close
    air support, interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, tanker support, and
    search-and-rescue capabilities. Air Force resources ranged from one-man Cessna
    O-1 Bird Dogs, used by forward air controllers to mark enemy targets for
    strikers, to mammoth B-52Ds modified to drop as many as 27 750pound bombs, and
    84 500-pound bombs for Operation ARC LIGHT interdiction missions. Vintage World
    War II aircraft, like AC-47 Puff the Magic Dragon gunships, joined
    state-of-the-art platforms like the General Dynamics swingwing, advanced
    terrain-following radar F-111 Aardvark.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-565"><span id="SPAN-566">1.14.4. The January 1968
    siege of Khe Sanh displayed the potential of Air Force close air support. When
    more than</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-567"><span id="SPAN-568">20,000 North Vietnamese
    troops, protected by hilly, covered terrain, surrounded 6,000 United States
    Marines, General William Momyer applied massive firepower during Operation
    NIAGARA. A flight of three B-52s hit the enemy every 90 minutes for most of the
    77-day siege. To prevent the enemy from overrunning the base, American aircraft
    dropped 100,000 tons of bombs, two-thirds of those from B-52s.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-569"><span id="SPAN-570">1.14.5. Following the
    1968 bombing halt, President Richard M. Nixon initiated a phased withdrawal
    from the frustrating conflict. From 536,000 United States troops in 1968,
    American personnel numbered fewer than 100,000 by 1972. When the North
    Vietnamese launched the Easter Offensive in Spring 1972, Nixon resolved to
    achieve peace with honor. Reinforcing ground troops was politically impossible,
    so Nixon employed Operation LINEBACKER to blunt the Communist attack.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-571"><span id="SPAN-572">1.14.6. Unlike Rolling
    Thunder, military leaders were allowed to use appropriate strategy and tactics,
    in part because the administration significantly reduced restrictions. With the
    acquisition of precision-guided munitions, new television and laser-guided
    smart bombs dramatically increased strike accuracy.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-573"><span id="SPAN-574">1.14.7. On 13 May 1972,
    16 McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantoms hit the Than Hoa bridge with 24 smart bombs,
    destroying a target that had eluded American Airmen for years. From April to
    October 1972, Air Force and Navy aircraft dropped 155,548 tons of bombs on
    North Vietnamese troops. The era's first war aces earned their marks during
    Linebacker, as well. On 28 August 1972, Captain Steve Ritchie shot down his
    fifth MiG- 21. Within weeks, two F-4 weapons systems officers joined the
    fraternity of aces: Captain Charles De Bellevue with six kills and Captain
    Jeffrey Feinstein with five. When North Vietnamese negotiators accepted
    specific peace conditions, President Nixon terminated the air campaign.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-575"><span id="SPAN-576">1.14.8. In December
    1972, North Vietnamese intransigence over the final peace agreement prompted
    President Nixon to initiate Linebacker II, an intense 11-day air campaign to
    pressure enemy compliance. From 18-29 December, American aircraft pounded
    military and industrial targets in North Vietnam. For the first time, the White
    House authorized B-52 strikes near Hanoi. In less than two weeks, 729 B-52
    sorties dropped 15,000 tons of bombs and fighter-bombers added another 5,000
    tons. Despite the loss of 26 aircraft, including 15 B-52s, airpower broke the
    impasse. Peace talks resumed 8 January 1973, and a comprehensive ceasefire was
    signed 23 January.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-577"><span id="SPAN-578">1.14.9. During Vietnam,
    airpower demonstrated its versatility and wide ranging impact, as well as its
    limitations. Despite an impressive military showing, the United States did not
    win decisively in Vietnam. Although the Air Force flew more than five million
    sorties and dropped six million tons of bombs, North Vietnamese forces
    eventually conquered South Vietnam in April 1975. Airpower did not prevent the
    collapse of the South Vietnamese government or the change in American political
    climate.</span></p>

    The Vietnam War saw a number of notable and heroic achievements by Air Force
    enlisted members, including two winners of the Medal of Honor, who will be
    discussed in detail in a later section of this chapter. While not a Medal of
    Honor recipient, Duane Hackney became one of the most honored heroes of the
    Vietnam War, the recipient of 28 decorations for valor in combat (more than 70
    awards and decorations in all), and winner of the Cheney Award for 1967, an
    honor presented for valor or self-sacrifice in a humanitarian effort. Hackney
    enlisted in the Air Force a few days after graduation, volunteering for
    pararescue training. An honor graduate in every phase of the tough, year-long
    course, he had his choice of assignments. Airman Second Class Hackney turned
    down assignments in Bermuda and England for Detachment 7, 38th Aerospace Rescue
    and Recovery Squadron, at Da Nang. Hackney flew more than 200 combat missions
    in three and a half years of Vietnam duty, all as a volunteer. He earned four
    Distinguished Flying Crosses for specific acts of heroism and 18 Air Medals,
    many for single acts of valor. He also received the Air Force Cross, the Silver
    Star, the Airman's Medal, the Purple Heart, and several foreign decorations.
    Hackney's most celebrated mission was on 6 February 1967. That morning he
    descended from a HH-3E Jolly Green Giant to look for a downed pilot near Mu Gia
    pass. The pilot had stopped his radio transmissions, a clue that enemy troops
    were nearby. For two hours, Hackney searched for the man, dodging enemy
    patrols, until the mission was called off because of weather. Late that
    afternoon, the downed pilot came back on the air, and Hackney's crew headed for
    the rescue area to get him out before dark. This time Hackney found his man,
    badly injured but alive, got him onto the forest penetrator, and started up to
    the chopper, drawing small-arms fire all the way. As the men were hauled
    aboard, the helicopter took a direct hit from a 37-mm antiaircraft gun and
    burst into flame. Wounded by shell fragments and suffering third-degree burns,
    Hackney, knowing that the HH-3 was not going to make it, put his own parachute
    on the rescued pilot and got him out of the doomed chopper. Groping through
    dense smoke, he found an oil-soaked chute and slipped it on. Before he could
    buckle the chute, a second 37-mm shell hit the HH-3, blowing him out the door.
    He did not remember pulling the ripcord of the unbuckled chute before hitting
    trees 250 feet below, then plunging 80 feet to a rock ledge in a crevasse. When
    he regained consciousness, enemy troops were leaping across the crevasse a few
    feet above him Once they were gone, Hackney popped his smoke and was picked up
    by the backup chopper. There were no other survivors from the rescue
    helicopter. For that mission, Hackney received the Air Force Cross. In 1973,
    Hackney left the Air Force, one of the most decorated pararescuemen of the
    Vietnam War. Four years later, missing the camaraderie of Air Force life, he
    enlisted again, returning to duty as a pararescue instructor. In 1981, he
    suffered a severe heart attack, the result of a rescue operation, and was
    permanently grounded. Altogether, he served in the United States Air Force from
    1965 to 1991, retiring as a Chief Master Sergeant.</span></p>

    conventional Air Force after Vietnam began with personnel changes. The
    Vietnam-era Air Force included many members who had entered its ranks in World
    War II. President Nixon ended the draft in 1973 in favor of an all-volunteer
    American military. The Air Force attracted recruits as best it could but
    encountered problems with the racial friction and alcohol and drug abuse that
    reflected America's social problems. Enough Vietnam career veterans remained,
    however, to direct the new service and implement changes. One of the most
    notable of those changes was more realistic- more dangerous- combat training.
    In combat simulations, Air Force pilots flew as aggressors employing enemy
    tactics. By 1975, training had evolved into Red Flag at the United States Air
    Force Weapons and Tactics Center, Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. Red Flag
    aircrews flew both individual sorties and formations in realistic situations to
    gain application experience before actual combat. Colonel Richard  Moody  Suter
    is the founder of Red Flag. As a major, working in the Pentagon in 1975, he saw
    his vision through to fruition. Red Flag revolutionized Air Force training.
    According to senior leaders at the time, Colonel Suter's efforts resulted in a
    program that made the United States Air Force the premier air arm of the world.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-609"><span id="SPAN-610">1.15.2. An innovative
    genius, Suter flew more than 200 combat missions in Vietnam and was the first
    F-15 Eagle squadron commander. In addition to Red Flag, he is credited with
    founding the Air Force aggressor squadron, and the Einsiedlerhof Air Station,
    Germany Warrior Preparation Center, used to train senior battle commanders in
    the art of war. Suter was the driving force behind Checkmate, the Air Force
    think tank for wartime scenarios. After his death in January 1996, the Warrior
    Preparation Center Command Section Building and Red Flag Building, Nellis Air
    Force Base, Nevada, were named in his honor.</span></p>

    <p id="P-614"><span id="SPAN-615">1.15.3. Post-Vietnam
    rebuilding included applying technology improvements. The battle for control of
    the skies over North Vietnam emphasized the need for a highly maneuverable
    dogfighting aircraft armed with missiles and cannon. The F-15 Eagle and F-16
    Fighting Falcon filled this need. The danger posed by radar-guided antiaircraft
    artillery and surface-to-air missiles in Vietnam drove the Air Force to develop
    stealth technology: special paints, materials, and designs to reduce or
    eliminate aircraft radar, thermal, and electronic signatures. Operational by
    October 1980, the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter featured detection avoidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-616"><span id="SPAN-617">1.15.4. Other Vietnam
    War technologies included precision-guided munitions and smart bombs. From
    April 1972 to January 1973, the United States used more than 4,000 early smart
    weapons to destroy bridges and enemy tanks. Laserguided bombs, electro-optically-guided
    missiles, and other precision technologies changed Air Force doctrine from its
    focus on strategic bombing to pinpoint bombing focused on destroying enemy s
    industrial web chokepoints with economy of force and no collateral damage. To
    overcome numerically superior Warsaw Pact forces, the Air Force worked with the
    Army to update the air-land battle tactical doctrine published in Field Manual
    100-5. The Air Force would make deep air attacks on an enemy army to isolate it
    on the battlefield, conduct battlefield air interdiction to prevent enemy
    reinforcements from reaching the front, disrupt the movement of secondary
    forces to the front, and provide close air support to Army ground forces. The
    Air Force procured the A-10 Thunderbolt II in the 1970s to support such
    missions.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-618"><span id="SPAN-619">1.15.5. Operation RICE
    BOWL, the April 1980 attempt to rescue American hostages from the United States
    embassy in</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-620"><span id="SPAN-621">Iran,
    ended in disaster at the Desert One refueling site. Inquiries led to the
    reorganization and revitalization of United States Special Operations Forces.
    Crisis support missions during the 1980s allowed the Air Force to test new
    ideas and technologies. During Operation URGENT FURY, October 1983, American
    forces rescued American students and restored order to Grenada. The Air Force
    primarily transported troops and cargo, but discovered problems with command,
    control, planning, and intraservice &amp; interservice coordination during the
    operation. In April 1986, President Reagan mobilized England- based F-111s to
    strike Libya during Operation ELDORADO CANYON. The counterterrorism operation
    exposed on-going target identification and intelligence difficulties,
    punctuated by inaccurate bombing. Finally, Operation JUST CAUSE in 1989 tested
    air operations; this time in Panama. The Air Force primarily airlifted troops
    and supplies, but also debuted the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, with an
    AC-130 Spectre gunship, intimidating Panamanian troops loyal to dictator Manuel
    Noriega.</span></p>

    <p id="P-625"><span id="SPAN-626">1.15.6. President
    Kennedy's flexible-response nuclear war doctrine of the early 1960s lacked the
    technology to match its vision of adapting to meet various Cold War crises.
    Advances in geodesy, cartography, missile and satellite guidance system
    integrated circuits significantly improved missile accuracy. Technology
    improvements resulted in better targeting systems and smaller, more effective
    warheads. Because they were smaller and lighter, more warheads could be mounted
    to intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine launched ballistic
    missiles. In the early 1970s, the Department of Defense developed multiple
    independently targetable reentry vehicles, allowing three or more warheads to
    be mounted on each intercontinental ballistic missile and submarine launched
    ballistic missiles. The Air Force arsenal peaked at 1,054 Titan and Minuteman
    intercontinental ballistic missiles, but many carried three multiple
    independently targetable reentry vehicles, as opposed to earlier models that
    carried a single warhead. In spite of technological advances, planned targets
    continued to support the doctrine of mutually assured destruction or the
    capacity to eradicate an enemy's society, even after an attack on United States
    forces.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-627"><span id="SPAN-628">1.15.7. Mutually assured
    destruction doctrine was based on the theory that superpower strategic nuclear
    forces could be sized and protected to survive a nuclear attack in order to
    retaliate with sufficient force to destroy the other side. Such retaliatory
    destruction was deterrent insurance because no rational leader would consider
    starting a nuclear war knowing that the result would be nuclear
    destruction.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-629"><span id="SPAN-630">1.15.8. For two decades
    the Air Force developed more capable satellite systems, such as the Missile
    Defense Alarm</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-631"><span id="SPAN-632">System, which was the
    first attempt at a space-based long-range missile attack detection and warning
    system. Missile Defense Alarm System 7, launched 9 May 1963, validated the
    concept of infrared sensing from a nearly circular 2,000mile orbit. The need
    for accurate information on Soviet nuclear testing led to the development of a
    space-based system that could specifically detect nuclear explosions. In
    September 1959, Department of Defense directed the Advanced Research Projects
    Agency to develop the Vela Hotel nuclear detection program; a low-cost,
    automated nuclear detection satellite constellation. The first pair of Vela
    satellites was launched from Cape Canaveral, 16 October 1963, and detected a
    nuclear blast the next day. Extensive United States and Soviet spending for
    weapons and related systems escalated into what appeared to be an unlimited
    strategic arms race.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-633"><span id="SPAN-634">1.15.9. However, on 26
    May 1972, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed
    the AntiBallistic Missile Treaty, limiting each country to two Anti-Ballistic
    Missile sites: one to protect the national capital and an intercontinental
    ballistic missile complex. The treaty served to reinforce the notion of the
    mutually assured destruction doctrine as a deterrent. The Strategic Arms
    Limitation Treaty, which was signed at the same time, limited the number of
    nuclear weapons, with the objective of obtaining a verified freeze on the
    numerical growth and destabilizing characteristics of each side's strategic
    nuclear forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-635"><span id="SPAN-636">1.15.10. Satellite
    advances significantly enhanced weather and communications support. The Air
    Force vision of weather satellites was realized with the development of a
    dedicated military weather satellite system known initially as the Defense
    Satellite Applications Program. Early Defense Satellite Applications Program
    military weather satellites were relatively unsophisticated, weighing about 430
    pounds. The Initial Defense Satellite Communications Program, launched 16 June
    1966, was one of the earliest Air Force satellite communication systems.
    Another benefit of early satellites was improved navigation. Although the Navy
    produced the first working satellite navigation system (Transit), an early Air
    Force navigation satellite program was designed to provide precise time and
    navigation information in three dimensions. Later, a joint Air Force and Navy
    program would result in what became known as the NAVSTAR Global Positioning
    System.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-637"><span id="SPAN-638"><img width="177" height="177" src="afh1_files/image041.png" id="IMG-639"></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-640"><span id="SPAN-641">1.15.11.
    Increased defense spending during the early 1980s resulted in more mature space
    and missile programs (most of which are still in service) to replace the
    systems developed in the 1960s and 1970s. These included the Defense Support</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-642"><span id="SPAN-643">Program,
    the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, the Defense Satellite
    Communications System, and the Global Positioning System. Concurrently, the Air
    Force developed the ground-based infrastructure to support, augment, and
    complement the space-based portions of the systems. Ground-based systems
    included the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System; orbiting space object
    surveillance using Baker-Nunn cameras; and the Air Force Satellite Control
    Network. In addition, the Air Force developed launch support bases necessary to
    get satellites into space   one at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the other at
    Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The launch bases provided support not only
    for Department of Defense sponsored systems but also for National Aeronautics
    and Space Agency, other United States government agencies, and commercial
    requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-644"><span id="SPAN-645">1.15.12. In the late
    1970s and early 1980s, the time had come to substantially reorganize the way
    the service managed its space systems. Chief of Staff, Air Force General Lew
    Allen appeared with Under Secretary of the Air Force Pete Aldridge, 21 June
    1982 to announce the formation of Space Command, with activation slated for 1
    September 1982. Air Force Space Command's responsibilities grew quickly over
    the ensuing decade as it absorbed programs from Aerospace Defense Command, Air
    Force Systems Command, and Strategic Air Command. Eventually command missions
    included missile warning, space surveillance, satellite control, space defense,
    space support to operational forces, and launch operations. The organizational
    changes that led to the establishment of Space Command reflected a growth in
    the use of space systems in support of worldwide joint operations.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-646"><span id="SPAN-647">1.15.13. In a 23 March
    1983 address, President Ronald Reagan proposed replacing the doctrine of
    mutually assured destruction with one of assured survival, through
    implementation of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Strategic Defense Initiative
    would include a combination of defensive systems such as space-based lasers,
    particle beams, railguns, and fast ground-launched missiles, among others, to
    intercept intercontinental ballistic missiles in the earth's outer atmosphere
    and ballistic path in space. The end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet
    Union eliminated the justification for the level of research and development
    associated with the project, although research continued at a much-lower level
    under the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.</span><span id="SPAN-648"> </span></p>

    <p id="P-659"><span id="SPAN-660">1.15.14. Beginning in
    March 1985, Soviet Communist Party General-Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev
    initiated major changes in Soviet-American relations. The Intermediate Range
    Nuclear Forces Treaty, in December 1987, eliminated medium-range nuclear
    missiles, including United States Air Force ground-launched cruise missiles.
    Gorbachev's announcement in May 1988 that the Soviet Union, after nine years
    of&nbsp;</span><b id="B-661"><sub id="SUB-662"><span id="SPAN-663">&nbsp;</span></sub></b><span id="SPAN-664">inconclusive combat, would withdraw from the war
    in Afghanistan resulted in reduced Cold War tension, but it was only a hint of
    the rapid changes ahead. Relatively free and open Russian national elections in
    March 1989, followed by a coal miner strike in July, shook the foundations of
    Communist rule. East Germany opened the Berlin Wall in November which led to
    German reunification in October 1990. The August 1991 coup against Gorbachev,
    led by Boris Yeltsin, resulted in the dissolution of the Soviet Union, replaced
    25 December 1991 by the Commonwealth of Independent States.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-665"><span id="SPAN-666">1.15.15. American
    nuclear strategy changed significantly in response to these changes. Under the
    Strategic Arms</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-667"><span id="SPAN-668">Reduction Treaty I,
    signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in July 1991, the Air Force
    would reduce arms to 6,000 total warheads on deployed intercontinental
    ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers.
    Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II, signed in January 1993, would reduce total
    deployed warheads up to a range of 3,500 nautical miles. The resulting force
    structure (determined during the Nuclear Posture Review process overseen by
    then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin), would ultimately lead to the deployment
    of 500 single-warhead Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, 66
    B-52H, and 20 B-2 heavy bombers. Ninety-four B-1 heavy bombers would be
    reoriented to a conventional role by 2003, and all Peacekeeper intercontinental
    ballistic missiles would be removed from active inventory and associated silo
    launchers eliminated. The Air Force, by presidential direction in September
    1991, notified Strategic Air Command to remove heavy bombers from alert status.
    Strategic Air Command was subsequently inactivated in June 1992. United States
    Strategic Command, a unified combatant command, replaced Strategic Air Command
    and assumed control of all remaining Air Force and Navy strategic nuclear
    forces.</span></p>

    <p id="P-672"><span id="SPAN-673">1.16.1. On 2 August

    Nations authorized an economic embargo. The same day, President George H. W.
    Bush announced Operation DESERT SHIELD, the deployment of United States air and
    ground units to defend Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf states. Within 18 hours of
    the order, Air Force Military Airlift Command C-141 and C-5 transports

    <p id="P-681"><span id="SPAN-682">1.16.2.
    Operation DESERT SHIELD eclipsed the Berlin Airlift as the greatest air
    deployment in history. Military Airlift Command cargo planes delivered
    defensive forces 7 August - 8 November 1990, brought counteroffensive material
    9 November - January 1991. The air bridge spanned more than 7,000 miles and
    included 20,500 strategic airlift missions. Desert Shield validated the C-5A
    Galaxy and C-141 Starlifter large capacity heavy lifters, which carried 534,000
    passengers and 542,000 tons of cargo during the Gulf War.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-683"><span id="SPAN-684">1.16.3. The Gulf War represents the first, extensive, broad-based
    employment of space support capabilities. Coalition forces employed more than
    60 military satellites, as well as commercial and civil sector systems during
    the conflict.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-685"><span id="SPAN-686">Defense Meteorological
    Satellite Program provided dedicated meteorological support in theater, which
    helped provide safe, highly effective combat power planning and application in
    a harsh environment characterized by sandstorms and oil fires. Satellite-based
    systems delivered more than 90 percent of all communications to and from the
    theater due to the sheer volume and the lack of ground-based infrastructure. At
    the height of the conflict, 700,000 phone calls and 152,000 messages per day
    flowed over satellite links.</span></p>

    <p id="P-692"><span id="SPAN-693">1.16.5. Within hours,
    the world watched live television coverage of Iraqi skies filled with
    antiaircraft artillery fire. F-117A Nighthawks struck heavily defended targets
    with unprecedented precision. Under the command of Lieutenant General Charles
    A. Horner, United States Central Command Air Forces, 2,700 aircraft from 14
    countries and services implemented the master attack plan. The coalition effort
    overwhelmed the Iraqi air defense system with speed, surprise, precision, and
    mass. A flight of seven B-52Gs flew nonstop from Barksdale Air Force Base
    Louisiana to strike Iraqi power stations and communications facilities with Air
    Launched Cruise Missiles. At 35 hours round-trip, the 14,000-mile raid was the
    longest combat mission up to that time and proof of America's global reach.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-694"><span id="SPAN-695">1.16.6. The first week
    of Desert Storm focused on achieving air supremacy and destroying the enemy s
    command and control system. Captain Jon K.  JB  Kelk, flying an F-15C, scored
    the first air-to-air kill, downing an Iraqi MiG-29. All total, coalition aircraft
    shot down 41 Iraqi aircraft, with Captain Thomas N.  Vegas' Dietz and First
    Lieutenant Robert W.  Gigs' Hehemann each credited with three kills.
    Additionally, Allied air forces destroyed 375 enemy aircraft and 594 hardened
    bunkers. Faced with coalition air dominance, 148 Iraqi aircraft fled to
    neighboring Iran.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-696"><span id="SPAN-697">1.16.7. The air campaign
    then prepared the battlefield by isolating Iraqi ground units, interdicting
    supplies, and reducing enemy combat power. A-10 Thunderbolt II  Warthogs' and
    F-15Es introduced a new term -tank plinking - as they destroyed the enemy s
    armored forces. F-111F  Aardvarks' dropped 4,600 of the 8,000 precision-guided
    munitions.&nbsp; EF-111A electronic warfare aircraft provided tactical
    jamming, while combined RC- 135 Rivet Joint, E-8 Joint Surveillance Target
    Attack Radar System (Joint STARS), and E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System
    aircraft provided intelligence and command and control. Perhaps the most
    spectacular element: B-52s shattered Iraqi Army morale with massive bomb drops.
    When one Iraqi commander asserted that he surrendered because of B-52 strikes,
    his interrogator pointed out that his position had never been attacked by the
    B-52.  That is true, but I saw one that had been attacked,  said the
    Iraqi.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-698"><span id="SPAN-699">1.16.8. Not all aspects
    of the air campaign were successful. Early in the campaign, Iraq launched
    modified Soviet Scud missiles against Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Persian
    Gulf states. On 18 January 1991, United States Air Force A-10s,&nbsp;
    F-16s, and F-15Es with Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night
    pods commenced the Great Scud Hunt. Despite 2,767 sorties (22 percent of the
    strategic air phase), air patrols did not destroy a significant number of the
    missiles. Iraqi camouflage, decoys, and employment tactics frustrated the
    effort. The enemy launched 88 Scuds, including one that struck a United States
    Army Reserve unit at Dhahran, killing 28 soldiers and wounding 98. The antiScud
    effort did limit Scud launches after the first 2 weeks of fighting and reduced the
    political impact of the weapon.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-700"><span id="SPAN-701">1.16.9. The Desert Storm
    air campaign demonstrated airpower's impact on a conventional battlefield. Air
    Force space assets provided precision positioning and navigation to joint and
    coalition forces with the combat debut of the Global Positioning System. Space
    forces also provided the coalition and allies with advanced Iraqi Scud launch
    warnings. Defense Support Program gave timely warning of the launch of Iraqi
    Scud missiles to United States forces in theater and allowed Patriot batteries
    in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait sufficient time to engage the incoming
    Iraqi intermediate range ballistic missiles. Space force capabilities
    influenced Israel to remain neutral, thereby preserving the integrity of the
    allied coalition. Over the course of the 44-day air campaign, the coalition
    flew 118,661 sorties, of which the Air Force flew 60 percent. The 1991 Persian
    Gulf War brought military space operations to the joint community. The Gulf War
    was the first conflict to highlight the force enhancement capabilities of
    space-based communications, intelligence, navigation, missile warning, and
    weather satellites. Desert Storm also demonstrated the impact of
    precision-guided munitions on modern war. Although precision-guided munitions accounted
    for only eight percent of the 88,500 tons of bombs dropped, they were
    responsible for 80 percent of the destroyed targets. While coalition ground
    forces delivered General Schwarzkopf's famous Hail Mary outflanking maneuver
    that applied the final blow to the Iraqi military forces, airpower set the
    stage for victory. As the Gulf War Air Power Survey stated: It was not the
    number of Iraqi tanks or artillery pieces destroyed, or the number of Iraqi
    soldiers killed that mattered. It was the effectiveness of the air campaign in
    breaking apart the organizational structure and cohesion of enemy military
    forces and in reaching the mind of the Iraqi soldier that counted.</span></p>

    the wake of a two-year civil war contributed to a famine in Somalia that killed
    up to 350,000 people in 1992. As many as 800,000 refugees fled the stricken
    country. The United Nations-led relief effort began in July 1992. To relieve the
    suffering of refugees near the Kenya-Somalia border and then Somalia itself,
    the United States initiated Operation PROVIDE RELIEF in August 1992. By
    December, the United States airlifted 38 million pounds of food into the
    region, sometimes under the hail of small arms fire. Continued civil war and
    clan fighting within Somalia, however, prevented much of the relief supplies
    from getting into the hands of those who most desperately needed them.</span></p>

    Hercules, and even KC-10 tankers rushed supplies into the country. Further, the
    Operation RESTORE HOPE airlift brought 32,000 United States troops into
    Somalia. In March 1993, the United Nations once again assumed control of the
    mission, and Operation RESTORE HOPE officially ended 4 May 1993. Fewer than
    5,000 of the 25,000 United States troops originally deployed remained in
    Somalia. Unfortunately, factional fighting within the country caused the relief
    effort to unravel yet again. On 3 October 1993, United States special forces
    troops, in an effort to capture members of one clan, lost 18 personnel and
    suffered 84 wounded.&nbsp;</span></p>

    pararescueman with the 24th Special Tactics Squadron, responded with his crew
    to the downing of a United States UH-60 helicopter in the streets of Mogadishu,
    Somalia. Wilkinson repeatedly exposed himself to intense enemy small arms fire while
    extracting the wounded and dead crewmembers from the crashed helicopter.
    Despite his own wounds, he provided life-saving medical treatment to the
    wounded crewmembers. With the helicopter crew taken care of, he turned to aid
    the casualties of a ranger security element engaged in an intense firefight
    across an open four-way intersection from his position where he began immediate
    medical treatment. His decisive actions, personal courage, and bravery under
    heavy enemy fire were integral to the success of all casualty treatment and
    evacuation efforts conducted in the intense 18-hour combat engagement.

    of 1,700 United States troops and 3,100 tons of cargo into Mogadishu between 5
    and 13 October 1993. The troops and equipment were tasked with only stabilizing
    the situation: President Clinton refused to commit the United States to  nation

    RESTORE HOPE II officially ended 25 March 1994 when the last C-5 carrying
    United States troops departed Mogadishu. While Operation RESTORE HOPE II
    allowed United States forces to get out of the country without further

    <p id="P-728"><span id="SPAN-729">1.18.1. The post-Cold
    War breakup of Yugoslavia proved to be NATO's greatest challenge in the 1990s.
    Militant Serbian nationalism and a policy of ethnic cleansing, promoted by
    Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic, created a crisis in Kosovo in 1999.
    Meanwhile, Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army fanned the flames
    of violence. When diplomacy failed, NATO worried about the possibility of a
    genocidal civil war and destabilization throughout the Balkans. As NATO debated
    intervention, President Milosevic unleashed a ruthless offensive designed to
    crush the Kosovo Liberation Army and drive ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo.
    Faced with a massive humanitarian crisis, NATO turned to airpower.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-730"><span id="SPAN-731">1.18.2. After Desert
    Storm in early 1992, Chief of Staff, Air Force General Merrill McPeak,
    introduced a revamped Air Force mission: Defend the United States through
    control and exploitation of air and space. Resultant organizational changes
    permitted the Air Force to attain an unprecedented level of integration between
    air and space capabilities by the time the Air War over Serbia commenced in
    1999. During Air War over Serbia, Air Force Space Command deployed nearly 150
    space professionals to nine locations in theater. During the conflict,
    multisource Tactical System/Combat Track I modifications to five B-52s and two
    B-1s allowed near real-time information to flow to the cockpits. The
    spaceenabled information included threats, target updates, imagery, and secure
    communications with the wing operations center. Global Positioning System
    satellites provided terminal guidance data for Joint Direct Attack Munitions, Conventional
    Air Launched Cruise Missiles, and Tomahawk Land Attack Missile deliveries. This
    conflict was the first operational employment of Joint Direct Attack Munitions,
    demonstrating precision adverse weather delivery of multiple weapons against
    multiple aim points on a single pass.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-732"><span id="SPAN-733">1.18.3. Optimistic
    policymakers looked to NATO's successful two-week Operation DELIBERATE FORCE in
    1995 that brought relative peace to Bosnia. On 24 March 1999, President Bill
    Clinton commenced Operation ALLIED FORCE, announcing three objectives:
    demonstrate NATO's opposition to aggression; deter Milosevic from escalating
    attacks on civilians; and damage Serbia's capability to wage war against
    Kosovo. Milosevic and Serbian forces presented United States and NATO forces
    with an opponent with a capacity for skilled propaganda and utter ruthlessness.
    The ensuing 78day battle was directed against both the Serbian military and
    Milosevic's propaganda efforts.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-734"><span id="SPAN-735">1.18.4. From 24 March to
    9 June 1999, NATO air forces walked a political tightrope. In over 38,000
    sorties, 13 of NATO's 19 nations attempted to pressure Milosevic, destroy
    Serbian fielded forces engaged in Kosovo, and maintain popular support for
    intervention. Initially, 214 strike aircraft followed a limited air campaign
    against approximately 50 targets.&nbsp;</span></p>

    stealth bomber flew its first combat missions from Whiteman Air Force Base,
    Missouri, delivering 650 Joint Direct Attack Munitions in 49 30-hour sorties.
    On 27 March 1999, Serb air defenses shot down an Air Force F-117, but Combat
    Search and Rescue personnel recovered the pilot. After weeks of caution and
    frustration, NATO expanded the scale of the air campaign: 563 United States Air
    Force aircraft and 13,850 American Airmen deployed to 24 locations.&nbsp;</span></p>

    NATO airpower accomplished its objectives, although complex political
    constraints, abysmal flying weather, and a Serbianmanufactured refugee crisis
    hampered progress. Despite a concerted effort to avoid civilian casualties, at
    least 20 major incidents occurred, including the 7 May 1999 accidental bombing
    of the Chinese embassy.&nbsp;</span></p>

    means available to coerce an implacable foe. Assessments of Operation ALLIED
    FORCE concluded that air and ground commanders must agree on the enemy s

    2001, 19 Islamic extremist Al Qaeda terrorists highjacked four airliners and
    flew them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a remote field in
    Pennsylvania, killing about 3,000 people. In response, President George W. Bush
    declared a global war on terrorism. Operation NOBLE EAGLE immediately focused
    on protecting the United States homeland from both internal and external air
    attacks of the nature used on September 11. United States Air Force fighter,
    tanker, and surveillance air assets provided 24-hour intercept response
    coverage for virtually the entire United States in the form of ground alert and
    airborne combat air patrols over designated locations.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-753"><span id="SPAN-754">1.19.2. Operation

    Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and other nations to

    On 7 October 2001, 15 Air Force bombers, 25 Navy carrierstrike aircraft, and 50
    United States and British sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles launched the
    first wave of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM military operations. In the opening
    days of the campaign, joint airpower destroyed Taliban air defenses, command
    centers, and other fixed targets, and protected humanitarian relief missions to
    the Afghan people. In contrast to Desert Storm and Allied Force, Taliban and Al
    Qaeda forces presented few fixed targets suitable for air attack. Instead, Air
    Force B-52 bombers carrying Global Positioning System-guided Joint Direct
    Attack Munitions flew to engagement zones where ground-based forces directed
    attacks. Global Positioning System-guided munitions were employed with great
    accuracy, enabling air planners to reduce the number of air sorties required to
    destroy a particular objective. Combat operations in Afghanistan began with
    small groups of elite American military forces deployed to support anti-Taliban
    Afghani fighters. A number of the deployed troops carried 2.75-pound Precision
    Lightweight Global Positioning System Receivers and satellite-based
    communications devices. Air Force combat controllers were among the 300 or so
    Army, Navy, and Air Force special operations personnel augmenting the Afghan
    Northern Alliance. On 13 November 2001, the Afghanistan capital, Kabul, fell to
    coalition forces.</span></p>

    called it Operation ANACONDA and the press referred to it as the battle at
    Shah-I-Kot Mountain, but the men who fought there called it the battle of
    Robert's Ridge. In the early morning hours, on a mountaintop called Takur Ghar
    in southeastern Afghanistan, al Qaeda soldiers fired on an MH-47E helicopter,
    causing a Navy SEAL to fall to the ground, and a chain of events ensued
    culminating in one of the most intense small-unit firefights of the war against
    terrorism, the death of all the al Qaeda terrorists defending the mountaintop,
    and the death of seven United States servicemen. Despite these losses, the
    United States forces involved in this fight distinguished themselves by
    conspicuous bravery. Their countless acts of heroism demonstrated the best of
    America's Special Operations Forces as Air Force, Army, and Navy special

    Technical Sergeant John A. Chapman. It was only the third time since the end of
    the Vietnam conflict that an enlisted Airman received the Air Force Cross and
    the second time that it went to one of the enlisted Airman who died in what
    became a 17-hour ordeal on top of Takur Ghar mountain in Afghanistan. Chapman s
    helicopter came under enemy fire, causing a Navy SEAL to fall out of a MH-47
    helicopter during an insertion under fire. The helicopter landed 4.5 miles away
    from where the SEAL was killed. Once on the ground, Chapman provided directions
    to another helicopter to pick them up. After being rescued, Chapman and the
    team volunteered to rescue their mission team member from the enemy stronghold.
    After landing, Chapman killed two enemy soldiers and, without regard for his

    bases challenged coalition forces. (Navy aircraft flew 700 miles one way from
    carriers, and Air Force bombers ventured 2,500 miles one way from Diego
    Garcia.) Air Force KC- 135 tankers, C-17 and C-130 airlifters, Red Horse civil
    engineer teams, spacebased Global Positioning System and intelligence-gathering
    satellites, and other support functions proved to be unsung heroes of the
    campaign. Their effectiveness reduced combat troop casualties. In the first 18
    months, the Air Force flew more than 85,000 sorties (75 percent of the total
    effort), dropped 30,750 munitions, delivered 487,000 tons of cargo, and
    provided 3,025 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. Even

    anyone besides Saddam Hussein. On 17 March 2003, President George W. Bush
    announced a 48hour ultimatum for Saddam and his sons to leave Iraq or face
    conflict. Saddam rejected President Bush's ultimatum to flee, and on 20 March a

    DESERT STORM. Operation IRAQI FREEDOM officially began on 20 March 2003, and
    the primary combat phase ended on 1 May 2003. The Pentagon unleashed air
    strikes so devastating they would leave Saddam's soldiers unable or unwilling
    to fight. Between 300 and 400 cruise missiles were fired at targets, more than
    the number launched during the entire first Gulf War. On the second day, the
    plan called for launching another 300 to 400 missiles. The battle plan was
    based on a concept developed at the National Defense University. Called  Shock
    and Awe,  it focused on the psychological destruction of the enemy's will to
    fight rather than the physical destruction of the opposing military force. The
    concept relies on a large number of precision-guided weapons hitting the enemy
    simultaneously, much like a nuclear weapon strike that takes minutes instead of
    days or weeks to work.</span></p>

    March, and by 2 April, the Baghdad and Medina divisions of Iraq's Republican
    Guard were defeated. United States soldiers seized bridges over the Tigris and
    Euphrates rivers and then advanced within 25 miles of Baghdad. The next day,
    United States Army units along with Air Force special tactics combat
    controllers, pararescuemen, and combat weathermen attacked Saddam International
    Airport, 10 miles southwest of the capital. Two days later American-armored
    vehicles drove through Baghdad after smashing through Republican Guard units.
    On 7 April, United States tanks rumbled through downtown Baghdad and a B 1B

    accompanying Sather's Bronze Star Medal with Valor reads,  He led this
    reconnaissance task force on combat operations into Iraq on the first day of
    the ground war, breeching enemy fortifications during the Iraqi border
    crossing. During the next several days Sergeant Sather covered countless miles
    conducting specialized reconnaissance in the Southwestern Iraqi desert
    supporting classified missions. With only minimal sleep he assumed a leadership
    role in the reconnaissance of an enemy airfield opening up the first of five
    airheads used by a joint task force to conduct critical resupply of fielded
    troops, and provide attack helicopter rearming facilities enabling deep
    battlefield offensive operations. Sergeant Sather was then employed to an area
    of heavy enemy concentration tasked to provide critical reconnaissance and
    intelligence on enemy movement supporting direct action missions against enemy
    forces. Exposed to direct enemy fire on numerous occasions he continued to
    provide vital information to higher headquarters in direct support of ongoing
    combat operations. His magnificent skills in the control of close air support
    aircraft and keen leadership under great pressure were instrumental in the
    overwhelming success of these dangerous missions. Sergeant Sather's phenomenal

    its initial 2003 invasion phase to a multi-year occupation, United States
    public opinion turned in favor of troop withdrawal. In late April 2007, the
    United States Congress passed a supplementary spending bill for Iraq that set a

    from Operation IRAQI FREEDOM to Operation NEW DAWN, signifying a formal end to
    United States military combat operations. The transition to a supporting role
    and stability operations was made possible by increased capability of Iraqi
    Security Forces and their improved ability to combat terrorists and provide
    security for the Iraqi people. As part of Operation NEW DAWN, United States
    Forces had three primary missions: advising, assisting, and training the Iraqi
    security forces; conducting partnered counterterrorism operations; and
    providing support to provincial reconstruction teams and civilian partners as

    Libyan citizens from further harm from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's regime.
    Following the initial launch of Tomahawk missiles, three United States aircraft

    power and create a viable democratic state. More than a decade into the war,
    NATO forces continued to battle a widespread Taliban insurgency, and the war
    expanded into the tribal area of neighboring Pakistan. On 21 May 2012 the

    <p id="P-846"><span id="SPAN-847">1.19.16. For most United
    States' and NATO forces, the war in Afghanistan was over by the end of 2014. At
    NATO's International Security Assistance Force headquarters in Kabul, a ceremony
    marked the end of International Security Assistance Force's mission and the
    transition to the NATO-led Resolute Support. The new NATO presence would be
    more than 12,500 troops to focus on Afghan security forces stability, and
    United States personnel would number almost 11,000, including approximately
    2,500 Airmen, in January 2015. The United States Operation ENDURING FREEDOM
    would be replaced by Operation FREEDOM's SENTINEL, the name of the United
    States portion of NATO's Resolute Support. Airmen would continue to work at
    standing up the Afghan Air Force, and their mission could continue until the
    Afghan Air Force becomes fully independent.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-848"><span id="SPAN-849">1.19.17. In the latter
    part of 2014, a new and ominous threat emerged that resulted in United States
    Airmen again involved in operations in the skies over Iraq. The enemy, calling
    themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant, was an extremist Sunni
    jihadist organization. Aided by a number of worldwide recruits and
    sympathizers, Islamic State of Iraq and Levant gained control of territory in
    Syria and northern Iraq (including the cities of Mosul and Fallujah) exceeding
    the size of Great Britain, leaving savage atrocities in their wake, including
    mass murders and ruthless executions of innocent civilians. Their brutality
    resulted in nearly universal condemnation even Al Qaeda repudiated them and
    President Obama authorized United States forces, in cooperation with partner
    nations, to conduct carefully targeted air strikes over Syria and Iraq,
    beginning in August, with the aim of degrading and defeating Islamic State of
    Iraq and Levant. This operation, under the name of INHERENT RESOLVE, was still
    ongoing at the end of 2014.</span></p>

    <p id="P-853"><span id="SPAN-854">1.20.1.
    From Kitty Hawk to Afghanistan, the record of air and space power emphasizes
    powerful themes. The interplay of doctrine, technology, tactics, and strategy
    must be sustained by training, logistics, supply, and support infrastructure.
    Although history may not provide hard and fast lessons, it offers inspiration,
    insight, and examples to spur your thinking. Today's Airmen draw from a proud
    heritage of sacrifice, valor, and success. Just as our predecessors triumphed
    over the challenges at St. Mihiel, Schweinfurt, and MiG Alley, you will face
    new challenges with courage, skill, innovation, and perseverance.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-858"><span id="SPAN-859">1.20.2. From the skies
    over the Rio Grande to those over Iraq and Afghanistan nearly 100 years later,
    air power has evolved from an ineffective oddity to the dominant form of
    military might in the world. Its applications and effectiveness have increased
    with each succeeding conflict; in World War I air power played a minor role, in
    Kosovo it played the only role. In addition to their air combat role, airmen
    have bravely and successfully carried out a large number of humanitarian
    missions, demonstrating the ability to save lives and alleviate suffering in
    the face of both natural and manmade disasters. This chapter has looked at the
    development of air power through the nation's many conflicts and contingencies,
    spotlighting just a few of the many contributions of enlisted personnel.</span></p>

    <p id="P-871"><span id="SPAN-872">1.21.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-873">Orville
    and Wilbur Wright.&nbsp;</b>The Wright brothers, bicycle manufacturers from
    Dayton, Ohio, achieved the first powered, sustained, controlled airplane flight
    in 1903, heralding the age of heavier-than-air aviation. Wilbur was born 16
    April 1867, near Millville, Indiana, and Orville was
    born&nbsp; 19 August 1871, in Dayton, Ohio. They became
    interested in mechanical flight after reading about Otto Lilienthal s
    successful glider experiments in Germany during the 1890s. In contrast to other
    experimenters, the Wrights concentrated their efforts on a threedimensional
    system of control, using an elevator and twisting the wings (called warping) in
    combination with a vertical rudder. A series of biplane gliders in 1902 led to
    a development of a perfectly controllable glider capable of generating
    sufficient lift. Subsequently, the brothers designed and built a relatively
    lightweight gasoline engine and revolutionary, highly efficient propellers for
    the 1903 flyer. Using that aircraft, they successfully flew four manned
    missions 17 December 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 1904 and 1905, the
    Wright brothers conducted experiments at Huffman Prairie, near Dayton, and
    introduced a new improved aircraft each year. The 1905 Wright flyer is
    generally recognized as the first practical airplane. It could turn, bank, fly
    figure eights, and remain aloft for over 30 minutes. It was not until 1907 that
    the Signal Corps established an Aviation Section and issued a bid for a
    military airplane. Tests of the Wright military machine began at Fort Myer,
    Virginia, in 1908. A crash 17 September 1908, however, seriously injured
    Orville, killed passenger Lieutenant Thomas E. Selfridge, and temporarily
    interrupted testing. A new machine accepted in the fall of 1909 was the United
    States Army's first airplane: Signal Corps No. 1. Subsequently the Wright
    brothers trained several United States Army pilots, including Henry H.  Hap 
    Arnold, future commander of the United States Army Air Forces during World War
    II. The Wright Aircraft Company sold the Army several airplanes. The Wrights,
    however, remained wedded to the wing warping system of control and their
    airplanes became increasingly inferior and uncompetitive, while those of rivals
    like Glenn Curtiss improved rapidly in performance. Wilbur died of typhoid
    fever 30 May 1912, and Orville later sold the Wright Company and assumed a less
    active role in aviation. He remained, however, the  father  of flying and a
    highly honored individual until his death 30 January 1948.</span></p>

    <p id="P-877"><span id="SPAN-878">1.21.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-879">Colonel William  Billy  Mitchell</b>. Colonel
    Mitchell was an airpower visionary who saw the airplane dominating warfare and
    called for an air force independent of the United States Army.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-880"><span id="SPAN-881">1.21.2.1. Born to
    wealthy American parents in Nice, France, on 29 December 1879, he grew up in
    Wisconsin. He attended Racine College and Columbian College (now George
    Washington University in Washington, District of Columbia) but abandoned
    college at the beginning of the Spanish-American War and enlisted in the
    military. His father, a United States Senator, applied influence and he
    received a commission. Intelligent, able, and aggressive, Mitchell was the
    youngest captain ever selected to join the General Staff (1912).&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-882"><span id="SPAN-883">1.21.2.2. In 1915,
    Mitchell joined the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps and the following year
    he took private flying lessons. During much of 1918, he commanded most of the
    United States air combat units at the front. He added the use of aircraft in
    mass to overwhelm the enemy to the British doctrine of taking the offensive. In
    September 1918, he massed more than 1,500 United States and Allied aircraft in
    support of the St. Mihiel offensive. In April 1921, Mitchell became Assistant
    to the Chief of the Air Service. His outspoken advocacy of a separate air
    force, critical remarks about the poor quality of the Air Service, and
    criticism of superiors caused considerable controversy. Worse was his
    methodology, which relied on appeals to Congress and the public outside the
    chain of command, often in violation of direct orders. His claims that the
    airplane could sink battleships ultimately led to bombing trials in June 1921.
    During these trials, the 1st Provisional Air Brigade under Mitchell s
    leadership sank the former German battleship&nbsp;<i id="I-884">Ostfriesland</i>, which
    was probably the high point of Mitchell's military career.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-885"><span id="SPAN-886">1.21.2.3. Major General
    Mason Patrick, Air Service commander after the bombing trials, was able to keep
    Mitchell out of trouble for a time, but in 1925 further activities led the War
    Department to refuse to reappoint him as Assistant Chief. Mitchell reverted to
    his permanent rank of colonel and was assigned to Fort Sam Houston,
    Texas.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-887"><span id="SPAN-888">1.21.2.4. Even from
    Texas, Mitchell used the press to continue to advocate an independent air
    force. After the Navy dirigible&nbsp;<i id="I-889">Shenandoah</i>&nbsp;was destroyed in a
    storm, he charged senior military leadership with incompetence.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-890"><span id="SPAN-891">President Coolidge
    personally ordered Mitchell's court-martial, and he was found guilty of
    insubordination. Mitchell resigned his commission 1 February 1926 and died 19
    February 1936.</span></p>

    General Benjamin D.  Benny  Foulois</b>. Foulois was a pioneer aviator and the
    first commander of an American air unit in the field. He was born in
    Connecticut, 9 December 1879. He enlisted in the Army at the time of the
    Spanish-American War and was commissioned during his service in the Philippines
    in 1901. In 1907, Foulois entered the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. In
    1908 and 1909, Foulois participated in the acceptance tests of the Army's first
    semirigid dirigible and its first airplane, a Wright flyer designated Signal
    Corps No. 1. In 1910, Foulois took Signal Corps No. 1 to Fort Sam Houston,
    Texas, where he conducted tests to demonstrate its military usefulness. He
    remained in aviation until his retirement in 1935. In subsequent years, Foulois
    participated in all aspects of early United States Army aviation and in 1915,
    completed the organization of the Army's first operational unit, the 1st Aero
    Squadron. Foulois commanded the squadron during the Mexican Punitive Expedition
    in 1916-1917; the first deployment of a United States Army air unit to the
    field. Following the Punitive Expedition, Foulois went to Washington, District
    of Columbia, where he played a major role in planning and implementing the $640
    million aviation program begun after the United States entered World War I.
    Foulois was promoted to brigadier general and named Chief of the Air Service
    for the American Expeditionary Force in November 1917.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-898"><span id="SPAN-899">1.21.3.1. He was
    unsuccessful, however, and was replaced by General Patrick in May 1918.
    Foulois' subsequent work, especially as Patrick's assistant, however, played a
    major role in Air Service success during the war.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-900"><span id="SPAN-901">1.21.3.2. In 1927, he
    moved to Washington, District of Columbia, to become Assistant Chief of the Air
    Service, and in 1931 was promoted to major general and named Chief of the Air
    Corps. Foulois proved a less-thaneffective Air Corps leader. A hands-on
    individual, he tried to spend more time in the cockpit and less in the office.
    A firm advocate of strategic bombardment and an independent air force, his
    testimony before Congress was usually blunt and straightforward.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-902"><span id="SPAN-903">1.21.3.3. In 1934,
    Foulois agreed on short notice that the Air Corps could fly the United States
    mail. The service proved ill-equipped for the effort, which damaged Foulois 
    reputation. However, during his tenure, the Air Corps acquired its first B-17
    heavy bombers and he helped organize General Headquarters Air Force in 1935; a
    significant step toward Air Force independence. General Foulois retired 31
    December 1935 and died 25 April 1967.</span></p>

    of the Air Force Henry H.  Hap  Arnold</b>. General Arnold was an aviation
    pioneer and is generally recognized as the father of the modern United States
    Air Force, commanding the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.
    Arnold was born in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, 25 June 1886, and graduated from
    West Point in 1907. Originally an infantryman, he became a flyer in 1911. His
    career paralleled the early development of United States military aviation. In
    April 1911, the Signal Corps sent Arnold to Dayton, Ohio, where Wilbur and
    Orville Wright taught him to fly. In 1912, he won the first Mackay Trophy for
    making the most meritorious military flight of the year.&nbsp;<i id="I-910">Promoted</i>&nbsp;to
    temporary colonel, Arnold spent most of World War I as the highest-ranking
    flying officer in Washington, District of Columbia. He would apply the lessons
    he learned during the Great War to the development of the United States Army
    Air Forces. Arnold began his rise to command of the Army Air Corps during the
    interwar years, serving in Air Service headquarters in Washington, District of
    Columbia, and in several of the most important operational flying commands in
    the field. Promotion to lieutenant colonel came in 1931 and with it command of
    March Field, California. In 1934, he took command of the western zone of the
    United States.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-911"><span id="SPAN-912">1.21.4.1. In 1934,
    Arnold again won the Mackay Trophy, leading a flight of 10 B-10 bombers from Washington,
    District of Columbia, to Fairbanks, Alaska. On 29 September 1938, he was named
    Chief of the Air Corps. On 30 June 1941, he became Commanding General of the
    United States Army Air Forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-913"><span id="SPAN-914">1.21.4.2. General Arnold

    expanded from 22,000 members and 3,900 aircraft to nearly 2.5 million members
    and 75,000 aircraft. Throughout the war he remained committed to strategic
    bombardment, laying the foundation for a post-war independent air force. He
    directly commanded the 20th Air Force B-29s during their 1944 and 1945 assault
    on Japan. Supervising the air war on a global scale proved a strenuous task.
    Arnold had a severe heart attack that led to his 30 June 1946 retirement.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-917"><span id="SPAN-918">1.21.4.3. On 7 May 1949,

    States Air Force, was born 28 June 1891, in Boyertown, Pennsylvania. He
    graduated from West Point in 1914, entered the Aviation Section of the Signal
    Corps in October 1915, and earned his wings in 1916. During World War I, Spaatz
    served in France. He flew in combat for only three weeks but still shot down
    three German planes. General Spaatz was one of the pioneering aviators of the
    interwar years. For nearly a week, 1-7 January 1929, Spaatz and several other
    officers kept the Question Mark, a Fokker trimotor, aloft over California.
    During the 151-hour flight, the Question Mark refueled in the air 37 times,
    nine of those after dark. In June 1933, he was assigned to Washington, District
    of Columbia, as Chief of the Air Corps Training and Operations Division. While
    attending the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in
    September 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 1936, Spaatz was assigned
    as the executive officer, 2d Bomb Wing, Langley Field, Virginia. He returned to
    Washington in 1939 to serve as Assistant Executive Officer to the Chief of the
    Air Corps. In November 1939, he was promoted to colonel and transferred to
    England to serve as a military observer. In October 1940, Spaatz returned to
    Washington to accept a promotion to brigadier general and an assignment as
    Assistant to the Chief of the Air Corps.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-925"><span id="SPAN-926">1.21.5.1. After the war
    began, Spaatz advanced rapidly through a succession of jobs. He commanded
    Eighth Air Force before accepting command of the Northwest African Air Forces.
    On 6 January 1944, he assumed command of United States Strategic Air Forces in
    Europe, tasked with softening up Hitler's Fortress Europe, before the Allied invasion.
    General Spaatz pinned on his fourth star in March 1945, prior to assuming
    command of United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific Theater. He
    oversaw the final strategic bombing campaign against Japan, including the 1945
    use of atomic weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-927"><span id="SPAN-928">1.21.5.2. In February

    most promising Army Air Forces generals. Born in Nashville, Tennessee, 3
    February 1884, he graduated from West Point in 1906 and entered the cavalry. He
    served at several posts, from the Philippines to Vermont, before joining the
    Aviation Division in August 1917, serving in the Office of the Chief Signal
    Officer. In 1918, he was assigned to the Army General Staff Plans Division. He
    was assigned to Germany in August 1920, where he served for three years in
    public relations and civil affairs. Andrews returned to Kelly Field, Texas, in
    1923, to serve as executive officer and, eventually, Commandant of Flying.
    After attending the Air Corps Tactical School, he was assigned to 2d Wing
    Headquarters, Langley Field, Virginia, as a staff officer. Andrews completed
    the Army War College in May 1933, and subsequently, became Commander, 1st

    colonel, he accepted command of the 20th Pursuit Group at Hamilton Field,
    California. In January 1942, shortly after the United States entered World War
    II, Eaker took command of the VIII Bomber Command and was promoted to brigadier
    general. A strong advocate of daylight strategic bombardment, he convinced
    Prime Minister Winston Churchill that it had merit. Eaker directed the daylight

    of the first stewardesses hired by United Airlines when the United States
    entered World War II. She was later accepted into the Army Air Forces and by
    the summer of 1943, she was in England pulling wounded and frostbitten crewmen
    out of B-17s returning from bombing raids over Europe. D-Day, 6 June 1944,

    <p id="P-985"><span id="SPAN-986">1.21.10.2. His Army Air
    Corps experiences enabled him to command air forces with such success during
    World War II. He was the quintessential Air Corps officer in the sense that his
    experience encompassed a broad range of functions, from maintenance, supply,
    and production to strategy, tactics, and operations. He gained a reputation as
    a technical and tactical innovator.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-987"><span id="SPAN-988">1.21.10.3. During World
    War II, as commander of the Southwest Pacific Area Allied Air Forces and the

    of authority, instituted new supply and maintenance programs, commanded with
    authority, and earned the respect and admiration of his men. Perhaps the most
    daring and innovative commander of the war, Kenney gained MacArthur s
    confidence because he knew how to run combat air forces and produced results
    quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-989"><span id="SPAN-990">1.21.10.4. Toward the

    wrote:  Of all the commanders of our major Air Forces engaged in World War II,
    none surpassed General Kenney in those three great essentials of successful
    combat leadership - aggressive vision, mastery over air strategy and tactics,
    and the ability to exact the maximum in fighting quality from both men and

    businessman, commanding general, oil company executive, special assistant to
    the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, and holder of the Medal of
    Honor. Doolittle was born 14 December 1896, in Alameda, California. After a
    year at the California School of Mines, he joined the Signal Corps Reserve in
    1917 and earned his wings in 1918. Over the next 4 years he accepted a variety
    of assignments in the Signal Corps aviation section, demonstrating exceptional
    ability as a pilot and as a daredevil. He also continued his education, earning
    a bachelor's degree from the University of California in 1922, a master s
    degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1924, and a Ph.D. from
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1925.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Schneider Trophy Races, setting a seaplane speed record of</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-999"><span id="SPAN-1000">245.713 mph. He helped
    develop fog-flying equipment in 1928, which led to widespread use of the
    artificial horizontal and directional gyroscopes. He made the first  blind

    1942 B-25 raid on Tokyo, launched from the deck of the aircraft carrier Hornet.
    Though all 16 aircraft were lost, the raid restored American morale and damaged
    Japanese confidence. It also earned Doolittle the Medal of Honor and promotion

    University before joining the United States Army.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1018"><span id="SPAN-1019">1.21.12.1. Chennault was
    commissioned a first lieutenant in November 1917 and earned his wings at Kelly
    Field, Texas, in 1919. During the 1920s, Chennault earned a reputation as a
    talented  stick and rudder man  and an absolute master of pursuit (fighter)
    tactics. As a captain, Chennault graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School
    in 1931, then remained at the school as an instructor, eventually becoming head
    of the Pursuit Section. During the 1930s, such Air Corps Tactical School
    instructors as Harold George, Robert Olds, and Kenneth Walker developed
    doctrine advocating high altitude, daylight, precision bombing of key enemy
    industrial and military targets using heavy bombers. In contrast, Chennault
    stressed the importance of pursuit aviation, and advocated a system of air
    defense based upon early warning of an enemy attack. Technology in the 1930s
    was not in Chennault's favor. Bombers like the B-10 and B-17 became larger and
    faster, and pursuers fell increasingly behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-1020"><span id="SPAN-1021">1.21.12.2. Forced to

    <p id="P-1022"><span id="SPAN-1023">1.21.12.3. In 1941,
    Chennault recruited American military pilots and organized the American
    Volunteer Group under a carefully hidden Roosevelt Administration program to
    provide an air force for Chinese leader Chiang Kaishek. Chennault trained three
    squadrons of  Flying Tigers' in tactics he had developed that took advantage of
    the strengths of his Curtiss P-40s and exploited enemy weaknesses.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1024"><span id="SPAN-1025">1.21.12.4. Though the
    American Volunteer Group did not enter combat until after Pearl Harbor, the
    unit gained fame for its victorious exploits during the first six months of
    World War II. In April 1942, the United States Army Air Forces recalled Chennault
    to active duty, in the grade of major general, to command Fourteenth Air Force
    in China. In that capacity, he fought two wars: one against the Japanese and
    another against supply and equipment problems in isolated China.&nbsp;</span></p>

    flew pursuit planes until 1937, when he transferred to the 2d Bomb Group, Langley
    Field, Virginia. There, he earned a reputation as an outstanding pilot and
    exceptional navigator. Accordingly, in late 1937 and early 1938, he served as
    lead navigator for two mass flights of B-17s to South America.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1036"><span id="SPAN-1037">1.21.13.2. LeMay was

    command of the 305th Bombardment Group at Muroc, California. Later that year,
    his group joined the Eighth Air Force in England. LeMay's no-nonsense approach
    to combat earned him his first and second stars in September 1943 and March
    1944. In August 1944, he assumed command of the XX Bomber Command in the
    Pacific. His B-29s were charged with destroying Japan's war-making potential.
    After the war, LeMay served at the Pentagon before his promotion and assignment
    as Commander, United States Forces in Europe, in October 1947. His success at
    directing the Berlin Airlift in 1948 made him the obvious choice for Strategic

    Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1906. After graduating from the United States
    Military Academy in 1928, he entered the Air Corps and during the 1930s earned
    a reputation as an excellent pilot and hardworking intelligence officer. During
    World War II, Tunner helped create the United States Army Air Forces Ferrying
    Command. By the time it became Air Transport Command, it was delivering 10,000
    aircraft monthly from stateside factories to worldwide theaters of
    operation.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1048"><span id="SPAN-1049">1.21.14.1. In 1944,
    Tunner assumed command of the  Hump  airlift operation, supplying China from
    India over some of the world's highest mountain ranges. The often appalling
    terrain and weather, equipment, facilities, and aircraft shortages made the
     Hump  a difficult operation. Tunner refined and standardized every element of
    the operation, implementing assembly-line maintenance, systemizing
    cargo-handling procedures, emphasizing flight safety, and imbuing the operation
    with a driving</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1050"><span id="SPAN-1051">commitment to increase
    tonnage. In July 1945 alone, Air Transport Command delivered 71,042 tons of
    cargo. In June 1948, Air Transport Command and the Naval Air Transport Service
    merged, becoming the Military Air Transport Service, and Tunner assumed command
    of its Atlantic Division&nbsp;</span></p>

    1948, the Soviet Union blockaded the surface routes between Berlin and the
    Western occupation zones in Germany. Allied leaders ordered an airlift to
    supply Berlin, 26 June. On 28 July, Tunner assumed command of the airlift,
    Operation VITTLES. Tunner developed an intricate bridge of aircraft that flowed
    in a steady stream through narrow corridors in and out of Berlin. Before the
    Soviet Union lifted the blockade 12 May 1949, Operation VITTLES delivered 2.3
    million tons of cargo to Berlin. Under Tunner, the Berlin Airlift emerged as an
    epic enterprise, demonstrating the peaceful use of airpower as a political
    instrument.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1054"><span id="SPAN-1055">1.21.14.3. When the
    Korean War broke out in June 1950, General Tunner took command of Combat Cargo
    Command (Provisional). Tunner illustrated how a fleet of cargo aircraft was
    sufficiently flexible to handle airborne assault while airdropping supplies,
    and moving cargo and personnel through a combat theater. In the mid-1950s,
    Tunner commanded United States Air Forces in Europe.&nbsp;</span></p>

    whose muzzle flashes were visible outside the United States Army Depot at Long
    Binh. The aircraft, an armed version of the C-47 Skytrain transport, had been
    flying a night mission in the Tan Son Nhut air base area when Long Binh came
    under attack.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1182"><span id="SPAN-1183">1.21.20.3. Suddenly,

    of light. A North Vietnamese Army 82-millimeter mortar shell had landed on top
    of the right wing and exploded inside the wing frame. The blast raked the
    fuselage with flying shrapnel. Everyone in the back of Spooky 71 was wounded.
    Despite his wounds, Levitow rescued a fellow crewmember who was perilously
    close to the open cargo door. As he dragged his buddy toward the center of the
    cabin, Levitow saw a loose, burning 27-pound magnesium flare rolling amid
    ammunition cans that contained 19,000 live rounds.&nbsp;</span></p>

    it to pick it up. He threw himself on the burning flare, hugging it to his
    body, and dragged himself to the rear of the aircraft, leaving a trail of blood
    behind. He hurled it through the open cargo door, and at that instant, the
    flare separated and ignited in the air, fortunately clear of the aircraft. When
    the aircraft returned to the base, the extent of the danger was apparent: The
    AC-47 had more than 3,500 holes in the wings and fuselage, one measuring more
    than three feet long. Levitow spent 2 1/2 months in a hospital and upon his
    recovery, returned to Vietnam for another tour. He returned to the United

    the Viet Cong. Pitsenbarger was killed by Viet Cong snipers later that night.
    When his body was recovered the next day, one hand still held a rifle and the
    other clutched a medical kit.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Alice, accepted the Medal of Honor from Secretary of the Air Force Whit Peters.
    The audience included battle survivors, hundreds of pararescue airmen, a

    Eileen M. Collins</b>. Colonel Collins was the first woman to command a space
    shuttle mission. An Air Force officer and National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration astronaut, Colonel Collins was born 19 November 1956, in Elmira,
    New York. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics and economics at
    Syracuse University in 1978; a master of science degree in operations research
    from Stanford University in 1986; and a master of arts degree in space systems
    management from Webster University in 1989. Collins graduated from Air Force
    Undergraduate Pilot Training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma, in 1979, served
    as a T-38 instructor pilot at Vance, and in 1983 became a C-141 aircraft
    commander and instructor pilot at Travis Air Force Base, California. From 1986
    to 1989, she was an assistant professor of mathematics and a T-41 instructor
    pilot at the United States Air Force Academy. By the time she retired from the
    Air Force in 2005, Colonel Collins logged more than 6,750 hours in 30 different
    types of aircraft.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-1215"><span id="SPAN-1216">1.21.22.1. In January
    1990, National Aeronautics and Space Administration selected Colonel Collins
    for the astronaut program while she was attending the Air Force Test Pilot
    School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. She became an astronaut in July
    1991, initially assigned to orbiter engineering support. She served on the
    astronaut support team responsible for orbiter prelaunch checkout, final launch
    configuration, crew ingress/egress, and landing/recovery, and also worked as a
    mission control spacecraft communicator. She also served as the astronaut
    office spacecraft systems branch chief, chief information officer, shuttle
    branch chief, and astronaut safety branch chief.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1217"><span id="SPAN-1218">1.21.22.2. A veteran of
    four space flights, Collins logged over 872 hours in space. STS-63 was the
    first flight of the new joint Russian-American Space Program. Mission
    highlights included the rendezvous with the Russian Space Station Mir, an
    astronomy shuttle deployment and retrieval, and a space-walk. On this mission,
    Colonel Collins became the first female pilot of a space shuttle.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1219"><span id="SPAN-1220">1.21.22.3. She flew on
    STS-84 aboard the Atlantis 15-24 May 1997. It was National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration's sixth Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the
    Russian Space Station Mir. During the flight, the crew transferred nearly four
    tons of supplies and experimental equipment.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1221"><span id="SPAN-1222">1.21.22.4. During
    STS-93, flown by the Columbia, 22-27 July 1999, she became the first woman to
    command a shuttle mission. This mission featured deployment of the Chandra
    X-Ray Observatory.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1223"><span id="SPAN-1224">1.21.22.5. STS -114
    Discovery, 26 July-9 August 2005, was the return to flight mission during which
    the shuttle docked with the International Space Station and the crew tested and
    evaluated new procedures for flight safety and shuttle inspection and repair
    techniques. After a two-week, 5.8 million-mile-journey in space, the orbiter
    and its seven-astronaut crew returned, landing at Edwards Air Force Base,
    California.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Airman Jason D. Cunningham</b>. Born 27 March 1975, Senior Airman Cunningham
    earned the Air Force Cross for extraordinary heroism in military operations,
    presented posthumously by the President of the United States, against an
    opposing armed force while serving as a pararescueman near the village of
    Marzak, Paktia Province, Afghanistan,&nbsp;4 March 2002.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1233"><span id="SPAN-1234">1.21.23.1. That day, Senior
    Airman Cunningham was the primary Air Force combat search and rescue medic
    assigned to a quick reaction force that had been tasked to rescue two American
    servicemen from austere terrain occupied by Al Qaeda and Taliban forces.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1235"><span id="SPAN-1236">1.21.23.2. Shortly before
    landing, his MH-47E helicopter took rocket-propelled grenade and small arms
    fire, severely disabling the aircraft. The assault force formed a hasty defense
    and immediately suffered three fatalities and five critical casualties.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1237"><span id="SPAN-1238">1.21.23.3. Facing enemy
    fire, risking his own life, Senior Airman Cunningham remained in the burning
    fuselage in order to treat the wounded. He moved his patients to a more secure
    location under mortar attack, disregarding the extreme danger, exposing himself
    to enemy fire on seven separate occasions.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1239"><span id="SPAN-1240">1.21.23.4. When the
    second casualty collection point was also compromised, Senior Airman Cunningham
    braved intense small arms and rocket-propelled grenade attack to reposition the
    wounded to a third collection point. Mortally wounded and quickly fading, he
    continued to direct patient movement, transferring care to another medic. His
    selfless efforts resulted to the delivery of ten gravely wounded Americans to
    life-saving medical treatment.</span></p>

    Master Sergeant Richard L. Etchberger</b>. Born in 1933, Richard Loy  Dick 
    Etchberger grew up in Pennsylvania, joining the Air Force in 1951. After
    completing basic training, he attended a technical school at Keesler Air Force
    Base, Mississippi, studying electronics, which would launch his career in radar
    bomb scoring. One of the Air Force's most highly trained radar technicians, he
    volunteered for a highly classified mission at Lima Site 85 in Laos. He was the
    crew chief of a radar team there when North Vietnamese forces overran his radar
    site 11 March 1968. Under heavy fire, he continued to defend his comrades,
    called in air strikes, and directed an air evacuation. When a rescue helicopter
    arrived, the chief put himself in the line of fire to load three other Airmen
    in rescue slings. He was fatally wounded by enemy ground fire as he was being
    rescued. His fierce defense prevented the enemy from closing on his position,
    which saved his comrades lives, although he lost his own. For extraordinary
    heroism and superb leadership, Chief Etchberger was posthumously awarded the
    Air Force Cross, but the award remained a secret for two decades. He was
    awarded the Medal of Honor on 21 September 2010, the first E-9 to receive this
    award.</span></p>

    <p id="P-1873"><span id="SPAN-1874">This chapter documents the
    lives and activities of Airmen so you, the reader, will gain an understanding
    of what it means to be an Airman. From Kitty Hawk to Afghanistan 108 years
    later, the United States Air Force has grown into the finest Air Force in the
    world. You can take pride in the efforts and accomplishments of enlisted
    pioneers of the United States Air Force and its predecessor organizations who,
    through their own sacrifices, made the Air Force enlisted corps what it is
    today. Without their many contributions, none of that would have been possible.</span></p>

    <p id="P-1891"><span id="SPAN-1892">The history of the Air
    Force enlisted corps is long and varied. The United States Air Force traces
    their origin to the establishment of the Aeronautical Division, created on 1
    August 1907. The Army, however, first used  aerial devices' for military
    purposes during the American Civil War, when President Lincoln created an
    unofficial balloon section. From Benjamin Franklin to the second Seminole War
    in 1840 to the war with Mexico in 1846, the Army has been interested in using
    balloons for military purposes but never did. Consequently, enlisted support
    for United States military aviation began with Civil War balloon operations.
    This chapter examines how enlisted participation in the many wars and conflicts
    throughout our history helped develop the United States Air Force into the
    greatest Air Force in the World. Enlisted Airmen historically comprised some 80</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1893"><span id="SPAN-1894">percent of America's air
    forces. From humble beginnings to today's great United States Air Force, the
    enlisted corps deserves much of the credit for their development and great
    accomplishments. Finally, the purpose for including this chapter within AFH
    1,&nbsp;<i id="I-1895">Airman</i>&nbsp;is to provide enlisted Airmen reference material to
    support their promotion tests.</span></p>

    <p id="P-1906"><span id="SPAN-1907">2.2.1.</span><span id="SPAN-1908">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1909">When the first shots of the Great War were fired in Europe in
    August 1914, the 1st Aero Squadron mustered a dozen officers, 54 enlisted men,
    and 6 aircraft. By the end of 1915, the squadron counted 44 officers, 224
    enlisted men, and 23 airplanes. This constituted the entire air arm of the
    United States Armed Forces.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1910"><span id="SPAN-1911">2.2.2.</span><span id="SPAN-1912">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1913">By 1916, a second aero squadron was added, assigned to duty in the
    Philippine Islands, and new training facilities were added. In October 1916,
    plans were laid for 24 squadrons: 7 to serve with the regular Army, 12 with the
    National Guard, and 5 for coastal defense, supplementing balloon units for the
    field and coast artillery. Each squadron was to muster a dozen aircraft. The
    regular Army squadrons were either organized or in the process of being
    organized by the end of 1916, and all 24 squadrons were formed by early 1917,
    but only the 1st Aero Squadron was fully equipped, manned, and organized when
    the United States declared war on Germany 6 April 1917.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1914"><span id="SPAN-1915">2.2.3.</span><span id="SPAN-1916">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1917">By April 1917, the United States Army Aviation Section consisted
    of 131 officers (virtually all pilots or pilots-intraining), 1,087 enlisted
    men, and had fewer than 250 airplanes. Even as the war in Europe dragged on,
    the United States Congress refused to appropriate significant funds for Army
    aeronautics. The Army's poor state of preparedness could not be laid entirely
    at Congress' feet. The Army had no plan to enable them to build an air force
    and did not send trained observers to Europe. General staff officers were so
    out of touch with modern aerial warfare requirements that their chief complaint
    about air personnel was the disrespectful manner in which flying officers
    flouted regulations by refusing to wear their cavalry spurs while flying
    airplanes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1918"><span id="SPAN-1919">2.2.4.</span><span id="SPAN-1920">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1921">Tradition dictated that pilots be drawn from the ranks of
    commissioned officers, but the Aviation Section soon realized the pressing need
    for trained enlisted personnel to perform duties in supply and construction and
    to serve specialized functions in the emerging aviation-related fields of photo
    reconnaissance and radio. Most of all, the Aviation Section needed mechanics. The
    war demanded engine mechanics, armament specialists, welders, riggers, and sail
    makers. The Army first pressed factories into service as training sites, but by
    the end of 1917, the Aviation Section began training mechanics and others at a
    number of special schools and technical institutions. The two largest were in
    St Paul Minnesota and at Kelly Field Texas. Later, mechanics and other enlisted
    specialists were also trained at fields and factories in Great Britain and
    France.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1922"><span id="SPAN-1923">2.2.5.</span><span id="SPAN-1924">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1925">In addition to the specialized roles directly associated with
    flying, Air Service enlisted personnel performed a wide variety of
    administration, mess, transport, and medical corps support functions.
    Construction personnel, who built the airfields, hangars, barracks, and other
    buildings, were often the first enlisted men stationed at various overseas
    locations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1926"><b id="B-1927"><span id="SPAN-1928">2.3. Milestones of World War II (1939-1945).</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-1929"><span id="SPAN-1930">Even before the outbreak
    of hostilities in Europe, the General Headquarters Air Force had begun a
    massive expansion program that would balloon during the following years into
    the largest air organization in the nation's history. In 1939, President
    Franklin D. Roosevelt asked for $300 million for military aviation. The Air
    Corps planned to have 24 operational combat-ready groups by 1941 which would
    require greatly enhanced manpower, training, and equipment.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1931"><span id="SPAN-1932">2.3.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-1933">The Air Corps Prepares for War:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1934"><span id="SPAN-1935">2.3.1.1.</span><span id="SPAN-1936">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1937">In 1938, when the United States first took seriously the signs of
    war in Europe, the Army's air arm was still under two cumbersome command
    organizations: the Army Air Corps and General Headquarters Air Force. The total
    force included less than 20,000 enlisted members. In 1940, Congress passed the
    first peacetime conscription law in United States history. By March 1944 when
    Air Force manpower reached their high point, 2,104,405 enlisted men and women
    were serving in a virtually independent branch of the armed services. Moreover,
    they operated a sophisticated machine of air war that covered nearly the entire
    globe.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1938"><span id="SPAN-1939">2.3.1.2.</span><span id="SPAN-1940">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1941">From 1939 until 1941, the concept of training did not change
    drastically, but the scale did. Training centers expanded and multiplied. Ever
    larger numbers of new Airmen passed through advanced training as the overall
    goals for assembling combat-ready groups increased. The air corps simply could
    not build housing fast enough or find qualified instructors in sufficient
    numbers to keep up with the pace. Army officials turned to private schools to
    help meet the demand, and many mechanics, for example, received training in one
    of the 15 civilian schools.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1942"><span id="SPAN-1943">2.3.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-1944">World War II - The Great Central,

    <p id="P-1945"><span id="SPAN-1946">2.3.2.1.</span><span id="SPAN-1947">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1948">More than 2 million enlisted Airmen served in the United States
    Army Air Forces during the largest war ever. Most of them aside from a small
    number of prewar soldiers were not professional warriors. Some carried out
    routine duties in safe if unfamiliar surroundings, while others endured extreme
    conditions in faraway places for years. Tens of thousands died in combat, and
    scarcely any remained unchanged by the war.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1949"><span id="SPAN-1950">2.3.2.2.</span><span id="SPAN-1951">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1952">Before the United States could engage the enemy, they needed more
    personnel, training, and equipment. Thus, 1942 was a year of buildup and
    training; processes that continued throughout the war. According to one former
    8th Air Force gunner,  It took an average of about 30 men to support a
    bomber I m talking about a fourengine bomber, whether a B-24 or a B-17, they
    are about the same thing yet you had to have somebody riding a gasoline truck,
    oil trucks; you had to have a carburetor specialist and armaments and so forth,
    sheet metal work; if you got shot up, they had to patch the holes. These people
    were very important and they worked 18 to 20 hours a day when you came back. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1953"><span id="SPAN-1954">2.3.2.3.</span><span id="SPAN-1955">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1956">If anything, the gunner underestimated the number of guys on the
    ground required to keep planes in the air. No accurate figure exists across the
    board for World War II, but taking into account all the support personnel in
    the Army Air Corps, the ratio was probably closer to 70 men to 1 airplane.
    During the war, the great majority of the more than 2 million enlisted Airmen
    served in roles that never took them into the air, but without their efforts,
    even the most mundane or menial, no bombs would have dropped and no war would
    have been waged.</span></p>

    combat and other vital duties. The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps was created in
    May 1942 (Figure 2.1). Top priority for assignment of Women's Army Auxiliary
    Corps was to serve at aircraft warning service stations. In the spring of 1943,
    the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps became the Women's Army Corps. Almost half of
    their peak strength served with the United States Army Air Forces with many
    assigned to clerical and administrative duties, while others worked as
    topographers, medical specialists, chemists, and even aircraft mechanics. Some
    commanders were reluctant to accept women into their units, but by mid-1943,
    the demand for them far exceeded the numbers available.</span></p>

    policies were transferred, but the new organization confronted special
    difficulties in maintaining the separation, especially in the case of enlisted
    Airmen. Official restrictions that forced black Airmen to serve either in
    allblack units or in segregated service squads robbed the Air Force of a major
    talent pool. On 11 May 1949, Air Force Letter 35.3 was published, mandating
    that black Airmen be screened for reassignment to formerly all-white units
    according to qualifications. Astoundingly, within a year, virtually the entire
    Air Force was integrated, with few incidents.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-1981"><span id="SPAN-1982">2.3.2.6.</span><span id="SPAN-1983">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-1984">In the spring of 1945, after 3   years of
    carnage, the end of the war seemed inevitable. The 1944 invasion of Europe and
    Allied ground forces' grinding advance toward Berlin finally destroyed Germany.
    The Third Reich surrendered in May 1945. With Europe calmed, American forces
    turned their attention to Japan. The American high command expected the final
    struggle in the Pacific would require relentless attacks against a fanatical
    foe. Despite widespread destruction of Japanese cities by low-level B-29 fire
    bombings throughout the spring and summer of 1945, Japan continued to resist.
    United States commanders realized that only an American invasion of the
    Japanese islands and subjugation of the Japanese would force the empire to
    surrender unconditionally, as the Allies demanded.</span></p>

    foundation for what would become the United Nations. In 1946, the fledgling
    United Nations took up the issue of controlling nuclear weapons. By June 1946,
    a United Nations-appointed commission completed a plan for the elimination of
    nuclear weaponry based on inspectors who would travel the globe to ensure no
    country was making atomic bombs, and to supervise the dismantling of existing
    weapons. Unfortunately, the plan was vetoed by the Soviet Union, resulting in

    closing off all surface access to the city of Berlin. If left unchallenged, the
    provocative actions of the communists may not only have won them an important
    psychological victory, but may also have given them permanent control over all

    William Tunner, who led the Hump airlift over the Himalayan Mountains to supply
    China during World War II. As the nation's leading military air cargo expert,

    a close, 58,000 Airmen served in the country. Airmen performed various duties,

    example, built revetments, barracks, and other facilities. Rapid engineering
    and heavy operational repair squadron, engineering (REDHORSE) teams provided
    more long-range civil engineer services. In the realm of combat operations, Air
    Force gunners flew aboard gunships as well as B-57s and B-52s. In December
    1972, B-52 tail gunner Staff Sergeant Samuel Turner shot down an enemy MiG, the
    first of only two confirmed shoot-downs by enlisted Airmen during the war. Both

    effort to maintain the United States role as advisory only. On 22 November
    1963, embroiled in a deteriorating situation in Vietnam, President Kennedy was
    assassinated and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took office. After the Gulf
    of Tonkin incident and the Senate resolution of 1964, the advisory role rapidly
    evolved into one of combat operations. Yet the Air Force never stopped working
    with the Vietnamese Air Force to develop an ability to prosecute the war
    itself. In January 1969, shortly after taking office, President Nixon announced
    an end to United States combat in Southeast Asia as a primary goal of his
    administration. He charged the Secretary of Defense with making Vietnamization

    Vietnam began in earnest, while air support units lingered. In 1972, taking
    advantage of reduced American ground presence, Communist forces of the National

    early domestic humanitarian flights were flown in response to winter
    emergencies. In March 1923, Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland sent airplanes to

    12 miles from the capital of St. George s, located on the opposite side of the

    repeatedly, showing more versatility and accuracy than naval bombardment and
    land artillery. Several Air Force enlisted personnel were among 10 Air Force
    Grenada veterans cited for special achievement who received special praise for their
    efforts. Among them, Sergeant Charles Tisby, a loadmaster, saved the life of an
    unidentified paratrooper in his aircraft. When his C-130 banked sharply to
    avoid antiaircraft fire, one paratrooper's static line fouled and left the
    trooper still attached to the aircraft. Tisby, with the help of paratroopers
    still on board, managed at significant personal risk to haul the man back in.</span></p>

    a group of junior military officers led by Muammar Qadhafi overthrew the
    pro-Western Libyan Arab monarchy. By the mid-1980s, Libya was one of the
    leading sponsors of worldwide terrorism. In addition to subversion or direct
    military intervention against other African nations and global assassinations
    of anti-Qadhafi Libyan exiles and other  state enemies,  Qadhafi sponsored
    terrorist training camps within Libya and supplied funds, weapons, logistical

    January 1981 and April 1986, terrorists worldwide killed over 300 Americans and
    injured hundreds more. With National Security Decision Directive 138 signed on
    3 April 1984, President Reagan established in principle a United States policy
    of preemptive and retaliatory strikes against terrorists. On27 December 1985,
    terrorists attacked passengers in the Rome and Vienna airports. Despite the
    strong evidence that connected Libya to the incident, the United States
    administration determined they did not have sufficient proof to order
    retaliatory strikes against Libya. President Reagan imposed sanctions against
    Libya, publicly denounced Qadhafi for sponsoring the operation, and sent the
    6th Fleet to exercise off the coast of Libya.</span></p>

    States service members. This time President Reagan had the evidence he sought.
    On 9 April, he authorized an air strike against Libya and attempted to obtain
    support from European allies. Great Britain gave permission for the United
    States Air Force to use British bases; however, the governments of France and
    Spain denied permission to fly over their countries, thereby increasing the Air

    the raid against the terrorist state was extremely popular in the United States

    allies who feared that the raid would spawn more violence. The operation spurred
    Western European governments to increase their defenses against terrorism and
    their intelligence agencies began to share information. The Air Force was
    saddened by the loss of an F-111F crew, but the loss of one out of over a 100
    aircraft used in the raid statistically was not a high toll. Despite the high
    abort rate, collateral damage, and loss of innocent lives after a flight of
    more than 6 hours and in the face of strong enemy opposition the Air Force
    successfully hit three targets previously seen only in photographs.</span></p>

    built a 40-mile long canal to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
    President Woodrow Wilson formally opened the canal on 12 July 1915. Political
    and domestic conditions in Panama remained stable until 1968, when a military

    Noriega maintained ties with the United States intelligence community,

    while at the same time engaging in such activities. By 1987, brutal repression
    of his people was enough for the United States Senate to issue a resolution
    calling for the Panamanians to oust him. Noriega in turn ordered an attack on
    the United States Embassy, causing an end to United States military and
    economic aid. In 1988, a Miami federal grand jury indicted Noriega on
    drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. Noriega intensified his

    of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. During his occupation of the country, he plundered
    it and brutalized the population. The invasion put Iraq, with the fourth
    largest Army in the world and an extensive program to develop nuclear weapons,
    on the doorstep of Saudi Arabia with vast petroleum reserves. If the Saudis

    deterring Saddam Hussein from aggression against the Saudis and then to prepare

    distance toward a unified conventional warfighting capability. The defensive
    deployment in itself was an impressive accomplishment. On 8 August 1990, 24
    F-15Cs landed in Saudi Arabia after taking off 15 hours earlier from Langley
    Air Force Base Virginia, some 8,000 miles away. Within 5 days, C-5 and C-141
    airlifters had escorted in five fighter squadrons, an airborne warning and
    control system contingent, and an airborne brigade: 301 planes altogether. On
    21 August, Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney announced that sufficient force
    was in place to defend Saudi Arabia. A month into the crisis, 1,220 Allied
    aircraft were in theater and combat ready. When Saddam Hussein missed the final

Air Force historian Dr. Richard Hallion
    said,  From the suppliers to the line crews sweating under the desert sun, the
    coalition's maintainers worked miracles, enabling ever-higher sortie rates as
    the war progressed essentially, a constant surge.  Not all enlisted Airmen
    worked on maintenance crews. In addition to traditional enlisted functions,
    there were new duties, some of which were quite high tech. Two less known jobs
    were electronic emissions collection and analysis, undertaken with electronic
    warfare officers and airborne intelligence technicians. Electronic intelligence
    was characterized by long hours of work on station and meticulous, patient
    review of enemy transmissions, shot through with brief but urgently explosive
    moments when life or death information was quickly transmitted to the right
    people.</span></p>

    the land invasion took center stage, Iraq surrendered to the coalition. In the
    43-day war, the Air Force was, for the first time in modern combat, the equal
    partner of land and sea power. The Air Force went into the Gulf talking in cold
    war terms about air superiority and sustainable casualties and came out
    trumpeting air supremacy with minimum casualties. Within 6 months, 27 September
    1991, strategic bomber crews were ordered to stand down from their decades-long
    round-the-clock readiness for nuclear war. The Cold War was officially over, a
    new world had arrived, and the role of enlisted Airmen changed.</span></p>

    <p id="P-2292"><span id="SPAN-2293">2.13.1.&nbsp;When the
    American-led international coalition bombed Iraq and drove the forces of Iraq
    from Kuwait in 1991, Saddam Hussein's power was weakened. Rebellious Kurds in
    northern Iraq, whom Hussein brutally suppressed with chemical weapons 3 years
    earlier, launched an uprising in early March 1991. When Iraqi government troops
    defeated the rebellion a month later, threatening to repeat the massacres of
    the past, more than a million Kurds fled to Iran and Turkey. Hundreds of
    thousands more gathered on cold mountain slopes on the Iraqi-Turkish border.
    Lacking food, clean water, clothing, blankets, medical supplies, and shelter,
    the refugees suffered enormous mortality rates.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-2294"><span id="SPAN-2295">2.13.2.&nbsp;On 3 April
    1991, the United Nations Security Council authorized a humanitarian relief
    effort for the Iraqi Kurds. During the first week in April, the United States
    organized a combined task force for Operation PROVIDE COMFORT. About 600
    pallets of relief supplies were delivered per day, but airdrops alone proved
    inadequate. Moreover, the operation failed to address the root of the problem.
    The refugees could not stay where they were, and Turkey, faced with a restless
    Kurdish population of their own, refused to admit them in large numbers. Operation
    PROVIDE COMFORT, therefore, evolved into a larger-phased operation for American
    ground troops.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-2296"><span id="SPAN-2297">2.13.3.&nbsp;After 1993,
    Saddam Hussein rarely challenged coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly
    zones, but United States units remained wary. On 14 April 1994, two American
    F-15s patrolling the northern no-fly zone accidentally shot down two UH-60
    Black Hawk helicopters, killing 26 people, including 15 Americans.
    Misidentifying the helicopters as hostile, the F-15 pilots failed to receive
    contrary information from either the helicopters or an orbiting E-3 aircraft.
    The friendly fire incident aroused negative public opinion and a demand for
    changes to prevent such accidents in the future.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-2298"><span id="SPAN-2299">2.13.4.&nbsp;Phase II of
    Operation PROVIDE COMFORT ended in December 1996, thanks largely to infighting
    among Kurdish factions vying for power. When one Kurdish group accepted Iraqi
    backing to drive another from the northern Iraqi city of Irbil, United States
    transports participating in Operations QUICK TRANSIT I, II, and III airlifted many
    displaced Kurds to safe areas in Turkey. During Operation PACIFIC HAVEN, 7,000

    WARRIOR, the introduction of thousands of additional United States Armed Forces
    personnel into the theater. Operation SOUTHERN WATCH became the United States
    Air Force test for the Air and Space Expeditionary Force concept in October
    1995, when a composite unit designed to replace temporarily a United States
    Navy carrier air wing leaving the gulf area arrived to support flying
    operations. The Air and Space Expeditionary Force arrived fully armed and began
    flying within 12 hours of landing. The Air and Space Expeditionary Force

    United States Air Force planners worked through evolving variations, not knowing
    which plan would be implemented. At nearly the last minute, a diplomatic
    proposal that former President James (Jimmy) E. Carter offered persuaded the
    military leader in Haiti to relinquish control. The unexpected decision caused
    a mission change from invasion to insertion of a multinational peacekeeping
    force. On 19 September 1994, the Joint Chief of Staff directed execution of the
    passive-entry plan. For the Air Force, this meant activating an aerial force of
    more than 200 aircraft: transports, special operations, and surveillance

    Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence from the Yugoslav federation
    dominated by Eastern Orthodox Serbia. In early 1992, predominantly Muslim
    Bosnia-Herzegovina (Bosnia) also severed ties to the Federation. Fearing their
    minority status, armed Serbs within Bosnia began forming their ethnic state by
    seizing territory and, in the spring, besieging the Bosnian capital of

    ethnic Albanian population. That oppression eventually turned to violence and
    mass killings, and the international community began to negotiate with Serbian
    leaders in the spring of 1998 for a solution acceptable to all parties. The
    Serbs, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, considered the matter an internal
    one. A final effort to negotiate a settlement began in January 1999 at

    accept NATO terms to end the conflict in Kosovo. Named Operation ALLIED FORCE,
    NATO leaders hoped a few days of airstrikes to demonstrate NATO's resolve would
    force Milosevic to capitulate. That was not the case and took 78 days with more

    could outwait NATO. In addition, the precision and the persistence of the air
    campaign were fundamental factors in convincing Milosevic to end the fight. The
    air campaign started slowly but gathered momentum as the air campaign went on
    and became increasingly damaging to Milosevic's entire military infrastructure,

    was completing a routine pre-brief for a combat control mission at his deployed
    location in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. While his team loaded gear into their
    vehicles, an Afghan National Police Officer suddenly turned and opened fire
    with a truck-mounted machine gun 25 feet away. Simultaneously, 15 to 20
    insurgents just outside the village engaged the base with heavy machine
    gunfire. With rounds striking and killing his teammates surrounding him,
    Technical Sergeant Sheridan closed in on the gunman with a pistol and M-4
    Rifle, neutralizing the immediate threat with deadly accuracy. Still under
    heavy attack from outside insurgents, Technical Sergeant Sheridan exposed
    himself to heavy machine gunfire three more times to drag his wounded teammates
    out of the line of fire to a protected casualty collection point. Once his
    wounded teammates were pulled to safety, Technical Sergeant Sheridan directed
    close air support and surveillance aircraft to pinpoint, engage and eliminate
    the additional insurgents. During these efforts, Technical Sergeant Sheridan
    also aided in assessing and moving his wounded teammates, while directing the
    entrance and exit of six medical evacuation helicopters. Sergeant Sheridan s
    calmness and leadership in the face of danger helped saved 23 lives and allowed
    for the evacuation of his critically wounded teammates. For these actions,
    Technical Sergeant Sheridan was awarded the Silver Star. He also received one
    of the Air Force's most prestigious awards, the 2013 Lance P. Sijan United
    States Air Force Leadership Award. Lastly he was selected as one of the 12
    Outstanding Airmen of the Year for 2014.</span></p>

    President Obama announced on 19 August 2014 that he planned to withdraw the
    last American troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2016. Under a new timetable
    the 32,000 American troops now in Afghanistan would be reduced to 9,800 after
    this year (2014). That number would be cut in half by the end of 2015, and by
    the end of 2016, there would be only a vestigial force to protect the embassy
    in Kabul and to help the Afghans with military purchases and other security
    matters. At the height of American involvement, in 2011, the United States had
    101,000 troops in the country. Besides carrying out operations against the
    remnants of Al Qaeda, the troops that stay behind will train Afghan security
    forces. But from 2015 onward, they will be quartered at Bagram Airfield and in
    Kabul, the capital. While they will be supplemented by NATO troops, alliance
    members should follow America's lead in pulling out by the end of 2016. The shift

    <p id="P-2586"><span id="SPAN-2587">The Armed Forces of the
    United States are not separate and independent parts of the government; rather,
    they compose one of the instruments of national policy. Since the birth of the
    Nation, policies and directives have been made by civilians assigned to the
    military and to the executive and legislative branches of the government.
    Military leaders do not make national military policy decisions. Civilian
    leadership is a key concept in the military organization, beginning with the
    President's role as Commander in Chief. This chapter begins with a discussion
    of the President's role. The chapter highlights the structure of the Department
    of Defense and defines the roles of the military departments, Joint Chiefs of
    Staff, unified combatant commands, and combined commands. Finally, this chapter
    emphasizes the key elements of the Department of the Air Force, focuses on
    force structure and major commands, and includes a discussion about the
    structure and functions of the various lower levels of command and Air Reserve
    Components.&nbsp;<b id="B-2588"><i id="I-2589">Section 3B Command Authority and Department of Defense</i></b></span></p>

    the Departments of the Army, Navy (including the United States Marine Corps),

    policy related to all matters of direct and primary concern to the Department
    of Defense, and for the execution of approved policy. The operational chain of
    command runs from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the combatant
    commanders. A specific responsibility of the Secretary of Defense is providing
    written policy guidance for Department of Defense component chief's use to
    prepare and review program recommendations and budget proposals. The
    Secretary's guidance includes national security objectives and policies,
    military mission priorities, and the projected levels for available resources.
    The Secretary of Defense also provides the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff with
    written policy guidance to prepare and review contingency plans. The
    Secretaries of the military departments and the commanders of the combatant
    commands are provided written guidelines to direct the effective detection and

    combatant commander deploys, directs, controls, and coordinates the action of
    the command's forces; conducts joint training exercises; and controls certain
    support functions. Combatant commanders are responsible to both the Secretary
    of Defense and the President. Unified combatant commands are organized

    same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size
    do not warrant wing-level designation. Groups will have a minimum adjusted

    challenges. We have been engaged in combat while transforming into a smaller,
    leaner, and more capable force. Fiscal constraints combined with operational
    challenges and a dynamic international security environment translate into
    risks we continue to manage and mitigate in order to provide capabilities
    America needs. The Air Force continues to fight the war on terrorism and prepares
    to face new threats and conflicts of the future. In order to remain dominant,
    we must maintain our airpower advantages over potential adversaries. Modern
    warfare is changing. This is not new for America's Airmen, whose heritage spans
    and embraces change and whose culture embodies courage and innovation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3537"><span id="SPAN-3538">4.1.2.</span><span id="SPAN-3539">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-3540">Meeting the challenges in this rapidly changing world requires we
    understand and apply Air Force doctrine. Airmen may not have understood or
    consistently applied doctrine. The complexity of integrating fighting elements
    according to joint, Air Force and multinational doctrine and the uncertainty
    inherent in rapidly developing contingency operations demand that planning and
    employment be understood and repeatable. We must learn and practice our own doctrine.
    We know how to do it right; we have taken the time to research, write it down,
    and publish it. We must understand what it means to be an Airman, and we must
    be able to articulate what air power can bring to the joint fight. Volume
    1,&nbsp;<i id="I-3541">Air Force Basic Doctrine,</i>&nbsp;is the Air Force's premier
    statement of our beliefs, and the cornerstone upon which our service identity
    is based. Air Force Doctrine is developed by the LeMay Center for Doctrine
    Development and Education at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Air Force
    doctrine is web-based, and is available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/" id="A-3542"><span id="SPAN-3543">https://doctrine.af.mil/</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/" id="A-3544"><span id="SPAN-3545">.</span></a></p>

    air expeditionary task force, or may be composed of the air component to the
    joint task force or combatant commander (CCDR) as the C-Numbered Air Force or
    CMajor Command. The AEF is the Air Force methodology to provide Air Force
    forces and support on a rotational, predictable basis. Three principles are the
    foundation upon which the AEF is structured and executed: transparency,
    predictability, and equitability. Transparency is the sense that there is no
    mystery to the process; when, why, and how should be visible and understandable
    by every Airman. Every Air Force member is responsible for knowing and
    understanding the AEF original structure, how we deploy today's AEF, and our
    goals for the future. By aligning forces in AEF bands and utilizing the teaming
    concept our Air Force is able to determine who goes first, defines our battle
    rhythm, and provides a logically organized structure during surge periods to
    support CCDRs. The AEF is merely a vehicle for managing and scheduling Air
    Force forces for expeditionary purposes; it is not a warfighting organization.
    The Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) is normally the warfighting
    organization attached to the JFC.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3550"><span id="SPAN-3551">4.1.4.</span><span id="SPAN-3552">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-3553">Joint warfare is team warfare. Over time, the American experience
    in war increasingly demanded cooperation, coordination, and integration of all
    U.S. military Services. Today, joint operations are routine and, thus,
    routinely practiced. Effectively integrated joint forces are able to rapidly
    and efficiently identify and engage adversary weak points and vulnerabilities,
    without exposing their own weak points or seams, to ensure mission
    accomplishment. Whether there are years to prepare and plan (as in the World
    War II Normandy invasion), months (as in Operation DESERT STORM), or only a few
    weeks (as in Operation ENDURING FREEDOM), American armed forces must always be
    ready to operate in smoothly functioning, joint teams.</span></p>

    <p id="P-3564"><span id="SPAN-3565">One way to explore good
    doctrine is to use a  compare and contrast  model to walk through some key
    issues. This technique also amplifies the point that doctrine should be written
    broadly, allowing decision makers latitude in interpretation and flexibility in
    application, yet be specific enough to provide informed guidance. This
    technique also illustrates the use of doctrine in explaining contentious issues
    and how doctrine can be used to think more effectively about the best means to
    integrate various aspects of military power and organization. In the following
    discussion, there may be overlap among some of the principles expressed; this
    is desirable in that often there are different aspects or nuances to a
    particular issue. In doctrine, language is important. Finally, the following
    discussion presents an Air Force perspective; not all Services may entirely
    agree with these points.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" id="A-3566"><span id="SPAN-3567">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" id="A-3568"><span id="SPAN-3569">Reference:

    This principle specifically addresses the perceived differences between
    operations in air, space, and cyberspace. Air, space, and cyberspace are
    separate domains requiring exploitation of different sets of physical laws to
    operate in, but are linked by the effects they can produce together. To achieve
    a common purpose, air, space, and cyberspace capabilities need to be
    integrated. Therefore, Air Force doctrine focuses on the best means to obtain
    warfighting effects regardless of the medium in which a platform operates. As
    an example, Airmen should be concerned with the best means of employing
    intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, not whether a
    particular intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platform is airborne
    or in orbit. This is requisite to achieving true integration across any given
    collection of forces.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3584"><span id="SPAN-3585">4.2.2.</span><span id="SPAN-3586">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-3587">Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b id="B-3588"><i id="I-3589">effects</i></b>, not&nbsp;<b id="B-3590"><i id="I-3591">platforms</i></b>.
    This focuses on the desired outcome of a particular action, not on the system
    or weapon itself that provides the effect. For example, doctrine states that
    Airmen should seek to achieve air superiority, but doctrine does not focus on
    which platforms should be used to achieve that effect. A parallel example of
    this is seen in the recognition that bombers are not  strategic,  nor are
    fighters  tactical.  Similarly, it does not matter if an F-16 or a B-52
    accomplishes a given task, or whether a particular platform is manned or
    unmanned, or whether a C-17 or a C-130 delivers a certain load; the outcome of
    the mission, the effect achieved, is what's important. Thus, Air Force doctrine
    does not explicitly tie specific weapon systems to specific tasks or effects.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3592"><span id="SPAN-3593">4.2.3.</span><span id="SPAN-3594">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-3595">Doctrine is about&nbsp;<b id="B-3596"><i id="I-3597">using mediums</i></b>, not&nbsp;<b id="B-3598"><i id="I-3599">owning
    mediums</i></b>. This illustrates the importance of properly using a medium to
    obtain the best warfighting effects, not of carving up the battlespace based on
    Service or functional parochialism. Focusing on using a medium is a vital first
    step to integration of efforts.  Ownership  arguments eventually lead to
    suboptimal (and usually at best tactical) application of efforts at the expense

    Modern warfare demands that disparate parts of different Services, different
    nations, and even differing functions within a single Service be brought together
    intelligently to achieve unity of command and unity of effort. However, merely
    placing different organizations together in an area of operations is
    insufficient to meet these demands. A single, cohesive organization is required
    with clearly defined lines of command and commanders with requisite authorities
    at appropriate levels. Doctrine explains why certain organizational structures
    are preferred over others and describes effective command relationships and
    command authorities; this facilitates the rapid standup of joint and Service
    organizations during rapidly evolving situations. Ultimately, doctrine is not
    about whether one particular element of a joint force is more decisive than
    another, nor about positing that element as the centerpiece of joint
    operations; it's the total, tailored joint force that's decisive. Getting to
    that effective joint force requires smart organization and a thorough
    understanding of Service and joint doctrine.</span></p>

    True integration of effort cannot be achieved by merely carving up the
    operational environment. While segregation may have some benefit and may appear
    the simplest way, from a command and control viewpoint, to manage elements of a
    diverse joint force, it may actually suboptimize the overall effort. It
    guarantees that the whole will never be greater than the sum of its parts. For
    example, Airmen should have access to the entire theater of operations to
    maximize their ability to achieve joint force commander objectives; they should
    not be restricted from any area due to unnecessarily restrictive fire control
    measures. Also, segregating the battlespace into smaller areas of operation may
    create competition for scarce, high-demand, low-density capabilities and reduce
    combat effectiveness.</span></p>

    Synchronization is defined as  the arrangement of military actions in time,
    space, and purpose to produce maximum relative combat power at a decisive place
    and time  (Joint Publication 1-02). Integration, by comparison, is defined as
     the arrangement of military forces and their actions to create a force that
    operates by engaging as a whole  (Joint Publication 1-02). Synchronization is,
    in essence, deconfliction in time and space between different units. A useful
    means is to plan and execute operations and to prevent fratricide. However, it
    doesn t scale up to the operational level and hence is not the best means for
    achieving the maximum potential of a joint force. Synchronization emphasizes
    timing, while integration considers priority and effect to be both efficient
    and effective with scarce resources. Synchronization is bottom-up; integration,
    on the other hand, starts at the top with a single cohesive plan and works
    downward. Synchronization is an additive  sum of the parts' model, while
    integration may produce geometric results.</span></p>

    mix of Service components within a joint force. Some believe that a joint force
    requires equal parts of all the Services. This is an incorrect view. As one
    senior Air Force officer said,  joint warfighting is not like Little League
    baseball, where everybody gets a chance to play.  Any given joint force should
    be tailored appropriately for the task at hand. Some operations will be
    land-centric, others air-centric, others maritime-, cyberspace-, or

    can be applied across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war
    simultaneously, significantly increasing the options available to national
    leadership. Due to its range, speed, and flexibility, airpower can compress
    time, controlling the tempo of operations in our favor. Airpower should be
    employed with appropriate consideration of land and maritime power, not just
    during operations against enemy forces, but when used as part of a team that

    domains this is the heart of joint domain integration, a fundamental aspect of
    airpower's contribution to United States (U.S.) national interests. Airmen
    integrate capabilities across air, space, and cyberspace domains to achieve
    effects across all domains in support of joint force commander objectives. For
    example, a remotely piloted aircraft operating from a ground station in the
    continental U.S. relies on space and cyberspace capabilities to support
    operations overseas. While all Services rely more and more on such integration,
    cross-domain integration is fundamental to how Airmen employ airpower to

    expanse above the earth's surface. The third dimensions lower limit is the
    earth's surface (land or water), and the upper limit reaches toward infinity.
    This third dimension consists of the air and space domains. From an operational
    perspective, the air domain can be described as that region above the earth s
    surface in which aerodynamics generally govern the planning and conduct of
    military operations, while the space domain can be described as that region
    above the earth's surface in which astrodynamics generally govern the planning
    and conduct of military operations. Airmen also exploit operational
    capabilities in cyberspace. Cyberspace is  a global domain within the
    information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information
    technology infrastructures, including the Internet, telecommunications
    networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.  In
    contrast to our surface-oriented sister Services, the Air Force uses air,
    space, and cyberspace capabilities to create effects, including many on land
    and in the maritime domains, that are ends unto themselves, not just in support
    of predominantly land or maritime force activities.</span></p>

    original vision of combat from a distance, bypassing the force-on-force clash
    of surface combat. Originally manifest in long-range aircraft delivering
    kinetic weapons, airpower has evolved over time to include many long-range
    supporting capabilities, notably the conduct of networked information-related
    operations. This evolution has accelerated as Airmen conduct a greater
    percentage of operations not just over-the-horizon but globally, expanding
    operations first through space and now also in cyberspace. Just as airpower
    grew from its initial use as an adjunct to surface operations, space and

    focus and mutually supporting actions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3809"><span id="SPAN-3810">4.6.3.1.1. Unity of
    command is vital in employing airpower. Airpower is the product of multiple

    capabilities and provide unity of command.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3811"><span id="SPAN-3812">4.6.3.2.<b id="B-3813">&nbsp;The
    principle of objective is to direct military operations toward a defined and
    attainable objective that contributes to strategic, operational, and tactical
    aims.&nbsp;</b>In application, this principle refers to unity of effort in
    purpose, space, and time. In a broad sense, this principle holds that political
    and military goals should be complementary and clearly articulated. A clear
    National Military Strategy provides focus for defining campaign or theater
    objectives. At the operational level, campaign or theater objectives determine
    military priorities.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3814"><span id="SPAN-3815">4.6.3.2.1. The objective
    is important due to the flexibility and versatility of airpower. From the
    outset, airpower can pursue tactical, operational, or strategic objectives, in
    any combination, or all three simultaneously. By integrating the potential offered
    by air, space, and cyberspace capabilities, Airmen can overcome the challenges
    imposed by distance and time. From an Airman's perspective, then, the principle
    of objective shapes priorities to allow airpower to concentrate on theater or
    campaign priorities and seeks to avoid the siphoning of force elements to
    fragmented objectives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3816"><span id="SPAN-3817">4.6.3.3.<b id="B-3818">&nbsp;The
    purpose of an offensive action is to seize, retain, and exploit the
    initiative.&nbsp;</b>The offensive aim is to act rather than react and to
    dictate the time, place, purpose, scope, intensity, and pace of operations. The
    initiative should be seized as soon as possible. The principle of the offensive
    holds that offensive action, or initiative, provides the means for joint forces
    to dictate operations. Once seized, the initiative should be retained and fully
    exploited.</span></p>

    used as an offensive weapon. While defense may be dictated by the combat
    situation, success in war is generally attained only while on the offensive.
    Even highly successful defensive air campaigns such as the World War II Battle
    of Britain were based upon selective offensive engagements.</span></p>

    offensive advantage over other forces. In an air attack, for example, the
    defender often requires more forces to defend a given geospatial area than the
    attacker requires to strike a set of specific targets. The integration of air,
    space, and cyberspace capabilities enhances the advantages of speed, range and
    persistence found in airpower.</span></p>

    airpower's ability to mass and maneuver, and its ability to operate
    independently or simultaneously at the tactical, operational, and/or strategic
    levels of war, provides joint force commanders a resource with global reach to
    directly and rapidly seize the initiative. Whether deploying forces and
    supplies into a region, conducting combat operations, or maintaining information
    assurance, airpower provides the joint force commander the means to take the
    offensive. Through prompt and sustained offensive actions designed to attain
    operational and strategic objectives, airpower causes the enemy to react rather
    than act, denies them the offensive, and shapes the remainder of the conflict.</span></p>

    Airman's perspective, mass is not based solely on the quantity of forces and
    materiel committed. Airpower achieves mass through effectiveness of attack, not
    just overwhelming numbers. Contemporary airpower has altered the concept of
    massed forces. The speed, range, and flexibility of airpower complemented by
    the accuracy and lethality of precision weapons and advances in information
    technologies allow it to achieve mass faster than other forces.</span></p>

    capability to mass lethal and nonlethal forces on a global scale. The
    capability of airpower to act quickly and mass effects, along with its

    places the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application
    of combat power in a multidimensional combat space.&nbsp;</b>Airpower's ability
    to conduct maneuver is not only a product of its speed and range, but also
    flows from its flexibility and versatility during the planning and execution of
    operations. Maneuver, like the principle of offensive, forces the enemy to
    react, allowing the exploitation of successful friendly operations and reducing
    friendly vulnerabilities. Airpower maneuver allows engagement anywhere, from
    any direction, at any time, forcing the adversary to be on guard everywhere.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3849"><span id="SPAN-3850">4.6.3.5.1. The principle
    of maneuver is not limited to simple weapons delivery. Maneuver may involve the
    strategic positioning of capabilities that bring potential airpower to bear
    within striking distance of potential or actual adversaries. Forward deployment
    of airpower assets is one example of maneuver that, by its very presence, can
    reassure allies and deter aggressors. Also, in airlift operations such as
    SUPPORT HOPE in Rwanda, PROVIDE HOPE in the former Soviet Union, or PROVIDE
    PROMISE in Bosnia; focused civilmilitary operations and exercises that support
    theater security cooperation goals, such as PACIFIC ANGEL; or combat operations
    such as ALLIED FORCE in Serbia, ENDURING FREEDOM in Afghanistan, or IRAQI
    FREEDOM in Iraq, airpower has played a critical role in American national
    security by providing unmatched maneuverability. Whether it involves airlift or
    attack aircraft, in small or large numbers, the versatility and responsiveness
    of airpower allow the simultaneous application of mass and maneuver.</span></p>

    of force is the judicious employment and distribution of forces.&nbsp;</b>Its
    purpose is to allocate minimum essential resources to secondary efforts. This
    principle calls for the rational use of force by selecting the best mix of air,
    space, and cyberspace capabilities. To ensure overwhelming combat power is
    available, maximum effort should be devoted to primary objectives. At the
    operational level of war, commanders ensure that any effort made towards
    secondary objectives does not degrade achievement of the larger operational or
    strategic objectives. This principle requires Airmen to maintain a broader
    operational view even as they seek to obtain clearly articulated objectives and
    priorities.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3854"><span id="SPAN-3855">4.6.3.6.1. Economy of
    force may require a commander to establish a balance in the application of
    airpower between attacking, defending, delaying, or conducting other operations
    such as information operations, depending on the importance of the area or the
    priority of the objective or objectives. Also, priorities may shift rapidly;
    friendly troops in contact might drive a change in priority from one type of
    mission (e.g., interdiction) to another (e.g., close air support). Although
    this principle suggests the use of overwhelming force in one sense, it also
    recommends guarding against the  overkill  inherent in the use of more force
    than reasonably necessary. This is particularly relevant when excessive force
    can diminish the legitimacy and support for an operation.</span></p>

    <p id="P-3905"><span id="SPAN-3906">In addition to the
    traditionally-held principles of war, an additional set of principles has been
    developed as a result of experience in contingency operations. These were first
    cast as  principles of military operations other than war  and later as  the
    political dimension of smaller-scale contingencies.  A distinguishing
    characteristic of such operations has been the degree to which political
    objectives influence operations and tactics. (Note that joint doctrine does not
    contain unity of effort as an additional principle.) These additional
    principles are:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3907"><span id="SPAN-3908">4.6.4.1.<b id="B-3909">&nbsp;Often
    the military is not the sole, or even the lead, agency in contingency
    operations.&nbsp;</b>Some operations are, by their nature, predominantly
    military. In most situations, however, the military will likely be one agency
    of many. As is especially common in stability operations, military forces often
    find themselves supporting the other instruments of national power. While unity
    of command is critical within the military forces, most of these operations
    demand unity of effort among a wide range of agencies to ensure that they
    coordinate their resources and focus on the same goal.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3910"><span id="SPAN-3911">4.6.4.1.1.<b id="B-3912">&nbsp;Unity
    of effort becomes critical during interagency operations and can best be
    achieved through consensus building.&nbsp;</b>Whereas the main effort in
    military planning is on developing courses of action, the main effort in
    interagency planning should be to develop a shared, detailed understanding of
    the situation. This allows the various agencies to better understand how they
    can best apply their respective capabilities and measure success.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3913"><span id="SPAN-3914">4.6.4.2.<b id="B-3915">&nbsp;Restraint
    is the disciplined application of military force appropriate to the
    situation.&nbsp;</b>Commanders should recognize that in some types of
    operations, use of more force than the minimum that is reasonably necessary
    (even though under or at the maximum permissible) may lead to escalation to a
    higher intensity conflict; could adversely affect efforts to gain or maintain
    legitimacy; and may impede the attainment of both short- and long-term goals.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3916"><span id="SPAN-3917">4.6.4.2.1. Air component
    commanders should begin developing a force structure by outlining the necessary
    capabilities needed for an operation and then follow up by deploying the
    appropriate  tailored  air, space, and cyberspace force mix. In order to
    maintain effective security while also exercising restraint, commanders should
    develop very clear rules on the use of force and rules of engagement. The rules
    of engagement for contingency operations are often more restrictive, detailed,
    and sensitive to political concerns than in sustained combat operations.
    Moreover, these rules may change frequently during operations. For all
    operations, Airmen should understand that restraint in the use of force is appropriate
    and more easily justified. However, restraint does not preclude the ability to
    use armed force, both lethal and nonlethal, when necessary in self-defense.</span></p>

    short-term operation to maintain stability until local authorities can take

    capacity, require a long-term commitment. The U.S. should be prepared to stay
    involved in a region for a protracted time in order to achieve its strategic
    goals. Complex problems often cannot be solved quickly; if a situation has been
    building for a long time, it may take the same amount of time or longer to
    resolve it. With this in mind, objectives should be established for the
    conditions under which forces may leave, rather than simply by a timetable for

    robust and effective military public affairs operations. Commanders should work

    evolution of airpower, but also the current appreciation for the nature of
    airpower. The tenets of airpower complement the principles of joint operations.
    While the principles of war provide general guidance on the application of
    military forces, the tenets provide more specific considerations for the
    employment of airpower. The tenets of airpower are identified below.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" id="A-3935"><span id="SPAN-3936">(</span></a><a href="https://doctrine.af.mil/dnv1vol1.htm" id="A-3937"><span id="SPAN-3938">Reference:

    of centralized control and decentralized execution is critical to effective
    employment of airpower.</b>&nbsp;Indeed, they are the fundamental organizing
    principles for airpower, having been proven over decades of experience as the
    most effective and efficient means of employing it. This tenet enables the
    principle of mass while maintaining economy of force. Because of airpower s
    unique potential to directly affect the strategic and operational levels of
    war, it should be controlled by a single Airman who maintains the broad,
    strategic perspective necessary to balance and prioritize the use of a
    powerful, highly desired yet limited force.<b id="B-3948">&nbsp;</b>A single air component
    commander, focused on the broader aspects of an operation, can best balance or
    mediate urgent demands for tactical support against longer-term strategic and
    operational requirements. The ability to concentrate the air effort to fulfill
    the highest priorities for effects and to quickly shift the effort can only be
    accomplished through centralized control. On the other hand, the flexibility to
    take advantage of tactical opportunities and to effectively respond to shifting
    local circumstances can only be achieved through decentralized execution.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-3949"><span id="SPAN-3950">4.7.1.1.</span><span id="SPAN-3951">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-3952">This tenet is best appreciated as a general philosophy for the
    command and control of airpower. The construct of centralized control is an
    encapsulation of a hard-learned truth: that control of a valuable yet scarce
    resource (airpower) should be commanded by a single Airman, not parceled out
    and hardwired to subordinate surface echelons as it was prior to 1943. Tied to
    this fundamental truth is the recognition that no single Airman is capable of
    making all decisions, and should thus empower subordinates to respond in
    accordance with senior leader intent.</span></p>

    force commander's objectives to direct, integrate, prioritize, plan,
    coordinate, and assess the use of air, space, and cyberspace assets across the
    range of military operations. Centralized control may be manifest at different
    levels within a combatant command depending on how the air component(s) is
    (are) organized and the nature of the supporting command and control
    architecture (functional or geographic). Also, due to the dynamics of the
    operational environment, control over some capabilities may, over time, shift
    up or down the command chain according to changes in priorities.</span></p>

    would rather this be just  centralized planning and direction.  From an
    Airman's perspective,  planning and directing  do not convey all aspects of
    control implied in  centralized control,  which maximizes the flexibility and
    effectiveness of airpower. Centralized control is thus pivotal to the
    determination of continuing advantage. However, it should not become a recipe
    for micromanagement, stifling the initiative subordinates need to deal with

    to political sensitivities, such as the potential for collateral damage or
    mistargeting, or in the case of nuclear employment. In all cases, senior
    commanders balance overall campaign execution against the pressing need for

    Planning and Execution System (APEX).</b>&nbsp;Joint operation planning occurs
    within a system of joint policies, procedures, and reporting structures known
    as APEX. APEX is supported by communications and information technology that is
    used by the joint planning and execution community to monitor, design, plan,
    execute, and assess mobilization, deployment, employment, sustainment,
    redeployment, and demobilization activities associated with joint operations.
    APEX formally integrates the planning activities of the joint planning and
    execution community and facilitates the seamless transition from planning to execution
    during times of crisis. APEX is the physical, virtual, and policy structure
    through which national strategic guidance is translated all the way down to
    levels used by the Air Force to plan and execute deployment activities.
    National strategic guidance proceeds through the following levels down to Air
    Force-specific guidance on deployment and support for the AEF.</span></p>

    president for Congress, outlining our nation's major security concerns and how
    the administration plans to address them using all instruments of national
    power (diplomatic, informational, and economic as well as military). The
    National Defense Strategy describes how the Department of Defense will support
    the objectives lined out in the National Security Strategy, as well as
    providing a framework for other Department of Defense guidance, specifically on
    deliberate planning, force development, and intelligence. The National Military
    Strategy provides the Chairman Joint Chief of Staff advice regarding the
    security environment; it also defines national-level military objectives (i.e.,
    ends), how to accomplish these objectives (ways), and addresses the military
    capabilities required to execute the strategy (means). The Quadrennial Defense
    Review helps articulate the latest National Security Strategy and National
    Defense Strategy by defining force structure, modernization plans, and budget

    concept plans and operation plans then often form the basis of crisis action
    planning for related contingencies. Such plans will contain tasking for the Air

    with the requisite authority to direct all forces employed in pursuit of a
    common purpose. Unity of effort, however, requires coordination and cooperation
    among all forces toward a commonly recognized objective, although they are not
    necessarily part of the same command structure.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4357"><span id="SPAN-4358">4.13.2.</span><span id="SPAN-4359">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4360">The President and the Secretary of Defense exercise authority,
    direction and control of the Armed Forces through two distinct branches of the
    chain of command and control. The operational branch, used for executing
    missions, runs from the President, through the Secretary of Defense to the
    combatant commander. The operational branch includes the following types of
    command authorities:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4361"><span id="SPAN-4362">4.13.2.1.</span><span id="SPAN-4363">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4364">Combatant command authority is the authority of a combatant
    commander to perform those functions of command over assigned forces involving
    organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating
    objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of military
    operations, joint training (or in the case of U.S. special operations command,
    training of assigned forces), and logistics necessary to accomplish the
    missions assigned to the command. It cannot be delegated or transferred.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4365"><span id="SPAN-4366">4.13.2.2.</span><span id="SPAN-4367">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4368">Operational control is the command authority that may be exercised
    by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command and may
    be delegated within the command. Operational control is inherent in combatant
    command and is the authority to perform those functions of command over
    subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces,
    assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction
    necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative
    direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary
    to accomplish missions assigned to the command; it does not include
    authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline,
    internal organization, or unit training.</span></p>

    attached forces or commands, or military capability or forces made available
    for tasking that is limited to the detailed direction and control of movements
    or maneuvers within the operational area necessary to accomplish assigned
    missions or tasks. Tactical control is inherent in operational control and may
    be delegated to and exercised by commanders at any echelon at or below the
    level of combatant command.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4373"><span id="SPAN-4374">4.13.2.4.</span><span id="SPAN-4375">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4376">A support relationship is established by a superior commander
    between subordinate commanders when one organization should aid, protect,
    complement, or sustain another force. Support may be exercised by commanders at
    any echelon at or below the combatant command level. This includes the
    Secretary of Defense designating a support relationship between combatant
    commanders as well as within a combatant command. The designation of supporting
    relationships is important as it conveys priorities to commanders and staffs
    that are planning or executing joint operations. The support command
    relationship is, by design, a somewhat vague but very flexible arrangement. The
    establishing authority (the common superior commander) is responsible for ensuring

    to employ Air Force forces as directed by the joint force commander, and if
    directed be prepared to employ joint air forces as the joint force air
    component commander. In either event, the Commander, Air Force Forces should
    also ensure that Air Force forces are prepared to execute the missions assigned

    command, subordinate unified command, or joint task force level. The Secretary
    of Defense/combatant commander may elect to permanently establish a subordinate
    unified command or temporarily establish a subordinate joint task force as part
    of his/her organizational structure. The commanders of these subordinate joint
    forces are, by joint and Air Force doctrine, joint force commanders at a lower

    resources, if available. If augmentation is needed, or if in-theater forces are
    not available, the Air Force will draw as needed from the AEF currently on
    rotation. These forces, whether in-theater or deployed from out of theater,
    should be fully supported with the requisite maintenance, logistical support,
    health services, and administrative elements. These forces will form up within
    the air expeditionary task force as expeditionary wings, groups, squadrons,

    activities as tools to assist in exercising operational control, tactical
    control, and administrative control. The Commander, Air Force Forces uses an
    air operations center to exercise control of air and space operations, and a
    service component staff (commonly called the Air Force forces staff) to
    exercise support operations and administrative control. The character of the
    operations center may vary, depending on the nature of the forces. For air
    mobility operations, the operations center may be the 618th Air Operations
    Center (formerly the Tanker Airlift Control Center) at Scott Air Force Base,
    while space operations would leverage the 614th Air Operations Center at

    Force forces staff is the mechanism through which the Commander, Air Force
    Forces exercises service responsibilities. These sustainment activities are
    sometimes referred to as  beds, beans, and bullets.  The Air Force forces staff

    to plan, task, and control joint air operations. If working with allies in a
    coalition or alliance operation, the joint force air component commander may be
    designated as the combined force air component commander. Both joint and U.S.
    Air Force doctrine state that one individual will normally be dual-hatted as

    to contingencies and crises. Joint operation planning transforms national
    strategic objectives into activities by development of operational products
    that include planning for the mobilization, deployment, employment,
    sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization of joint forces. Furthermore,
    joint operation planning ties the military instrument of national power to the
    achievement of national security goals and objectives and is essential to
    securing strategic end states across the range of military operations. Planning
    begins with the end state in mind, providing a unifying purpose around which

    instrument of national power is employed in accordance with national priorities,
    and that the plan is continuously reviewed and updated as required and adapted
    according to changes in strategic guidance, resources, or the operational
    environment. Joint operation planning also identifies capabilities outside

    developing planning assumptions; conducting an initial force allocation review;
    and developing mission success criteria (measures of effectiveness for the
    mission). Mission analysis concludes with a mission analysis brief to the
    commander and involves approval of the mission statement.</span></p>

    accomplish the assigned mission. Staffs develop course of actions to provide
    unique choices to the commander, all oriented on accomplishing the military end
    state. course of actions describe&nbsp;<i id="I-4586">who</i>&nbsp;will take action,&nbsp;<i id="I-4587">what

    action is required (the purpose), and&nbsp;<i id="I-4591">how&nbsp;</i>the action will take

    details that will allow the commander and staff to evaluate them in order to
    identify advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; The primary means of conducting
    this analysis is wargaming. Wargaming is a conscious effort to visualize the
    flow of an operation, given friendly and adversary dispositions, capabilities,
    strengths, and possible course of actions. A critical element of wargaming is
    the  red team/cell,  which role-plays and models the adversary, aggressively
    pursuing the adversary's point of view and objectives. Wargaming can be as
    simple as a turn-byturn table-top affair, or as complex as a Department of
    Defense-adjudicated game hosted on mainframe computers. Wargaming allows the
    planning staff and commander to asses each course of action for feasibility  to
    answer questions like,  can it be supported?   Is more combat capability need? 
     Can the adversary effectively counter or prevent friendly action?  The outputs
    of this step feed the next:</span></p>

    are independently evaluated against a set of criteria established by the
    commander and staff. This step should identify and recommend the course of
    action that has the greatest probability of success against the adversary
    course of action that is of most concern to the commander. Often, the staff
    develops an evaluation matrix that compares all the friendly course of action
    against the established set of criteria; this may help identify the best course
    of action. Ultimately, the staff develops a brief recommending their selection
    for  best  course of action.</span></p>

    action comparison and wargaming results and recommends a course of action for
    approval.&nbsp; The commander may approve the course of action or modify it, or
    direct the staff to reiterate portions of the joint operation planning
    process.&nbsp; From the final course of action selection, the commander and
    staff prepare a commander's estimate (previously described) and direct further
    plan or order development.</span></p>

    priorities, from a shrinking force and limited resources, to fiscal
    constraints, we must be mindful to advance only the necessary resources to
    ensure that the right capabilities are integrated and interoperable across all
    domains of air, space, and cyberspace. Competing priorities today must now be
    carefully measured against all military capabilities, ensuring that quality not
    necessarily quantity smartly contributes to a faster, more flexible, agile and
    response force. That said, we must rely on the strengths of others, or be
    interdependent, and meanwhile ensure all capabilities can effectively
    intertwine, or be interoperable with each other to achieve an overarching
    objective. One of the founding initiatives, which addressed joint
    interdependence and joint interoperability, was the Goldwater-Nichols
    Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4646"><span id="SPAN-4647">4.16.2.</span><span id="SPAN-4648">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4649">One of the first successful operational actions of combining joint
    and coalition integration was experienced during Operations DESERT SHIELD and
    DESERT STORM. These operations demonstrated an unmistakable fashion the value
    and effectiveness of joint and combined military operations. The unique
    capabilities of each of the U.S. military Services, and those of each of our
    allies, were exploited during various phases of both operations. The combined
    force provided a synergistic combat capability which brought the greatest
    possible military power of the coalition force to bear against the opponent.
    Likewise, our experience also reaffirmed the importance of joint and combined
    training, the value of forward presence and the validity of joint force
    sequencing for power-projection. A good example of this was through the use of
    the Air Force's domain of space. After the Gulf War there was a near unanimous
    agreement that space-based systems greatly increased the overall effectiveness
    of coalition forces.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4650"><span id="SPAN-4651">4.16.3.</span><span id="SPAN-4652">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4653">Clearly, history proved that collectively, the strengths,
    resources, and training of one Service or nation in today's increasingly
    complex environment, increases and/or balances the successful outcome of a
    military objective. This was seen in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan throughout
    all aspects of the global war on terrorism and through other worldwide security
    challenges.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4654"><span id="SPAN-4655">4.16.4.</span><span id="SPAN-4656">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4657">The U.S. Air Force's unity of effort, through the application of
    air, space, and cyberspace, provides unique capabilities that bridge a
    comprehensive joint and coalition approach. This unity of effort involves the
    coordination and cooperation toward common objectives, even if the participants
    are not necessarily part of the same command or organization, but the product
    of successful unified action (Joint Publication 1-02).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4658"><span id="SPAN-4659">4.16.5.</span><span id="SPAN-4660">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4661">Our doctrine continues to evolve; we now rarely see any one
    Service or any one country unilaterally plan, organize, or execute an
    operation, but we see inclusiveness with joint, coalition, and sometimes
    interagency partners, whereby we depend on each other to succeed in today s
    complex environment. Through this interdependence we are able to select the
    right resources and capabilities from each other. These capabilities simply do
    not get used when a contingency arises, but are synergized and tested through
    such venues as exercises and operations to ensure all joint, and when
    necessary, coalition partners can meet the desired objectives at the right time
    and right place.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-4662"><span id="SPAN-4663">4.16.6.</span><span id="SPAN-4664">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-4665">Each Service and coalition brings a unique balance to every
    operation and, depending upon the circumstances, the balance may shift from one
    Service or nation due to the different operating environments and applications
    necessary to support the best options. Our Air Force tenet of centralized
    control, decentralized execution is a great example of this. When employing
    strategic air attack as a line of operations, which defines the interior or
    exterior orientation of the force in relation to the enemy or that connects
    actions on nodes and/or decisive points related in time and space to an
    objective, we will require a high degree of centralization under an air
    commander, known as the joint force air component commander. The joint force
    air component commander must have authority over all forces, foreign or
    domestic, to direct operations, including attack sequencing and make
    adjustments as operations unfold. On the contrary, if tactical air operations
    are necessary to support ground troops using close air support, these air
    resources are best when decentralized to support ground commanders. The tenet
    of Airpower is never prosecuted alone, but space and cyberspace, which belongs
    to no one state, remains a vital imperative for joint force operations.</span></p>

    DAWN over Libya in 2011. During this operation, the joint and combined
    operations provided one of the greatest uses of joint and coalition
    capabilities in our recent history. In an effort to support multi-national
    efforts necessary to protect civilians in Libya from attacks by the regime of
    Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadhafi, the U.S. Africa Command task force was
    assigned to provide operational and tactical command and control of U.S.
    military forces supporting the international response to the unrest in Libya
    and enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973. At the
    start of operations, U.S. Africa Command, commanded by General Carter Ham,
    exercised strategic command. Tactical command in the theater of operations was
    executed from USS&nbsp;<i id="I-4670">Mount Whitney&nbsp;</i>in the Mediterranean Sea under
    supported command of Admiral Sam Locklear, Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Africa.
    U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates indicated that control of the operation

    in conducting antigovernment protests and demonstrations, time passed and the
    Qadhafi regime increasingly began to use military force against its citizens in
    efforts to repress the uprising. The Arab League meeting in Cairo asked the
    United Nations Security Council to impose a no-fly zone over Libya to protect
    civilians from air attack and declaring that the Qadhafi government had lost
    its sovereignty. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1973
    authorizing all necessary measures to protect civilians in Libya. The
    resolution authorized the use of force and the enforcement of a no-fly zone
    over Libya. The U.S. Secretary of Defense approved and ordered the use of U.S.
    military forces in strikes against the government of Libya. The International
    Coalition took measures to begin enforcement of United Nations Security Council
    Resolution 1973, to include the imposition of a no-fly zone, launched strikes

    AV-8B Harriers, U.S. Navy EA-18G Growlers, which were diverted from operations
    over Iraq and jammed Libyan radar and communications, and Air Force F-15 and
    F-16 fighter jets. A military convoy was destroyed south of Benghazi by air

    military contingency or operation, whether in peacetime or wartime, can
    optimize its objective without space or cyberspace. Airpower offers speed,
    agility, flexibility, range, and responsiveness to virtually every need, and
    airpower has demonstrated its success to meet our homeland and international
    security challenges by leveraging our respective capabilities and maximizing
    resulting synergy. Cyber operations guarantee our capability to operate in any
    contested cyber domain to support vital land, sea, air, and space missions by
    developing capabilities to protect essential military cyber systems and to
    speed their recovery if an attack does occur. In these interdependent domains
    the Air Force possesses unique capabilities for ensuring global mobility,
    long-range strike, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The
    benefits of airpower extend beyond the air domain, and operations among the
    air, land, maritime, space, and cyber domains are increasingly interdependent
    upon each other for the success of any and all national military objectives.

    United States Air Force to carry out its mission of Global Vigilance, Global
    Reach, and Global Power directly depends on continuance of the mission in the
    face of adversity. Challenges to mission accomplishment take many forms ranging
    from natural disasters, man-made incidents, terrorist use of weapons of mass
    destruction, and hostile attacks that threaten United States interests. The Air
    Force Emergency Management Program was developed to ensure the readiness of our
    Total Force to prepare for, respond to, and recover from the effects of
    incidents that endanger the lives of personnel and jeopardize mission
    accomplishment. Airmen may be called upon to serve the program in a variety of
    ways; from attending localized emergency preparedness briefings to being a
    member of a specialized team. In today's threat-laden environment, every Airman
    must play their part to ensure their installation has a successful Emergency
    Management program.</span></p>

    In contrast, ionizing radiation has sufficient energy to produce ions when it
    interacts with matter (including the human body). Radiation causes harmful effects
    to personnel because the ionization and excitation alters or destroys cell
    processes and structures essential for the normal functioning of the cell.</span></p>

    across an area without a nuclear detonation. A radiological dispersal device
    could function as a terror weapon or terrain-denial mechanism. For example, a

    of a nuclear detonation include blast/shock, thermal radiation (heat), ionizing
    radiation, and ballistic debris for surface and shallow subsurface bursts.
    Nuclear blasts may also pose an electromagnetic pulse hazard that can cause
    widespread communications and/or electrical problems. Each type of burst has a
    different level of hazard ratio in regards to ionizing radiation, thermal
    radiation, and blast/shock. For example, a subsurface burst may produce a high

    radiological material. Toxic industrial materials may be manufactured, stored,
    distributed, or transported in close proximity to airbases. These widely
    available toxic industrial materials are potential tools for asymmetric attacks

    radiological, and nuclear threat areas, contamination avoidance is the key to
    preventing assets and personnel from becoming contaminated. Implementing
    quality avoidance procedures will ensure mission critical assets are available
    for use when needed and allow for the survival of the base populace to employ
    those resources.</span></p>

    <p id="P-5230"><span id="SPAN-5231">Prior to a chemical,
    biological, radiological, and nuclear attack, every unit must determine which
    equipment and assets can be stored, protected, or covered to protect against
    chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear contamination. Protecting these
    vital resources will minimize or completely remove the requirement to
    decontaminate and make the resource available for mission use quickly after an
    attack. To the maximum extent possible, aircraft, vehicles, aerospace ground
    equipment, and munitions should be covered or moved inside. Bulk supplies
    should be placed in shelters or under overhead cover. If equipment cannot be
    placed under overhead cover, it must be covered or wrapped with at least one
    layer of barrier material to prevent contamination. However, the use at least
    two layers of barrier material to cover the top, so any contamination can be
    easily removed, safely discarded, and replaced is best. Resource protection
    provides you with survival and sustainment measures for operations after
    chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warfare events.</span></p>

    and after a chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear attack are critical
    to not only ensure the Air Force mission is continued but more importantly for
    your survival. During attacks, the primary focus of the base populace should be
    directed toward force survivability to ensure attack warning signals and
    mission-oriented protective posture levels are disseminated to the lowest level
    rapidly. However, Airmen who recognize an attack in progress should take
    immediate action regardless if mass notification has been disseminated.</span></p>

    <p id="P-5249"><span id="SPAN-5250">Typically, the command
    post will disseminate the attack warning signals via giant voice and other mass
    notification means. Alarm signals and mission-oriented protective posture level
    changes come to the command post from the Crisis Action Team based on
    recommendations from the Emergency Operations Center.</span></p>

    <p id="P-5256"><span id="SPAN-5257">Airmen need to use their
    best judgment regarding how far they can run during an attack to gain overhead
    cover or protection versus taking cover in an open area. Each situation is
    different, therefore it is important for Airmen to gain situational awareness
    and familiarize themselves with the surrounding environment before an attack
    takes place. When Alarm Red is declared, or attack begins without notification,
    drop to the ground, don protective mask (if not donned already), crawl to
    closest available protection, don remaining individual protective equipment,
    and immediately check every member of your unit to make sure they are protected
    and have donned the proper equipment. After taking cover remain there until
    directed otherwise. If your location becomes too dangerous to maintain, move to
    a safer area. Assist injured personnel if possible.</span></p>

    mission is a top priority. Minimizing the amount of personnel exposed to post
    attack hazards is critical for mission continuation and force survivability.
    Successful base recovery efforts require a coordinated and integrated approach.
    The recovery concept involves a combined effort from personnel trained to
    operate as a team, using specialized equipment to spearhead recovery efforts.
    Immediate actions are necessary to treat casualties, assess damage, and control
    contamination.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-5397"><span id="SPAN-5398">5.21.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-5399">Reconnaissance.&nbsp;</b>This
    base-wide effort is initiated by the installation commander. The installation
    commander will direct when base specialized and unit reconnaissance teams begin
    post-attack chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear surveys. Unit
    control centers will be directed to release post attack reconnaissance teams to
    collect information about the effects of the attack. Post attack reconnaissance
    teams or resource owners are responsible for marking and reporting
    contamination, including contaminated equipment, to ensure approaching
    personnel are aware of the hazard associated with that resource. This will
    allow those approaching to don the appropriate protective gear to ensure they are
    protected before coming too close to the hazard. Additionally, the post attack
    reconnaissance team or resource owner must report information to their unit
    control center. The unit control center will forward unit survey information to
    the Emergency Operations Center.</span></p>

    gets on the skin or protective equipment, it must be removed immediately. The
    reactive skin decontamination lotion and M295 individual decontamination kits
    are the most effective methods of removing chemical agents. In the absence of
    an individual decontamination kit, a 5-percent chlorine solution will remove
    the chemical agent from equipment and a 0.5 percent chlorine solution will
    remove agents from the skin. The eyes are very vulnerable when exposed to nerve

    Colonel George Washington said "discipline is the soul of an Army"
    and those words still hold true in today's Air Force. Air Force standards must
    be uniformly known, consistently applied and non-selectively enforced.
    Accountability is critically important to good order and discipline of the force.
    To navigate the necessary course of action and ensure mission accomplishment, a
    leader must be willing to use more than one approach. Failure to ensure
    accountability will destroy the trust of the American public, the very people
    living under the Constitution we swore to support and defend, and who look to
    us, the members of their Nation's Air Force, to embrace and live by the
    standards that are higher than those in the society we serve. This chapter
    discusses the Law of Armed Conflict, Code of Conduct, and general standards of
    conduct. Airmen must learn these standards well enough not only to be able to
    follow them, but be able to articulate them clearly to subordinates and enforce
    proper observation by other members. Used in concert with information presented
    in Chapter 5 and Chapter 19, this chapter covers issues vital to mission
    effectiveness, especially in light of the Air Force global mission.</span></p>

    neutral, and non-belligerent States.&nbsp;The law of war is often called
    the Law of Armed Conflict.&nbsp;While DoD uses the term Law of War, most
    Air Force doctrine and publications continue to use the term  Law of Armed
    Conflict .&nbsp;The Law of Armed Conflict arises from civilized nations 
    humanitarian desire to lessen the effects of conflicts. Law of Armed Conflict
    protects combatants, noncombatants and civilians from unnecessary suffering,
    and provides certain fundamental protections for persons who fall into the
    hands of the enemy, particularly prisoners of war, civilians, and military
    wounded, sick, and shipwrecked. The law also tries to keep conflicts from
    degenerating into savagery and brutality, thereby helping to restore peace.</span></p>

    Conflict is embodied in both customary international law and treaties.
    Customary international law, reflected in practices nations have come to accept

    conduct of military operations in armed conflict. Article VI of the U.S.

    legal obligations, to include custom, is part of U.S. law. This means that
    treaties and international agreements with the U.S. enjoy equal status to laws
    passed by Congress and signed by the President. Therefore,
    all&nbsp;persons&nbsp;subject to U.S. law must observe the U.S. Law of Armed
    Conflict obligations. Military personnel, civilians, and contractors authorized
    to accompany the armed forces in combat must consider the Law of Armed Conflict
    to plan and execute operations and must obey Law of Armed Conflict in combat.
    Those who commit violations may be criminally liable and court-martialed under
    the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</span></p>

    persons are military objectives and may be made the object of attack. These
    classes of persons include: combatants, or unprivileged belligerents; and
    civilians taking a direct part in hostilities. Military objectives, insofar as
    objects are concerned, include any objects which by its nature, location,
    purpose, or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose
    total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization, in the circumstances
    ruling at the time, offer a definite military advantage. Examples include
    tanks, military aircraft, bases, supplies, lines of communications, and

    destruction. Under no circumstances may military necessity authorize actions
    specifically prohibited by the law of war, such as the murder of prisoners of

    execution or reprisal against a person or object specifically protected from
    reprisal.</span></p>

    <p id="P-5539"><span id="SPAN-5540">Although military
    necessity justifies certain actions necessary to defeat the enemy as quickly
    and efficiently as possible, military necessity cannot justify actions not
    necessary to achieve this purpose, such as cruelty or wanton
    violence.&nbsp;Moreover, once a military purpose has been achieved,
    inflicting more suffering is unnecessary and should be avoided. For example, if
    an enemy combatant has been placed hors de combat (e.g., incapacitated by being
    severely wounded or captured), no military purpose is served by continuing to
    attack him or her. Thus, the principle of humanity forbids making enemy
    combatants who have been placed hors de combat the object of attack. Humanity
    animates certain law of war rules, including prohibitions on weapons that are
    calculated to cause superfluous injury; and prohibitions on weapons that are
    inherently indiscriminate. For example, the 1907 Hague Convention prohibits the
    use of poison or poisoned weapons in combat. Also, indiscriminate chemical,
    biological, and bacterial weapons are banned by treaties because they cause
    unnecessary suffering. However, using rifles to shoot prisoners of war,
    strafing civilians, firing on shipwrecked mariners or downed aircrews are
    lawful weapons that may be used unlawfully.</span></p>

    imposes a requirement to distinguish (also termed "discriminate")
    between the civilian population (or individual civilians not taking a direct

    an obligation to separate civilians and civilian objects (either in the

    one is justified in acting, one must not act in way that is unreasonable or
    excessive.&nbsp;Proportionality generally weighs the justification for
    acting against the expected harms to determine whether the latter are
    disproportionate in comparison to the former. In war, incidental damage to the
    civilian population and civilian objects is unfortunate and tragic, but
    inevitable. Thus, applying the proportionality rule in conducting attacks does
    not require that no incidental damage result from attacks. Rather, this rule
    obliges persons to refrain from attacking where the expected harm incidental to
    such attacks would be excessive in relation to the military advantage
    anticipated to be gained.</span></p>

    to means, expedients, or conduct that would constitute a breach of trust with

    The Geneva Conventions consist of four separate international treaties that aim
    to protect all persons taking no active part in hostilities, including members

    such attack is on a lawful target by lawful means. With limited exceptions, the
    Law of Armed Conflict does not authorize civilians to take an active or direct

    necessity authorizes aerial attacks on combatants and other lawful military
    objectives. Military objectives are limited to those objects or installations

    protects civilian populations. Military attacks against cities, towns, or
    villages not justified by military necessity are forbidden. Attacking civilians
    for the sole purpose of terrorizing them is also prohibited. Although civilians
    may not be made the object of a direct attack, Law of Armed Conflict recognizes
    that a military objective need not be spared because its destruction may cause
    collateral damage that results in the unintended death or injury to civilians
    or damage to their property. Commanders and their planners must take into
    consideration the extent of damage to civilian objects and casualties
    anticipated as a result of an attack on a military objective and seek to avoid
    or minimize civilian casualties and destruction. Anticipated damage to civilian
    objects and civilian casualties must not be disproportionate to the military
    advantage sought. Judge advocate, intelligence, and operations personnel play a
    critical role in determining the propriety of a target and the choice of weapon
    to be used under the particular circumstances known to the commander when
    planning an attack.</span></p>

    camps. However, if these protected objects are used for military purposes, they

    permitted by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to give name, rank, service
    number, and date of birth. Under the Geneva Conventions, the enemy has no right
    to try to force a prisoner of war to provide any additional information.
    However, it is unrealistic to expect a prisoner of war to remain confined for
    years reciting only name, rank, service number, and date of birth. Many
    prisoner of war camp situations exist in which certain types of conversation
    with the enemy are permitted. For example, a prisoner of war is allowed, but not
    required by the Code of Conduct, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or the
    Geneva Conventions, to fill out a Geneva Conventions capture card, to write
    letters home, and to communicate with captors on matters of health and welfare.
    The senior prisoner of war is required to represent prisoners of war in matters
    of camp administration, health, welfare, and grievances.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-5895"><span id="SPAN-5896">6.14.5.1.2. A prisoner
    of war must resist, avoid, or evade, even when physically and mentally coerced,
    all enemy efforts to secure statements or actions that may further the enemy s
    cause. Examples of statements or actions prisoners of war should resist include
    giving oral or written confessions, answering questionnaires, providing
    personal history statements, and making propaganda recordings and broadcast
    appeals to other prisoners of war to comply with improper captor demands.
    Additionally, prisoners of war should resist appealing for U.S. surrender or
    parole, engaging in self-criticism, or providing oral or written statements or
    communication that are harmful to the U.S., its allies, the Armed Forces, or
    other prisoners of war. Experience has shown that, although enemy interrogation
    sessions may be harsh and cruel, a prisoner of war can usually resist if there
    is a will to resist. The best way for a prisoner of war to keep faith with the
    U.S., fellow prisoners of war, and him or herself is to provide the enemy with
    as little information as possible.</span></p>

    information because of previous orders, poor memory, ignorance, or lack of
    comprehension. They should understand that, short of death, a prisoner of war
    may prevent a skilled enemy interrogator, using all available psychological and
    physical methods of coercion, from obtaining some degree of compliance by the

    <p id="P-5929"><span id="SPAN-5930">Because of their wide range
    of activities, U.S. military personnel are subject to detention by unfriendly
    governments or captivity by terrorist groups. When a hostile government or
    terrorist group detains or captures U.S. military personnel, the captor is
    often attempting to exploit both the individual and the U.S. Government for its
    own purposes. As history has shown, exploitation can take many forms, such as
    hostage confessions to crimes never committed, international news media
    exploitation, and substantial ransom demands, all of which can lead to
    increased credibility and support for the detainer.</span></p>

    military personnel detained by unfriendly governments or held hostage by a
    terrorist group must do everything in their power to survive with honor.
    Furthermore, whether U.S. military personnel are detained or held hostage, they
    can be sure the U.S. Government will make every effort to obtain their release.
    To best survive the situation, military personnel must maintain faith in their
    country, in fellow detainees or captives and, most importantly, in themselves.
    In any group captivity situation, military captives must organize, to the
    fullest extent possible, under the senior military member present. If civilians
    are part of the group, they should be encouraged to participate.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-5937"><span id="SPAN-5938">6.15.3.2. U.S. military
    personnel must make every reasonable effort to prevent captors from exploiting
    them and the U.S. Government. If exploitation cannot be prevented, military
    members must attempt to limit it. If detainees convince their captors of their
    low propaganda value, the captors may seek a quick end to the situation. When a
    detention or hostage situation ends, military members who can honestly say they
    did their utmost to resist exploitation will have upheld DoD policy, the
    founding principles of the U.S., and the highest traditions of military
    service.</span></p>

    Detainees must maintain military bearing and avoid aggressive, combative, or
    illegal behavior that may complicate their situation, legal status, or efforts
    to negotiate a rapid release. As American citizens, detainees should ask
    immediately and continually to see U.S. embassy personnel or a representative
    of an allied or neutral government. U.S. military personnel who become lost or
    isolated in a hostile foreign country during operations other than war will not
    act as combatants during evasion attempts. During operations other than war,

    continue to resist. Detainees are not likely to earn their release by
    cooperation. Rather, release may be gained by resisting, thereby reducing the
    value of the detainee. U.S. military detainees should not refuse release,
    unless doing so requires them to compromise their honor or cause damage to the
    U.S. Government or its allies. Escape attempts must be made only after
    carefully considering the risk of violence, chance of success, and detrimental
    effects on detainees remaining behind. Jailbreak in most countries is a crime.

    an important role in determining their own fate because terrorists rarely
    expect to receive rewards for providing good treatment or releasing victims

    establish rapport between U.S. hostages and the terrorists in order to
    establish themselves as people in the terrorist's mind, rather than a
    stereotypical symbol of a country the terrorist may hate. DoD policy recommends
    U.S. personnel talk to terrorists about&nbsp;nonsubstantive&nbsp;subjects such
    as family, sports, and hobbies. They should stay away from topics that could
    inflame terrorist sensibilities, such as their cause, politics, or religion.
    Listening can be vitally important when survival is at stake. Members should
    take an active role in the conversation, but should not argue, patronize, or
    debate issues with the captors. They should try to reduce tension and make it
    as hard as possible for terrorists to identify U.S. personnel as troublemakers,

    integrity that motivate attitudes and actions. Not all values are ethical
    values (integrity is; happiness is not). Ethical values relate to what is right
    and wrong and thus take precedence over&nbsp;nonethical&nbsp;values when making
    ethical decisions. DoD employees who make decisions as part of their official
    duties should carefully consider ethical values. Primary ethical values

    <p id="P-5991"><span id="SPAN-5992">6.18.1.1. Truthfulness
    is required. Deceptions are usually easily uncovered. Lies erode credibility
    and undermine public confidence. Untruths told for seemingly altruistic reasons
    (to prevent hurt feelings, to promote good will, etc.) are nonetheless resented
    by the recipients.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-5993"><span id="SPAN-5994">6.18.1.2.
    Straightforwardness adds frankness to truthfulness and is usually necessary to
    promote public confidence and to ensure effective, efficient conduct of
    operations. Truths presented in such a way as to lead recipients to confusion,
    misinterpretation, or inaccurate conclusions are not productive. Such indirect
    deceptions can promote ill will and erode openness, especially when there is an
    expectation of frankness.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-5995"><span id="SPAN-5996">6.18.1.3. Candor is the
    forthright offering of unrequested information. This ethical value is necessary
    according to the gravity of the situation and the nature of the relationships.
    Candor is required when a reasonable person would feel betrayed if the
    information was withheld. In some circumstances, silence is dishonest; yet in
    other circumstances, disclosing information would be wrong and perhaps
    unlawful.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6076"><span id="SPAN-6077">Military experience has
    shown that certain kinds of personal relationships present a high risk for
    being (or developing into) unprofessional relationships. Unprofessional
    relationships negatively impact morale and discipline. While some personal
    relationships are not initially unprofessional, they may become unprofessional
    when circumstances change. For example, factors that can change an otherwise
    permissible relationship into an unprofessional relationship include the
    members' relative positions in the organization and the members' relative
    positions in the supervisory and command chains. Air Force members, both
    officer and enlisted, must be sensitive to forming these relationships and
    consider the probable impact of their actions on the Air Force in making their
    decisions. The rules regarding these relationships must be somewhat elastic to
    accommodate differing conditions. However, the underlying standard is that Air
    Force members are expected to avoid relationships that negatively affect morale
    and discipline. When economic constraints or operational requirements place
    officers and enlisted members of different grades in close proximity with one another
    (such as combined or joint clubs, joint recreational facilities, or mixed
    officer and enlisted housing areas), military members are expected to maintain
    professional relationships. Although maintaining professional relationships is
    more difficult under certain circumstances, it does not excuse a member s
    responsibility to maintain standards.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6081"><span id="SPAN-6082">Unduly familiar
    relationships between members in which&nbsp;one member&nbsp;exercises
    supervisory or command authority over the other can easily be or become
    unprofessional. Similarly, as differences in grades increase, even in the
    absence of a command or supervisory relationship, there may be more risk that
    the relationship will become, or is perceived to be, unprofessional because
    senior members in military organizations normally exercise authority or have
    some direct or indirect organizational influence over more junior members. The
    danger for abuse of authority is always present. A senior member's ability to
    directly or indirectly influence assignments, promotion recommendations,
    duties, awards, or other privileges and benefits places both the senior and
    junior members in a vulnerable position. Once established, such relationships
    do not go unnoticed by other members of the unit. Service members must also
    avoid unprofessional relationships (including fraternization) between members
    of different services, particularly in joint service operations, because such
    relationships may have the same impact on morale and discipline as they would
    for members assigned to the same service.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6092"><span id="SPAN-6093">Dating, intimate
    relationships, and close friendships between men and women are subject to the
    same policy considerations as are other relationships. Like any personal
    relationship, they become a matter of official concern when they adversely
    affect morale, discipline, unit cohesion, respect for authority, or mission
    accomplishment. Members must recognize that these relationships can adversely
    affect morale and discipline, even when the members are not in the same chain
    of command or unit. The formation of such relationships between superiors and
    subordinates within the same chain of command or supervision is prohibited
    because such relationships invariably raise the perception of favoritism or
    misuse of position and erode morale, discipline and unit cohesion.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6097"><span id="SPAN-6098">Sharing living
    accommodations, vacations, transportation, and off-duty interests on a frequent
    or recurring basis can be perceived as unprofessional. Often the frequency of
    these activities or the absence of an official purpose or organizational
    benefit is what causes them to become, or to be perceived as, unprofessional.
    While an occasional round of golf, game of racquetball, or similar activity
    between a supervisor and subordinate could remain professional, daily or weekly
    occurrences could result in at least the perception of an unprofessional
    relationship. Similarly, while it may be appropriate for a first sergeant to play
    golf with a different group of officers from his or her organization each
    weekend in order to get to know them better, playing with the same officers
    every weekend may be, or be perceived as, unprofessional.</span></p>

    between recruiters and potential recruits during the recruiting process or
    between students and faculty or staff in training schools or professional
    military education settings are generally prohibited. These interpersonal
    relationships are especially susceptible to abuse of position, partiality or
    favoritism, or can easily create the appearance of such. This is particularly
    true during the recruiting process and in basic military training, because the
    potential recruit or junior military member is often unfamiliar with Air Force
    standards and dependent on the senior member, and the senior member is in a
    position to directly affect, positively or negatively, the career of the junior
    member.</span></p>

    member in a relationship is in the best position to appreciate the effect the
    relationship could have on an organization and is in the best position to
    terminate or limit the extent of the relationship. However, all members should

    counseling, reprimand, creation of an unfavorable information file, removal
    from position, reassignment, demotion, delay of or removal from a promotion
    list, adverse or referral comments in performance reports, and administrative
    separation. One or more complementary actions can be taken. Experience has

    unprofessional relationships. More serious cases may warrant administrative
    action or nonjudicial punishment</span><span id="SPAN-6136">.&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-6137">An order to terminate a relationship, or the

    provides the commander with a credible, independent assessment process to
    measure the capabilities of assigned forces. Supervisors at all levels play an
    integral part in this process through continual assessment of personnel,
    programs and the areas of responsibilities they supervise. Furthermore, when systematic,
    programmatic or procedural weaknesses are suspected, or to further ensure
    resources are used effectively and efficiently, Airmen at all levels may visit
    the Inspector General to report these areas as well as potential fraud, waste
    or abuse cases. This chapter provides information on the Air Force Inspection
    System, the Inspector General Complaints Program, and individual standards and

    <p id="P-6397"><span id="SPAN-6398">The Inspectors General
    mission is defined in headquarters Air Force mission directive 1-20,&nbsp;<i id="I-6399">The
    Inspector General</i>, and AFPD 90-2,&nbsp;<i id="I-6400">Inspector General   The
    Inspection System</i>. The overall purpose of the Air Force inspection system
    is to enable and strengthen commanders' effectiveness and efficiency, motivate
    and promote military discipline, improve unit performance and management
    excellence up and down the chain of command, in units and staffs, as well as
    identify issues interfering with effectiveness, efficiency, compliance,
    discipline, readiness, performance, surety and management excellence. The
    Inspectors General reports on readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline
    of Air Force organizations to the Secretary of the Air Force and the Chief of
    Staff of the Air Force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6401"><b id="B-6402"><span id="SPAN-6403">7.3. Philosophy.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-6404"><span id="SPAN-6405">Inspection is an
    inherent function of command exercised at every level to evaluate readiness,
    economy, efficiency and state of discipline. Inspection preparation, if not
    directly aligned with mission readiness, is inherently wasteful. Units will be
    inspection ready when commander's focus on mission readiness and on building a
    culture of disciplined compliance in which every Airmen does their job right
    the first time even when no one's looking. The intent of the Inspector General
    is to continuously improve the Air Force inspection system so there is an
    ever-shrinking difference   both real and perceived   between mission readiness
    and inspection readiness. Each major command commander and Wing commander will
    appoint an Inspector General who will establish an inspection program
    consistent with major command mission requirements to inspect unit
    effectiveness, surety and other inspection program elements. Major Command
    Inspectors General establish inspection programs consistent with command
    mission requirements and in accordance with this instruction to assess unit
    readiness, economy, efficiency, and state of discipline.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6406"><b id="B-6407"><span id="SPAN-6408">7.4. Inspection Types:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-6409"><span id="SPAN-6410">7.4.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-6411">Commander s
    Inspection Program.</b>&nbsp;A validated and trusted commander's inspection
    program is the cornerstone of the Air Force inspection system. The Wing
    Inspector General is responsible to validate and verify self-assessment
    programs and independently assess the performance of organizations below the
    Wing level. The commander's inspection program should give the Wing Commander,
    subordinate commanders and wing Airmen the right information at the right time
    to assess risk, identify areas of improvement, determine root cause and
    precisely focus limited resources; all aligned with the commander's priorities
    and on the commander's timeline. The commander's inspection program also
    facilitates requests for targeted assistance from the major command commander
    and staff when and where needed. The commander's inspection program produces
    two key components: (1) the self-assessment program; and (2) the Wing s
    Inspection Program executed under the authority of the Wing Inspector General
    to validate and verify commander self-assessments are accurate and timely, and
    independently assess effectiveness of subordinate units and programs. These
    components provide critical data to leadership about the adequacy of policy,
    training, manpower, funds, equipment, and facilities.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6412"><span id="SPAN-6413">7.4.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-6414">Unit
    Effectiveness Inspection.</b>&nbsp;The unit effectiveness inspection integrates
    elements of compliance and readiness using specific Inspector General
    Inspection elements to assess the effectiveness of a unit. Conducted by Major
    Command Inspectors General and the Air Force Inspection Agency on Wings and
    Wing-equivalents, the unit effectiveness inspection is a continual evaluation
    of performance throughout the inspection period. This is a photo album versus a
    snapshot. The unit effectiveness inspection inspects the following four Major
    Graded Areas: Managing Resources, Leading People, Improving the Unit, and
    Executing the Mission. The unit effectiveness inspection validates and verifies
    a wing commander's inspection program for accuracy and adequacy, and provides
    an independent assessment of the Wing's resource management, leadership,
    process improvement efforts and ability to execute the mission. A unit
    effectiveness inspection is a multi-year, continual inspection of the unit s
    effectiveness, and is intended to help the wing commander understand the areas
    of greatest risk from undetected non-compliance. The next inspection period
    begins immediately following the Unit Effectiveness Inspection Capstone event.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6415"><span id="SPAN-6416">7.4.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-6417">Nuclear
    Surety Inspection.&nbsp;</b>Nuclear Surety Inspections are an integral part of
    the Air Force Inspection System and are considered a snapshot within a wing s
    Unit Effectiveness Inspection cycle. Major Command Inspector General's use
    performance and compliance-based inspections to evaluate a unit's ability to
    manage nuclear resources while complying with all nuclear surety standards.
    Additionally, during a Nuclear Surety Inspection a unit's capability to safely
    and reliably receive, store, secure, assemble, transport, maintain, load, mate,
    lock/unlock, test, render safe and employ nuclear weapons is evaluated.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Program.</b>&nbsp;Led by unit commanders in accordance with Title 10, United
    States Code, Section 8583, the self-assessment program provides commanders with
    a means for internal assessment of a Wing's overall health and complements
    external assessments. The primary purpose of the self-assessment program for
    the commander is to accurately identify and report issues to the command chain.
    Self-Assessment programs may include a wide variety of internal assessments or
    evaluations. At a minimum, Commanders must utilize Management Internal Control
    Toolset and applicable self-assessment communicators. Commanders are encouraged
    to include additional measures as directed by superior Commanders, functional
    directives, or proven lessons and experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6424"><span id="SPAN-6425">7.5.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-6426">Management

    Air Force program of record used to facilitate self-assessments and communicate
    compliance, risk and program health. Management Internal Control Toolset
    provides the supervisor and command chain, from Squadron Commander to Secretary
    of the Air Force, tiered visibility into user-selected compliance reports and
    program status. Management Internal Control Toolset also allows functional area
    managers the ability to virtually monitor unit performance and status.
    Additionally, Management Internal Control Toolset can assist Inspectors General
    by informing the risk-based sampling strategy and formulating specific
    inspection methodology and Inspector General Team composition for the
    commander's inspection program and on-site unit effectiveness inspection

    Compliance with a self-assessment communicator does not relieve individual
    Airmen from complying with all statutory and regulatory requirements in Air
    Force instructions and directives at the local, state or federal level. As a
    self-assessment tool, Self-Assessment Communicators ask Airmen at the
    shop-level to self-report compliance or non-compliance. While the responses are
    assumed to be truthful and timely, self-assessment communicators are frequently
    verified for accuracy and currency by wing Inspectors General and major command
    Inspectors General.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6445"><span id="SPAN-6446">The Air Force Inspector
    General Complaints program is a leadership tool that indicates where command
    involvement is needed to correct systematic, programmatic, or procedural
    weaknesses. The program also ensures effective and efficient use of resources;
    resolves problems affecting the Air Force mission promptly and objectively;
    creates an atmosphere of trust in which issues can be objectively and fully
    resolved without retaliation or fear of reprisal; and assists commanders in
    instilling confidence in Air Force leadership. The primary charge of the
    Inspector General is to sustain a credible Air Force Inspector General system
    by ensuring the existence of responsive complaint investigations, and fraud,
    waste, and abuse programs characterized by objectivity, integrity, and
    impartiality. Only the Inspector General may investigate allegations of
    reprisal and restriction under the Military Whistleblower's Protection Act. The
    Inspector General ensures the concerns of Regular Air Force, Reserve, and Guard
    members; civilian employees; family members; retirees; and the best interests
    of the Air Force are addressed through objective fact-finding.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6450"><span id="SPAN-6451">The concept of separate,
    full-time installation Inspectors General was implemented to remove any
    perceived conflict of interest, lack of independence, or apprehension by Air
    Force personnel. This came as a result of the previous practice of assigning a
    chain of command and Inspector General roles to the same official. The
    installation Inspector General is organized as a staff function reporting
    directly to the installation commander.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6452"><span id="SPAN-6453">7.8.1.<b id="B-6454">&nbsp;Inspector
    General Role.&nbsp;</b>Inspectors General are the  eyes and ears' of the
    commander. They execute the commander's inspection program, validating and
    verifying unit self-assessments and providing the commander an independent
    assessment of unit effectiveness: (1) they inform the commander of potential
    areas of concern as reflected by trends; (2) function as the fact finder and
    honest broker in the resolution of complaints; (3) educate and train commanders
    and members of the base population on their rights and responsibilities in
    regard to the Air Force Inspector General system; and (4) help commanders
    prevent, detect, and correct fraud, waste and abuse; and mismanagement.
    Personal complaints and fraud, waste, and abuse disclosures help commanders
    discover and correct problems that affect the productivity and morale of
    assigned personnel. Resolving the underlying cause of a complaint may prevent
    more severe symptoms or costly consequences, such as reduced performance,
    accidents, poor quality work, poor morale, or loss of resources. Even though
    allegations may not be substantiated, the evidence or investigation findings
    may reveal systemic morale or other problems that impede efficiency and mission
    effectiveness.</span></p>

    an established grievance channel. Complainants should attempt to resolve the
    issues at the lowest possible level using command channels before addressing them
    to a higher level or the Inspector General. The immediate supervisory command
    chain can often resolve complaints more quickly and effectively than a higher
    level not familiar with the situation. Use the Inspector General system when

    nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ, they are NOT limited to
    offenses punishable by the UCMJ. (These disciplinary measures may also be
    issued to Reserve members who commit an offense while in civilian (non-Title

    service member departs from standards, the response should usually be more

    action proceedings, commanders should utilize the  preponderance of the

    offenses committed. A preponderance of the evidence means simply the greater
    weight of credible evidence. Whether such proof is available should be
    considered before initiating the administrative action. If such proof is
    lacking, administrative action is susceptible to being found to be legally
    unsupportable and, as a result, could be set aside. There is no requirement to

    <p id="P-6673"><span id="SPAN-6674">A letter of counseling
    is the lowest level of administrative action. Counseling helps people develop
    good judgment, assume responsibility, and face and solve their problems.
    Counselors help subordinates develop skills, attitudes, and behaviors
    consistent with maintaining the Air Force readiness. First-line supervisors,
    first sergeants, and commanders routinely counsel individuals verbally or in
    writing, giving advice and reassuring subordinates about specific situations. A
    verbal counseling may be recorded on a record of individual counseling.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6678"><span id="SPAN-6679">An admonishment is more
    severe than a letter of counseling or a record of individual counseling. Use an
    admonishment to document an infraction serious enough to warrant a letter of

    severe than a letter of counseling or letter of admonishment and indicates a
    stronger degree of official censure. Commanders may elect to file a letter of

    reprimand should be in writing because the corrective action is more meaningful

    admonishments and letter of reprimands should be typed on letterhead and must
    comply with the requirements listed below. Failure to follow the requirements
    for drafting and maintaining these documents could limit the use of the

    (under honorable conditions), or under other than honorable conditions. The

    one year or more would be authorized under the UCMJ; drug abuse; or sexual
    assault. A commander must make a discharge or retention recommendation when a

    <p id="P-6831"><span id="SPAN-6832">7.14.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-6833">Reasons for Separation.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6834"><span id="SPAN-6835">Airmen are entitled to
    separate at expiration of term of service unless there is a specific authority
    for retention or they consent to retention. Nevertheless, a separation is not
    automatic; members remain in the service until separation action is initiated.
    Many different reasons for separation exist. The following discussion cannot
    cover all of them; its purpose is to briefly identify major reasons for
    separation and a concise discussion of each:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6836"><span id="SPAN-6837">7.14.2.1.<b id="B-6838">&nbsp;Required Separation:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6839"><span id="SPAN-6840">7.14.2.1.1. Airmen who
    will continue to serve in another military status must separate; for example,
    an Airman may separate to serve with the Air Force Reserve or Air National
    Guard. An Airman may also separate to accept an appointment as a commissioned
    officer of the Air Force or to accept an appointment as a warrant or
    commissioned officer of another branch of service.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6841"><span id="SPAN-6842">7.14.2.1.2. Airmen with
    insufficient retainability for permanent change of station must separate.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6843"><span id="SPAN-6844">7.14.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-6845">Voluntary
    Separation.&nbsp;</b>Airmen may ask for early separation for the convenience of
    the Government if they meet the criteria. Entering an officer training program,
    pregnancy, conscientious objection, hardship, and early release to attend
    school are some of the reasons for which members may be allowed to separate.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6846"><span id="SPAN-6847">7.14.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-6848">Involuntary
    Separation.&nbsp;</b>Physical conditions that interfere with duty performance
    or assignment availability, inability to cope with parental responsibilities or
    military duty, or insufficient retainability for required retraining are
    reasons for involuntary discharge for the convenience of the Government.
    Defective enlistment (fraudulent or erroneous) is also a basis for discharge.
    Airmen are subject to discharge for cause based on such factors as
    unsatisfactory performance, substance abuse, misconduct, or in the interest of
    national security.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6849"><span id="SPAN-6850">7.14.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-6851">Discharge
    Instead of Trial by Court-Martial.&nbsp;</b>If charges have been preferred
    against an Airman and if the UCMJ authorizes punitive discharge as punishment
    for the offense, the Airman may request an administrative discharge instead of
    trial by court-martial. There is no guarantee, however, that the Airman's request
    will be granted.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6877"><span id="SPAN-6878">The U.S. Constitution is the primary source of our military law.
    The framers of the U.S. Constitution gave Congress the authority to make rules
    for the military, and Congress and the President have used their combined
    authority to create the military justice system currently in place (Figure
    7.1). The U.S. Constitution designates the President as Commander in Chief of
    the Armed Forces and vests the power to carry out the responsibilities of this
    position. Congress has the power to raise an Army and Navy, control the
    military budget, and make rules for the government of the Army and Navy. This
    separation of power is an important element of our military justice system.</span></p>

    sets out rules for evidence, procedure, maximum punishments, and provides

    that no person shall be compelled to be a witness against him or herself.
    Article 31, UCMJ, and military rules of evidence 304 reflect this right and
    prohibit involuntary statements from being used against an accused. A statement
    is  involuntary  when obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, Article 31,
    or through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement. The
    UCMJ requires that prior to interrogation or any requests for a statement from
    a person suspected of an offense, the person must be first told of the nature
    of the accusation, advised that he or she does not have to make any statement
    regarding the offense, and that any statement he or she makes may be used as
    evidence against him or her in a trial by court-martial. Prior to
    interrogation, the suspect is entitled to consult with counsel and to have such
    counsel present at the interrogation. If counsel is requested, questioning must

    <p id="P-6914"><span id="SPAN-6915">7.15.3.2.2. The area
    defense counsel program, established in 1974, made the Air Force the first
    service to create a totally independent defense function. Area defense counsel
    are assigned to the Air Force Judiciary, which falls under the Air Force Legal
    Operations Agency at Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility Washington. Although
    located at most major bases, the area defense counsel works for a separate
    chain of command and reports only to senior defense attorneys. The area defense
    counsel does not report to anyone at base level, including the wing commander
    and the base staff judge advocate. This separate chain of command ensures
    undivided loyalty to the client.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6916"><span id="SPAN-6917">7.15.3.2.3. Area defense
    counsel work to protect a client's individual interests and ensure the
    independent and zealous representation of a client facing military justice
    action or other adverse actions, thereby promoting discipline and strengthening
    confidence in justice. Most area defense counsel are selected from the local
    base legal office, but to ensure further independence, they are not rotated
    back to the base legal office when their area defense counsel assignments are

    counsel) travel to assist in the defense of particularly complex
    courts-martial. Area defense counsel are supported by defense paralegals, who

    Restraint:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6926"><span id="SPAN-6927">7.16.1.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-6928">Apprehension.&nbsp;</b>Apprehension
    is the act of taking a person into custody and the equivalent of a civilian
     arrest.  Military law enforcement officers, military criminal investigators
    and persons on guard or performing police duties are authorized to apprehend
    persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, and arrest and temporarily detain persons
    subject to the military extraterritorial jurisdiction act, when there is
    probable cause that an offense has been committed and that the person committed
    it. Although all commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers on
    Regular Air Force may apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction, absent
    exigent circumstances, the apprehension of civilians should be done by law
    enforcement personnel.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6929"><span id="SPAN-6930">7.16.1.1.1. An
    apprehension is made by clearly notifying the person orally or in writing that
    he or she is in custody. The simple statement,  You are under apprehension,  is
    usually sufficient to provide notice. During apprehension, such force and means
    as are reasonably necessary under the circumstances to effect the apprehension
    are authorized.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6931"><span id="SPAN-6932">7.16.1.1.2. NCOs not
    otherwise performing law enforcement duties may apprehend commissioned or
    warrant officers only on specific orders from a commissioned officer or when
    such apprehension prevents disgrace to the service or to prevent the commission
    of a serious offense or escape of someone who has committed a serious offense.
    The immediate commander of an apprehended person should be promptly
    notified.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6933"><span id="SPAN-6934">7.16.1.2.<b id="B-6935">&nbsp;Pretrial
    Restraint.&nbsp;</b>Pretrial restraint is moral or physical restraint on a
    person's liberty that is imposed before and during the disposition of offenses.
    Pretrial restraint may include conditions on liberty, restrictions, arrest, or
    confinement. Only an officer's commander can order pretrial restraint of an
    officer; this authority cannot be delegated. Any commissioned officer may order
    pretrial restraint of any enlisted person. An enlisted person's commander may
    also delegate such restraint authority to an NCO.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6936"><span id="SPAN-6937">7.16.1.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-6938">Conditions
    on Liberty.&nbsp;</b>Conditions on liberty are imposed directing a person to do
    or refrain from doing specified acts; examples include orders to report
    periodically to a specified official, orders to stay away from a certain place
    (such as the scene of the alleged offense), and orders not to associate with
    specified persons (such as the alleged victim or potential witnesses). However,
    conditions on liberty must not hinder pretrial preparation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6939"><span id="SPAN-6940">7.16.1.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-6941">Restrictions
    in Lieu of Arrest.&nbsp;</b>Restriction imposes restraint on a person to remain
    within specified limits, but is less severe than arrest. The geographic limits
    are usually broader (for example, restriction to the limits of the
    installation), and the offender will perform full military duties unless
    otherwise directed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6942"><span id="SPAN-6943">7.16.1.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-6944">Arrest.&nbsp;</b>In
    the Armed Forces, the term  arrest  means the limiting of a person's liberty.
    Arrest is not imposed as punishment for an offense. The notification of arrest
    directs a person to remain within specified limits. Arrest is a moral
    restraint; no physical restraint is exercised to prevent a person from breaking
    arrest. A person in arrest is not expected to perform full military duties.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6945"><span id="SPAN-6946">7.16.1.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-6947">Confinement.&nbsp;</b>Confinement
    is physical restraint, such as imprisonment in a confinement facility.
    Individuals are put in pretrial confinement only when lesser forms of pretrial
    restraint are inadequate. When a person is ordered into confinement they have
    the right to retain civilian counsel (at their own expense) or to request
    military counsel be assigned (at no expense to the accused). They also have the
    right to a prompt review of their status.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6948"><span id="SPAN-6949">7.16.1.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-6950">Use of
    Pretrial Restraint.&nbsp;</b>Pretrial restraint may only be ordered if there is
    a reasonable belief that the person committed an offense triable by
    court-martial and the circumstances require restraint. Factors to consider in
    ordering pretrial restraint include whether one can foresee that the person
    will not appear at trial or will engage in serious criminal misconduct while
    awaiting court-martial. Pretrial restraint should not be more rigorous than the
    circumstances require.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6951"><span id="SPAN-6952">7.16.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-6953">Search and Seizure:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6954"><span id="SPAN-6955">7.16.2.1. The fourth
    amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and
    seizures. The authorization to search must be based on probable cause and
    particularly describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be
    seized.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6956"><span id="SPAN-6957">7.16.2.2. Probable cause
    to search exists when there is a reasonable belief that the person, property,
    or evidence sought is located in the place or on the person to be searched.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6958"><span id="SPAN-6959">7.16.2.3.  Authorization
    to search  is the military equivalent of a civilian search warrant. A search
    authorization is an express permission, written or oral, issued by a competent
    military authority to search a person or an area for specified property or
    evidence or to search for a specific person and to seize such property,
    evidence, or person.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6960"><span id="SPAN-6961">7.16.2.4. Commanders, as
    well as military judges, installation commanders, and magistrates, are
    authorized to direct inspections of persons and property under your command and
    to authorize probable cause searches and seizures over anyone subject to
    military law or at any place on the installation. However, a commander who
    authorizes a search or seizure must be neutral and detached from the case and
    facts. Therefore, the command functions of gathering facts and maintaining overall
    military discipline must remain separate from the legal decision to grant
    search authorization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6962"><span id="SPAN-6963">7.16.2.5. The
    installation commander has discretion to appoint, in writing, up to two
    military magistrates who may also authorize search and seizure (including
    apprehension) requests. Each magistrate must receive training provided by the
    staff judge advocate on search and seizure issues.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6964"><span id="SPAN-6965">7.16.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-6966">Inspections.</b>&nbsp;An
    inspection is of a person, property or premises for the primary purpose of
    determining and ensuring the security, military fitness, or good order and
    discipline of a unit, organization or installation. Commanders may conduct
    inspections of their units. Inspections are not searches. The distinction
    between a search and an inspection is that an inspection is not conducted for
    the primary purpose of obtaining evidence for use in a trial or other
    disciplinary proceedings and does not focus on a particular suspect or
    individual. Contraband seized during an inspection (for example, vehicle entry
    checks, and random drug testing) is admissible in court.</span></p>

    <p id="P-6972"><span id="SPAN-6973">Nonjudicial punishment
    is authorized under Article 15, UCMJ. Often referred to as an  Article 15, 
    nonjudicial punishment provides commanders with an essential and prompt means
    of maintaining good order and discipline without the stigma of a court-martial
    conviction. An Article 15 may be imposed for minor offenses. Any Air Force
    member can be punished by Article 15. Commanders are encouraged to take
    nonpunitive disciplinary actions, such as counseling and administrative
    reprimand, before resorting to Article 15. However, such measures are not
    required before an Article 15 can be offered. An Article 15 should not be
    offered unless the commander is prepared to proceed with court-martial charges
    because an Article 15 cannot be imposed upon a member who demands trial by
    court-martial.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6974"><span id="SPAN-6975">7.17.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-6976">Minor
    Offense.&nbsp;</b>Whether an offense is minor depends on several factors and is
    a matter left to the imposing commander's discretion. Besides the nature of the
    offense, the commander should also consider the offender's age, grade, duty
    assignments, record, experience, and the maximum sentence imposable for the
    offense if tried by a general court-martial. Ordinarily, a minor offense is an
    offense in which the maximum sentence imposable would not include a
    dishonorable discharge or confinement for more than 1 year if tried by a
    general court-martial.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6977"><span id="SPAN-6978">7.17.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-6979">Punishments Under Article 15.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6980"><span id="SPAN-6981">The type and permissible
    extent of punishment are limited by both the imposing commander's grade and the
    offender's grade as reflected in Table 7.2. Punishments may include reduction
    in grade, forfeiture of pay, restrictions, extra duties, and/or correctional
    custody.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6982"><span id="SPAN-6983">7.17.3.<b id="B-6984">&nbsp;Procedures:&nbsp;</b>7.17.3.1.<b id="B-6985">&nbsp;</b>While
    no specific standard of proof is applicable to nonjudicial punishment
    proceedings, commanders should recognize that a member is entitled to demand
    trial by court-martial, where proof beyond a reasonable doubt by competent
    evidence is required for conviction. Commanders should consider whether such
    proof is available before initiating action under Article 15. If not,
    nonjudicial punishment is usually not warranted. Commanders must confer with
    the staff judge advocate, or a designee, before initiating nonjudicial
    punishment proceedings and before imposing punishment. The staff judge advocate
    advises and helps the commander evaluate the facts and determine what offense
    was committed. However, the commander makes the decision to impose punishment
    and the degree of punishment imposed. The military justice section of the base
    legal office prepares the Air Force IMT 3070,&nbsp;<i id="I-6986">Record of Nonjudicial
    Punishment Proceedings</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-6987"><span id="SPAN-6988">7.17.3.2.<b id="B-6989">&nbsp;</b>After
    the commander determines that nonjudicial punishment is appropriate, the staff

    punishment under Article 15 by signing the Air Force Form 3070A/B/C and
    providing it to the member. The Air Force Form 3070A/B/C includes a statement
    of the alleged offenses, the member's rights, and the maximum punishment
    allowable. After receiving the Air Force Form 3070A/B/C, the member has a right
    to examine all statements and evidence available to the commander. In practice,
    the member or the area defense counsel is provided copies of the evidence used
    to support the alleged offenses.</span></p>

    The member has 3 duty days (72 hours) to make the decision. Before making the
    decision, the member may consult with area defense counsel. A member's decision
    to accept the Article 15 is not an admission of guilt but is a choice of forum.
    The member may present matters orally, in writing, or both and may present
    witnesses. The member is not required to present any matters or make any
    statement and has the right to remain silent under Article 31(b), UCMJ.</span></p>

    assert the punishment was unjust because the offense was not committed. Thus,
    the guilty finding, the punishment, or both may be appealed. The member has 5

    <p id="P-7361"><span id="SPAN-7362">A Summary Court-Martial
    tries minor offenses. Instead of a military judge, an Regular Air Force
    commissioned officer is appointed as the Summary Court-Martial officer. The
    accused may have assistance from the area defense counsel. The Summary
    Court-Martial considers the evidence, including witness testimony, and then
    makes a finding. If the finding is guilty, the Summary Court-Martial considers
    any additional evidence before deciding an appropriate sentence. Only enlisted
    service members may be tried by Summary Court-Martial and only if they consent
    to being tried in that forum. Sentences are limited as set out in Table 7.3,
    Line 1, Column F.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7363"><span id="SPAN-7364">7.18.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-7365">Special Court-Martial.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7366"><span id="SPAN-7367">Any service member may be
    tried by a Special Court-Martial. A Special Court-Martial is the
    intermediate-level court in the military system. The Special Court-Martial
    usually consists of a military judge and a panel (similar to a civilian jury)
    of three or more members. Enlisted accused may request at least one-third of
    the panel consist of enlisted members. The accused may request trial by
    military judge alone. The proceedings include a trial counsel (prosecutor),
    defense counsel, the accused, and a court reporter to record the proceedings. A
    sentence in a Special Court-Martial may include any punishment authorized by
    the Uniform Code of Military Justice except death, dishonorable discharge,
    dismissal (in the case of an officer), or confinement in excess of 1 year.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7368"><span id="SPAN-7369">7.18.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-7370">General Court-Martial.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7371"><span id="SPAN-7372">A General Court-Martial
    tries the most serious offenses. Cases cannot be referred for trial by General
    Court-Martial without a preliminary hearing under Article 32, Uniform of
    Military Justice. The General Court-Martial is composed of a military judge and
    at least a five-member panel, and may include at least one-third enlisted
    members, if so requested by an enlisted accused. The accused may request trial
    by a military judge alone, except in a capital case (when a sentence to death
    may be adjudged). The maximum authorized punishment this court-martial may
    impose is the maximum allowable under the UCMJ for the offenses charged. For
    some offenses, the maximum allowable sentence may include death.</span></p>

    <p id="P-7379"><span id="SPAN-7380">When a case is referred
    to trial, the convening authority, generally the wing or numbered Air Force
    commander selects the court-martial panel. Panel members must be senior in
    grade to the accused and be the best qualified. Throughout the court-martial
    process, commanders and convening authorities are expressly forbidden to
    exercise any improper influence on the action of the court.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7381"><span id="SPAN-7382">7.19.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-7383">Findings and Sentence.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7384"><span id="SPAN-7385">The verdict of a
    court-martial is called the  findings.  An accused cannot be found guilty
    unless guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. A finding of guilty does not
    require a unanimous agreement, but requires at least twothirds of the members
    to vote for a finding of guilty. Voting is by secret written ballot. In the
    event of a not-guilty verdict (acquittal), the trial ends. If there is a
    finding of guilty, a pre-sentencing procedure follows immediately to help the
    court determine an appropriate sentence. A sentence of death requires a
    unanimous vote by a panel of twelve members, while a sentence of confinement in
    excess of 10 years requires the concurrence of three-fourths of panel members.</span></p>

    <p id="P-7756"><b id="B-7757"><span id="SPAN-7758">7.23. Evolution of the Military Justice System:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-7759"><span id="SPAN-7760">7.23.1. The strength of
    the military depends on disciplined service members ready to fight and win our
    Nation's wars. Military justice strengthens national security by providing
    commanders with an efficient and effective means of maintaining good order and
    discipline. Furthermore, the military justice system is a separate criminal
    justice system that does not look to the civilian courts to dispose of
    disciplinary problems. As a separate system, it allows the military to handle
    unique military crimes that civilian courts would be unable to handle.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7761"><span id="SPAN-7762">7.23.2. In addition, a
    separate system enables the military to address crimes committed by service
    members at worldwide locations in times of war or peace. The military needs a
    justice system that goes wherever the troops go to provide uniform treatment
    regardless of locale or circumstances. No other judicial system in the U.S.
    provides such expansive coverage. As our separate military justice system has
    evolved, this system has balanced two basic interests: discipline (essential to
    warfighting capability) and justice (a fair and impartial system essential to
    the morale of those serving their country).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7763"><span id="SPAN-7764">7.23.3. While military
    justice can be traced to the time of the Roman armies, the historical
    foundation for the U.S. military law and criminal justice system is the British
    Articles of War. In fact, the first codes predated the U.S. Constitution and
    Declaration of Independence. These codes were the Articles of War, applicable
    to the Army, and the Articles for the Government of the Navy. Through World War
    I, these codes went through some amendments and revisions but were
    substantially unchanged for more than 100 years. Throughout most of this time,
    the U.S. had a very small standing military. Those who entered the military
    understood they were going to fall under a different system of justice with
    unique procedures and punishments. While some people had bad experiences with
    the military justice system during this time, there was no overwhelming demand
    for change.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7765"><span id="SPAN-7766">7.23.4. This changed
    with World War II when the U.S. had over 16 million men and women serving in
    the U.S. Armed Forces. Incredibly, there were about 2 million courts-martial
    during hostilities. There were approximately 80,000 general courts-martial
    during World War II. An average of more than 60 general courts-martial
    convictions occurred per day for the duration of the war.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7767"><span id="SPAN-7768">7.23.5. The soldiers and
    sailors of World War II were regular citizens who volunteered or were drafted.
    Many of these citizens had some very unpleasant experiences with the military
    justice system, which looked quite different than today. The military justice
    system did not offer members the protections afforded by the civilian court
    system, and many American citizens disapproved of the way criminal laws were
    being applied in the military. Following the war, many organizations studied
    and made proposals to improve the military criminal legal system, and Congress
    conducted hearings on the military justice system.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7769"><span id="SPAN-7770">7.23.6. After
    unification of the Armed Services under the Department of Defense in 1947,
    Secretary James V. Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defense, decided there
    should not be separate criminal law rules for the different branches of
    Service. He desired a uniform code that would apply to all services and address
    the abuses from World War II. His efforts set the stage for a new uniform
    system of discipline. In 1950, Congress enacted the UCMJ; this legislation is
    contained in Title10, United States Code, Sections 801 through 946. The UCMJ is
    the military's criminal code applicable to all branches of service.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7771"><span id="SPAN-7772">7.23.7. The UCMJ became
    effective in 1951 and provided substantial procedural guarantees of an open and
    fair process that continues today. The UCMJ required attorneys to represent the
    accused and the Government in all general courtsmartial, prohibited improper
    command influence, and created the appellate court system. Furthermore, the
    UCMJ established Air Force, Army, Navy, and Coast Guard Boards of Review as the
    first level of appeal in the military justice system and the U.S. Court of
    Military Appeals as the second level of appeal. The Court of Military Appeals,
    composed of five civilian judges, was perhaps the most revolutionary change
    that brought the checks and balances of civilian control of the U.S. Armed
    Forces into the military justice system. In October 1994, the Court of Military
    Appeals was renamed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to bring the
    name more in line with our civilian counterparts.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7773"><span id="SPAN-7774">7.23.8. In addition to
    changing courts-martial processes and procedures, the UCMJ provided a complete
    set of criminal laws. Moreover, the UCMJ included many crimes punished under
    civilian law (for example, murder, rape, drug use, larceny, drunk driving,
    etc.), and also punished other conduct that affects good order and discipline.
    These unique military crimes include such offenses as desertion, absence
    without leave, disrespect toward superiors, failure to obey orders, dereliction
    of duty, wrongful disposition of military property, drunk on duty, malingering,
    and conduct unbecoming an officer. The UCMJ also included provisions punishing
    misbehavior before the enemy, improper use of countersign, misbehavior of a
    sentinel, misconduct as a prisoner, aiding the enemy, spying, and espionage.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7775"><span id="SPAN-7776">7.23.9. The UCMJ has
    been amended on a number of occasions. For example, the Military Justice Act of
    1968 created the position of military judge, authorized trial by military judge
    alone, required an attorney to act as defense counsel in all Special
    Court-Martials when the authorized punishment included a bad conduct discharge,
    prohibited trial by Summary Court-Martial if the accused objected, and changed
    service boards of review to courts of review.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7777"><span id="SPAN-7778">7.23.10. The next
    significant change was the Military Justice Act of 1983, which streamlined
    pretrial and post-trial procedures. The act also provided for direct appeals to
    the U.S. Supreme Court from the Court of Military Appeals in appropriate cases,
    without the need to first pursue an appeal through the civilian appellate
    courts. The act also established a separate punitive article (112a) for drug
    offenses. Today's UCMJ reflects centuries of experience in criminal law and
    military justice and guarantees service members rights and privileges similar
    to and, in many cases, greater than those enjoyed by civilians.</span></p>

    of the U.S. Armed Forces and of the militia of the states (National Guard) when
    called to federal service. By virtue of authority as commander in chief, the
    President has the power to issue executive orders to govern the U.S. Armed
    Forces as long as these orders do not conflict with any basic constitutional or
    statutory provisions. Article 36, UCMJ, specifically authorizes the President
    to prescribe the procedures, including rules of evidence, to be followed in
    courts-martial. In accordance with Article 36, UCMJ, President Harry S. Truman
    established the Manual for CourtsMartial in 1951 to implement the UCMJ. The
    Manual for Courts-Martial, like the UCMJ, has undergone a number of revisions.</span></p>

    only then) does a court-martial have jurisdiction to decide the case.</span></p>

    <p id="P-7805"><span id="SPAN-7806">7.25.1.1. Personal

    <p id="P-7807"><span id="SPAN-7808">7.25.1.2. Article 2,
    UCMJ, includes the following as persons subject to court-martial jurisdiction:
    (1) members of a regular component of the Armed Forces; including those
    awaiting discharge after expiration of their terms of enlistment; (2) cadets,
    aviation cadets, and midshipmen; (3) members of a Reserve component while on
    inactive duty training (but, in the case of members of the Army National Guard
    and Air National Guard, only when in Federal service); (4) retired members of a
    Regular component of the Armed Forces who are entitled to pay; (5) persons in
    custody of the Armed Forces serving a sentence imposed by court-martial; (6)
    prisoners of war in custody of the Armed Forces; and (7) in time of declared
    war or a contingency operation, persons serving with or accompanying an armed
    force in the field.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7809"><span id="SPAN-7810">7.25.1.3. While the UCMJ
    previously provided for jurisdiction over civilians serving with or
    accompanying an armed force in the field in time of war, the U.S. court of
    appeals for the Armed Forces held that the phrase  in time of war  meant a war
    formally declared by Congress. The U.S. court of appeals for the Armed Forces
    decided this issue in reviewing a case (<i id="I-7811">U.S. v. Averette</i>, 1970) in which
    a civilian had been tried during the Vietnam Conflict for crimes committed
    within the combat zone. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
    Year 2007, Congress amended Article 2(a)(10) to provide for UCMJ jurisdiction
    over civilians serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field in time
    of declared war or a contingency operation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7812"><span id="SPAN-7813">7.25.2.<b id="B-7814">&nbsp;Subject-Matter
    Jurisdiction:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7815"><span id="SPAN-7816">7.25.2.1. Courts-martial
    have the power to try any offense under the code except when prohibited from
    doing so by the U.S. Constitution. Courts-martial have exclusive jurisdiction
    when a purely military offense such as desertion, failure to obey orders, or
    disrespect toward superiors is involved. However, if the offense violates both
    the UCMJ and a civilian code, concurrent jurisdiction may exist. For example,
    if an Regular Air Force military member is caught shoplifting at an off-base
    merchant, the member can be tried by court-martial for larceny in violation of
    Article 121, UCMJ, and tried by a civilian court for a larceny offense
    recognized in the local jurisdiction.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7817"><span id="SPAN-7818">7.25.2.2. The
    determination as to whether a military or a civilian authority will try the
    member is normally made through consultation or prior agreement between
    appropriate military authorities (ordinarily the staff judge advocate) and appropriate
    civilian authorities. A member to be tried by both a court-martial and a state
    court for the same act is constitutionally permissible and a member who has
    been tried by a state court normally will not be tried by court-martial for the
    same act. Only the Secretary of the Air Force may approve such prosecutions,
    and only in the most unusual cases, when the ends of justice and discipline can
    be met in no other way.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-7819"><b id="B-7820"><span id="SPAN-7821">7.26. Commander Involvement:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-7822"><span id="SPAN-7823">7.26.1. Military
    commanders are responsible for maintaining law and order in the communities
    over which they have authority and for maintaining the discipline of the
    fighting force. Reports of crimes may come from law enforcement or criminal
    investigative agencies, as well as reports from supervisors or individual
    service members. One of the commander's greatest powers in the administration
    of military justice is the exercise of discretion to decide how misconduct
    committed by a member of his or her command will be resolved. Each commander in
    the chain of command has independent, yet overlapping, discretion to dispose of
    offenses within the limits of that officer's authority. A commander may dispose
    of the case by taking no action, initiating administrative action against the
    member, offering the member nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, or
    preferring court-martial charges. Ordinarily, the immediate commander
    determines how to dispose of an offense; however, a superior commander may
    withhold that authority. The staff judge advocate is available to provide
    advice, but the commander ultimately decides how to dispose of alleged
    misconduct.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7824"><span id="SPAN-7825">7.26.2. If a commander
    believes preferred charges should be disposed by court-martial, the charges are
    forwarded to the convening authority. Convening authorities are superior
    commanders or officials who possess the authority to convene specific levels of
    courts-martial (wing and numbered Air Force commanders in most cases). A
    convening authority convenes a court-martial by issuing an order that charges
    previously preferred against an accused will be tried by a specified
    court-martial. The convening authority must personally make the decision to
    refer a case to trial; delegation of this authority is not allowed. Charges may
    be referred to one of three types of court-martial: summary, special, or
    general.</span></p>

    System.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-7829"><span id="SPAN-7830">In courts-martial, both Government and the
    accused have legal counsel. In addition, detailed defense counsel must include
    judge advocates, graduates of an accredited law school, and members of the bar
    of a federal court or the highest court of a state. Moreover, counsel must have
    certification to perform duties by a service's judge advocate general. The
    trial counsel prosecutes in the name of the U.S. and presents evidence against
    the accused. The defense counsel represents the accused and zealously seeks to
    protect the accused's rights.</span></p>

    <p id="P-7834"><span id="SPAN-7835">7.27.1.1. Trial counsel
    are similar to prosecutors in civilian criminal trials. They represent the
    Government, and their objective is justice, not merely securing a conviction.
    They zealously present evidence they believe is admissible and seek to persuade
    the court that the accused committed the alleged offenses. Trial counsel argues
    the inferences most strongly supporting the charges. Highly experienced trial
    advocates (senior trial counsel) are available to assist in the prosecution of
    particularly complex courts-martial.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7836"><span id="SPAN-7837">7.27.1.2. Trial counsel
    also presents evidence and arguments to address defenses raised on behalf of
    the accused. Trial counsel may not ethically permit the continuance of the

    and do not report to anyone at base level. No person is eligible to act as
    military judge in a case if he or she was the accuser, is a witness for the
    prosecution, or has acted as preliminary hearing officer or a counsel in the
    same case. The military judge of a court-martial may not consult with the
    members of the court except in the presence of the accused, trial counsel, and
    defense counsel, nor does he or she vote with the members of the court. In
    noncapital cases, an accused may elect to be tried by military judge alone. If
    such an election is made, the military judge will make a finding of guilty or

    <p id="P-7914"><span id="SPAN-7915">For an armed force to be
    effective, they must have sufficient members present to carry out the mission.
    One way this can be accomplished is by deterring members from being absent
    without authority, whether the absences are permanent or temporary. The
    circumstances under which the absence occurs, as well as the intent of the accused,
    determines the severity of the offense. Absence offenses include desertion and
    being absent without official leave.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7916"><span id="SPAN-7917">7.29.1.1.<b id="B-7918">&nbsp;Desertion:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7919"><span id="SPAN-7920">7.29.1.1.1. Article 85,
    UCMJ, may occur under the following categories: (1) unauthorized absence with
    the intent to remain away permanently; (2) quitting the unit or place of duty
    to avoid hazardous duty or shirk important service; or (3) desertion by an
    officer before notice of acceptance of resignation. More severe punishment is
    authorized if the desertion is terminated by apprehension instead of a
    voluntary surrender or if the desertion occurs in wartime. Desertion may be
    charged as a capital offense (which authorizes the death penalty) during
    wartime.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7921"><span id="SPAN-7922">7.29.1.1.2. Absence with
    the specific intent to remain away permanently is the most commonly charged
    type of desertion. The unauthorized absence may be from the accused's place of
    duty, unit, or organization. The specific intent to remain away permanently may
    exist at the beginning of the absence or may be formed at any time during the
    absence. Thus, when a member leaves without permission, intending to return
    after a period of time, but later decides never to return, the member has
    committed the offense of desertion. However, proving intent is often difficult
    and may be shown by a number of factors, including the length of the absence,
    use of an alias, disposal of military identification and clothing items,
    concealment of military status, distance from duty station, and the assumption
    of a permanent-type civilian status or employment. The accused's voluntary
    return to military control is not a defense to desertion. The essential issue
    is whether the accused, at any time, formed the intent to remain away
    permanently.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7923"><span id="SPAN-7924">7.29.1.2.<b id="B-7925">&nbsp;Absent Without Official Leave:</b></span></p>

    UCMJ, addresses other cases where the member is not at the place where he or
    she is required to be at a prescribed time. This includes failure to go to the
    appointed place of duty; going from the appointed place of duty; absence from
    unit, organization, or other place of duty; abandoning watch or guard; and
    absence with intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7928"><span id="SPAN-7929"><br id="BR-7930">
    .1.2.2. Proving a failure to go to an appointed place of duty requires showing
    the accused actually knew he or she was required to be at the appointed place
    of duty at the prescribed time. The offense of going from the appointed place
    of dutyrequires proof the accused left his or her place of duty without proper
    authority, rather than failing to report in the first place. The accused must
    have reported for and begun the duty before leaving without proper authority.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7931"><span id="SPAN-7932">7.29.1.2.3. Absence
    from the unit, organization, or other place of duty<i id="I-7933">&nbsp;</i>is a common
    absent without official leave charge. The authorized maximum punishment for
    this offense varies with the duration of the absence.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7934"><span id="SPAN-7935">7.29.1.2.4.
     Inability to return from leave  is a defense if the accused encountered
    unforeseeable circumstances beyond his or her control. For example, if
    Technical Sergeant Jane Doe's authorized 10-day period of leave expired on 1
    December and she failed to report to her unit until 3 December, she would not
    be guilty of absent without official leave if she could establish she was at a
    distant city and had purchased an airline ticket on a flight that was cancelled
    due to a blizzard. Even though she has a defense, she is not excused from
    calling her unit and requesting an extension of leave. Inability would not be a
    defense where a military member took space-available transportation to Europe
    while on leave and then claimed he or she was unable to return on the date
    planned because he or she was unable to get space-available transportation back
    when he or she had hoped.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7936"><span id="SPAN-7937">7.29.1.2.5. Other
    absences include abandoning watch or guard and absence from the unit,
    organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid maneuvers or field
    exercises. In addition, Article 87, UCMJ, provides that missing a movement is
    an offense that applies when the member, through neglect or design, misses the
    movement of a ship, aircraft, or unit.</span></p>

    <p id="P-7941"><span id="SPAN-7942">Article
    107, UCMJ, covers both the making and signing of false official statements and
    official documents. An  official  statement or document is any statement or
    document made in the line of duty.  In the line of duty  pertains to a matter
    within the jurisdiction of any U.S. department or agency. Furthermore, you must
    be able prove that the accused knew the statement or document was false and had
    a specific intent to deceive. Examples include falsely identifying oneself to a
    base gate guard or falsely listing a person as one's dependent to gain base
    privileges.</span></p>

    (Article 134) is designed to address unspecified offenses punishable because of
    their effect on the U.S. Armed Forces. Article 134 generally provides for those
    offenses not specifically mentioned elsewhere in the punitive articles of the
    UCMJ. A military member can be punished under Article 134 for any and all
    disorders and neglects that are prejudicial to good order and discipline in the
    Armed Forces, for conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the Armed Forces,
    and for crimes and offenses not capital.</span></p>

    and Neglects Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline.&nbsp;</b>Article 134,
    UCMJ, seeks to protect the internal operation of the U.S. Armed Forces. The
    issue is the effect of the accused's act on good order and discipline within
    the Armed Forces. The effect must be reasonably direct and tangible. Disorders
    and neglects prejudicial to good order and discipline include breach of customs
    of the service, fraternization, impersonating an officer, disorderly conduct,
    gambling with a subordinate, and incapacitating oneself for duty through prior
    indulgence in intoxicating liquors.</span></p>

    of a Nature To Bring Discredit upon the Armed Forces.&nbsp;</b>The concern here
    is the potential effect of the accused's act on the reputation of the U.S.
    Armed Forces (how the military is perceived by the civilian sector). The
    conduct must tend to bring the Service into disrepute or lower it in public
    esteem. Thus, violations of local civil law or foreign law may be punished if
    they bring discredit upon the Armed Forces, such as dishonorable failure to pay
    debts, indecent exposure, fleeing the scene of an accident, bigamy, adultery,
    or pandering.</span></p>

    and Offenses Not Capital.&nbsp;</b>Acts or omissions not chargeable under other
    articles of the UCMJ, but are crimes or offenses under federal statutes, are
    charged under Article 134; for example, counterfeiting. This crime is not
    specifically listed in the UCMJ but is still a violation of federal law. Also,
    if a military member commits an act in an area over which the military
    exercises exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction with the state and no UCMJ
    article or federal law prohibits the act only the law of the state prohibits
    the act then the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act allows the member to be tried
    by a court-martial under Article 134.</span></p>

    <p id="P-7962"><span id="SPAN-7963">The UCMJ includes a
    number of offenses related to war. These offenses include misbehaving before
    the enemy, aiding the enemy, compelling surrender, improperly using
    countersigns, mishandling captured or abandoned property, committing misconduct
    as a prisoner of war, and making disloyal statements. Two especially egregious
    offenses related to war are misbehavior before the enemy and misconduct as a
    prisoner of war.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7964"><span id="SPAN-7965">.4.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-7966">Misbehavior
    Before the Enemy.&nbsp;</b>Article 99, UCMJ, provides that running away before
    the enemy and cowardly conduct are capital offenses punishable by death.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7967"><span id="SPAN-7968">7.29.4.1.1. The
    term  enemy  (as used in  running away before the enemy ) includes both
    civilian and military organized forces of the enemy in time of war and any
    opposing hostile bodies including rebellious mobs or bands of renegades. The
    term is not restricted to the enemy Government or their Armed Forces. If the misbehavior
    were caused by fear, the offense is charged as  cowardly conduct,  rather than
     running away.  Whether a person is  before the enemy  is not a question of
    definite distance, but one of tactical relation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7969"><span id="SPAN-7970">7.29.4.1.2. The
    critical element in the offense of cowardly conduct is fear that results in the
    abandonment or refusal to perform one's duty. Fear is a natural apprehension
    going into battle, and the mere display of apprehension does not constitute
    this offense. Cowardice is misbehavior motivated by fear. Genuine or extreme
    illness or other disability at the time of the alleged misbehavior may be a
    defense.</span></p>

    as a Prisoner of War.&nbsp;</b>Article 105, UCMJ, recognizes two types of
    offenses arising in prisoner of war situations. One offense involves
    unauthorized conduct by an accused who secures favorable treatment to the
    detriment of other prisoners. The other offense prohibits maltreatment of a
    prisoner of war by a person in a position of authority. The purpose of this
    article is to protect all persons held as prisoners, whether military or

    Insubordinate conduct may be expressed in many different ways and toward many

    <p id="P-7979"><span id="SPAN-7980">7.29.5.2. Article
    89, UCMJ, prohibits disrespectful acts or language used toward a superior
    commissioned officer in his or her capacity as an officer or as a private
    individual. Therefore, the superior commissioned officer does not need to be in
    the execution of his or her office at the time of the disrespectful behavior.
    However, it must be established that the accused knew the person against whom
    the acts or words were directed was the accused's superior commissioned
    officer. Disrespect may include neglecting the customary salute or showing a
    marked disdain, indifference, insolence, impertinence, undue familiarity, or
    other rudeness toward the superior officer. Truth is no defense. A superior
    commissioned officer is one who is superior in rank or command.</span></p>

    91, UCMJ, similarly prohibits insubordinate conduct toward a warrant officer,
    NCO, or petty officer. However, unlike Article 89 violations, the insubordinate
    conduct must occur while the individual being disrespected is in the execution
    of his or her duties. In addition, Article 91 does not require a
    superior-subordinate relationship as an element of the prescribed offense and
    can only be committed by enlisted members.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7983"><span id="SPAN-7984">7.29.5.4. Another
    form of insubordination involves striking or assaulting a superior officer.
    Article 90(1), UCMJ, prohibits assaults and batteries against superior
    commissioned officers in the execution of their duties. Article 91 prohibits
    similar conduct toward warrant officers, NCOs, and petty officers.  In the
    execution of his office  includes any act or service the officer is required or
    authorized to do by statute, regulation, orders, or customs. An essential
    element is the accused's knowledge that the person is a superior officer or
    superior warrant officer, NCO, or petty officer. In time of war, striking a
    superior commissioned officer can be a capital offense.</span></p>

    are subject to courtmartial if they: (1) violate or fail to obey any lawful
    general order or regulation; (2) having knowledge of a lawful order issued by a
    member of the Armed Forces, which is their duty to obey, fail to obey the
    order; or (3) are derelict in the performance of their duties.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7994"><span id="SPAN-7995">7.29.6.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-7996">Lawful
    General Order or Regulation.&nbsp;</b>This term relates to general orders or
    regulations that are properly published by the President, the Secretary of
    Defense, the Secretary of a military department, an officer having General
    Court-Martial jurisdiction, a general officer in command, or a commander
    superior to one of the former. (A squadron commander does not have the
    authority to issue general orders.) Once issued, a general order or regulation
    remains in effect even if a subsequent commander assumes command. Knowledge of
    the order is not an element of the offense, and a lack of knowledge is not a
    defense. Only those general orders or regulations that are  punitive  are
    enforceable under Article 92(1). A punitive order or regulation specifically
    states a member may be punished under the UCMJ if violated. Regulations that
    only supply general guidelines or advice for conducting military functions are
    not  punitive  and cannot be enforced under Article 92(1).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-7997"><span id="SPAN-7998">.6.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-7999">Other
    Lawful Orders or Regulations.&nbsp;</b>This offense includes violations of
    written regulations that are not general regulations. The key requirements are
    that the accused had a duty to obey the order and had actual knowledge of the
    order. Such knowledge is usually proven through circumstantial evidence. The
    accused cannot be convicted of this offense merely because he or she should
    have known about the order. Failure to obey a wing-level directive that
    prohibits overnight guests in the dormitory is an example.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8000"><span id="SPAN-8001">7.29.6.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-8002">Dereliction
    of Duty.&nbsp;</b>Dereliction of duty is comprised of three elements: (1) the
    accused had certain duties; (2) the accused knew or reasonably should have
    known of the duties; and (3) the accused was derelict in performing the duties,
    either by willfully failing to carry them out or by carrying them out in a
    negligent or culpably inefficient manner.  Willfully  means performing an act
    knowingly and purposely while specifically intending the natural and probable
    consequences of the act.  Negligently  means an act or omission of a person who
    is under a duty to use due care that exhibits a lack of this degree of care
    that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar
    circumstances.  Culpable inefficiency  means an inefficiency for which there is
    no reasonable or just excuse. Merely being inept in the performance of duty
    will not support a charge of dereliction of duty, that is, officers or enlisted
    members cannot be punished for inadequate performance if they make a good faith
    effort but fall short because of a lack of aptitude or ability. Such
    performance may be grounds for administrative demotion or administrative
    discharge, but is not a crime.</span></p>

    <p id="P-8006"><span id="SPAN-8007">7.29.7.1. A lawful
    order must be: (1) reasonably in furtherance of or connected to military needs;
    (2) specific as to time and place and definite and certain in describing the
    thing or act to be done or omitted; and (3) not otherwise contrary to
    established law or regulation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8008"><span id="SPAN-8009">7.29.7.2. An order
    is in furtherance of, or connected to, military needs when it involves
    activities reasonably necessary to accomplish a military mission or to
    safeguard or promote the morale, discipline, and usefulness of command. Such an
    order may interfere with private rights or personal affairs, provided a valid
    military purpose exists. Furthermore, the dictates of a person's conscience,
    religion, or personal philosophy cannot justify or excuse disobedience of an
    otherwise lawful order. An order requiring the performance of a military duty
    or act may be inferred to be lawful and is disobeyed at the peril of the
    subordinate. This inference does not apply to a patently illegal order, such as
    one that directs the commission of a crime. An accused cannot be punished for disobeying
    or failing to obey an unlawful order.</span></p>

    <p id="P-8013"><span id="SPAN-8014">7.30.1. Air Force
    commanders must continuously evaluate force readiness and organizational
    efficiency and effectiveness. The inspection system provides the commander with
    a credible, independent assessment process to measure the capability of
    assigned forces. Inspectors benchmark best practices and exchange lessons
    learned and innovative methods.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8015"><span id="SPAN-8016">7.30.2. Criminal
    activity and intelligence operations against the Air Force threaten national
    security. When Air Force personnel commit criminal offenses, illegal activity
    occurs on an Air Force installation, or Air Force security is breached or
    compromised, the Air Force must thoroughly investigate criminal allegations and
    intelligence threats and refer them to appropriate authorities for
    action.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8017"><span id="SPAN-8018">7.30.3. The mission
    of the U.S. Air Force is to defend the U.S. and protect its interests through
    air, space and cyberspace. Many aspects of carrying out this job involve legal
    issues. This chapter provided information on the Air Force Inspection System,
    the Inspector General Complaints Program, individual standards, and punitive
    actions. All four areas are necessary to enable the Air Force to fulfill our
    national security obligations efficiently and effectively.</span></p>

    <p id="P-8037"><span id="SPAN-8038">Military customs and
    courtesies are proven traditions that explain what should and should not be
    done in many situations. They are acts of respect and courtesy when dealing
    with other people, and have evolved as a result of the need for order, as well
    as the mutual respect and sense of fraternity that exists among military
    personnel. Military customs and courtesies go beyond basic politeness; they
    play an extremely important role in building morale, esprit de corps,
    discipline, and mission effectiveness. Customs and courtesies ensure proper
    respect for the military members and build the foundation for self-discipline.
    Customs and courtesies are outlined in four sections: Symbols, Professional
    Behavior, Drill and Ceremony, and Honor Guard. Not all-inclusive, this chapter
    highlights many of the customs and courtesies that make the Air Force and its
    people special.</span></p>

    <p id="P-8173"><span id="SPAN-8174">8.2.4.3.5. When displayed
    either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost

    displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the
    union to the left of observer in the street (Figure 8.8).</span></p>

    (Figure 8.14). The 13 white stars represent the original 13 colonies. The Air
    Force yellow numerals under the shield stand for 1947, the year the Department
    of the Air Force was established. The band encircling the whole design is white
    edged in Air Force yellow with black lettering reading  Department of the Air
    Force  on the top and  U.S. of America  on the bottom. Centered on the circular

    <p id="P-8390"><span id="SPAN-8391">8.3.1.1. The crest consists of the eagle, wreath,
    and cloud form. The American bald eagle symbolizes the U.S. air power, and
    appears in natural colors. The wreath under the eagle is made up of six
    alternate folds of metal (white, representing silver) and light blue. This
    repeats the metal and color used in the shield. The white clouds behind the
    eagle denote the start of a new sky.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8392"><span id="SPAN-8393">8.3.1.2. The shield, directly below the
    eagle and wreath, is divided horizontally into two parts by a nebular line
    representing clouds. The top part bears an Air Force yellow thunderbolt with
    flames in natural color that shows striking power through the use of aerospace.
    The thunderbolt consists of an Air Force yellow vertical twist with three
    natural color flames on each end crossing a pair of horizontal wings with eight
    lightning bolts. The background of the top part is light blue representing the
    sky. The lower part is white representing metal silver.</span></p>

    honors the heritage of our past and represents the promise of our future.

    <p id="P-8414"><span id="SPAN-8415">8.4.2. The Symbol has two main parts. In
    the upper half, the stylized wings represent the stripes of our strength our
    enlisted men and women. The wings are drawn with great angularity to emphasize
    our swiftness and power and are divided into six sections which represent our
    distinctive capabilities air and space superiority, global attack, rapid global
    mobility, precision engagement, information superiority, and agile combat
    support.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8416"><span id="SPAN-8417">8.4.3. In the lower half
    are a sphere, a star, and three diamonds. The sphere within the star represents
    the globe. Moreover, the symbol reminds us of our obligation to secure our
    Nation's freedom with global vigilance, reach, and power. The globe also reminds
    us of our challenge as an expeditionary force to respond rapidly to crises and
    to provide decisive air and space power worldwide.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8418"><span id="SPAN-8419">8.4.4. The area
    surrounding the sphere takes the shape of a star. The star has many meanings.
    The five points represent the components of our one force and family our
    Regular Air Force, civilians, Guard, Reserve, and retirees. The star symbolizes
    space as the high ground of our nation's air and space force. The rallying
    symbol in all our wars, the star also represents our officer corps, central to
    our combat leadership.</span></p>

    <p id="P-8446"><span id="SPAN-8447">The procedures to use
    when showing respect to the flag and the national anthem include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8448"><span id="SPAN-8449">8.5.1.
    When outdoors, all personnel in uniform, except those in formation must face
    the flag and salute during the raising and lowering of the flag. Upon the first
    note of the national anthem or  To the Colors,  all personnel in uniform who
    are not in formation will stand at attention, face the flag (or the sound of
    the music, if the flag is not visible), and salute. Hold the salute until the
    last note of the national anthem or  To the Colors' is played.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8450"><span id="SPAN-8451">8.5.2. All vehicles in
    motion will pull to the side of the road and stop. All occupants sit quietly
    until the last note of the national anthem or  To the Colors' has played.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8452"><span id="SPAN-8453">8.5.3. When in civilian
    clothes, face the flag (or the sound of the music if the flag is not visible)
    and stand at attention with the right hand placed over the heart or render a
    salute.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8454"><span id="SPAN-8455">8.5.4. If indoors during
    retreat or reveille, there is no need to stand or salute. However, everyone
    must stand during the playing of the national anthem before a showing of a
    movie while in the base theater. When listening to a radio or watching
    television, no specific action is necessary. Additionally, a folded flag is
    considered cased; therefore, a salute is not necessary.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8456"><b id="B-8457"><span id="SPAN-8458">8.6. Saluting.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-8459"><span id="SPAN-8460">The salute is a
    courteous exchange of greetings, with the junior member always saluting the
    senior member first. A salute is also rendered to the flag as a sign of
    respect. Any Airman, NCO, or officer recognizing a need to salute or a need to
    return a salute may do so anywhere at any time. When returning or rendering an
    individual salute, the head and eyes are turned toward the flag or person
    saluted. Guidance when exchanging salutes includes:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8461"><span id="SPAN-8462">8.6.1.<b id="B-8463">&nbsp;Outdoors.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8464"><span id="SPAN-8465">Salutes are exchanged
    upon recognition between officers or warrant officers and enlisted members of
    the Armed Forces when they are in uniform. Saluting outdoors means salutes are
    exchanged when the persons involved are outside of a building. For example, if
    a person is on a porch, a covered sidewalk, a bus stop, a covered or open
    entryway, or a reviewing stand, the salute will be exchanged with a person on
    the sidewalk outside of the structure or with a person approaching or in the
    same structure. This applies both on and off military installations. The junior
    member should initiate the salute in time to allow the senior officer to return
    it. To prescribe an exact distance for all circumstances is not practical;
    however, good judgment should dictate when salutes are exchanged. Superiors
    carrying articles in both hands need not return the salute, but should nod in
    return or verbally acknowledge the salute. If the junior member is carrying
    articles in both hands, verbal greetings should be exchanged. Also, use the
    same procedures when greeting an officer of a foreign nation. Use these
    procedures in:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8466"><span id="SPAN-8467">8.6.1.1.<b id="B-8468">&nbsp;Formation.</b>&nbsp;Members
    do not salute or return a salute unless given the command to do so. The person
    in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the whole formation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8469"><span id="SPAN-8470">8.6.1.2.<b id="B-8471"><i id="I-8472">&nbsp;</i>Groups,
    But Not in Formation.</b>&nbsp;When a senior officer approaches, the first individual
    noticing the officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer
    and salute. If the officer addresses an individual or the group, all remain at
    attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the conversation, at
    which time they salute the officer.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8473"><span id="SPAN-8474">8.6.1.3.<b id="B-8475">&nbsp;Public
    Gatherings.&nbsp;</b>Salutes between individuals are not required in public
    gatherings, such as sporting events, meetings, or when a salute would be
    inappropriate or impractical.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8476"><span id="SPAN-8477">8.6.1.4.<b id="B-8478">&nbsp;Moving
    Military Vehicles.&nbsp;</b>Exchange of salutes between military pedestrians
    (including gate sentries) and officers in moving military vehicles is not
    mandatory. However, when officer passengers are readily identifiable (for
    example, officers in appropriately marked staff vehicles), the salute must be
    rendered.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8479"><span id="SPAN-8480">8.6.1.5.<b id="B-8481">&nbsp;The
    Presence of Civilians.&nbsp;</b>Persons in uniform may salute civilians. The
    President of the U.S., as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, is always
    accorded the honor of a salute. AFI 34-1201 provides additional guidance. In
    addition, if the exchange of salutes is otherwise appropriate, customs
    encourage military members in civilian clothes to exchange salutes upon
    recognition.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8482"><span id="SPAN-8483">8.6.1.6.<b id="B-8484">&nbsp;A Work
    Detail.&nbsp;</b>In a work detail, individual workers do not salute. The person
    in charge salutes for the entire detail.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8485"><span id="SPAN-8486">8.6.1.7.&nbsp;<b id="B-8487">Military
    Funeral.&nbsp;</b>When at a military funeral in uniform, salute the caisson or
    hearse as it passes and the casket as it is carried by your position. You also
    salute during the firing of volleys and the playing of  Taps. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8488"><span id="SPAN-8489">8.6.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-8490">Indoors.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8491"><span id="SPAN-8492">Except for formal
    reporting, salutes are not rendered.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8493"><b id="B-8494"><span id="SPAN-8495">8.7. Military Etiquette.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-8496"><span id="SPAN-8497">Etiquette is defined as
    common, everyday courtesy. The military world, like the civilian world,
    functions more smoothly and pleasantly when members practice good manners.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8498"><span id="SPAN-8499">8.7.1. Simple things
    like saying  please  and  thank you  help the organization run smoother because
    people respond more enthusiastically when asked in a courteous manner to do
    something. They also appreciate knowing their efforts are recognized when told
     thank you. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8500"><span id="SPAN-8501">8.7.2. One of the most valuable habits anyone
    can develop is to be on time for appointments. Granted, sometimes a person
    cannot avoid being late. When this happens, the best course of action is to
    call ahead or to reschedule the appointment. Do not keep others waiting. 8.7.3.
    Address civil service employees properly. As a rule, address them appropriately
    as  Mr.,   Mrs.,   Miss,  or  Ms.  and their last name, unless requested to do
    otherwise. Always address a superior formally. This is especially important in
    most foreign countries where using first names on the job is much more limited
    than in the U.S.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8502"><span id="SPAN-8503">8.7.4. Don t gossip<b id="B-8504"><i id="I-8505">.</i></b>&nbsp;A
    discussion of personal habits, problems, and activities (real or rumored) of
    others often results in quarrels and disputes among people who work together.
    The morale of any unit may suffer because of feuds that arise from gossip. The
    best policy is not to gossip and to discourage others from gossiping.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8506"><span id="SPAN-8507">8.7.5.
    Use proper telephone etiquette<b id="B-8508"><i id="I-8509">.</i></b><i id="I-8510">&nbsp;</i>Always be polite and
    identify yourself and your organization. When an individual is not available to
    take a call, ask:  May I take a message?  or  Is there something I may help you
    with?  If taking a message to return a call, write down the individual's name,
    organization, telephone number, the message, and then pass this information
    along to the intended recipient.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8511"><span id="SPAN-8512">8.7.6. Do not lean or
    sit on desks. Also, do not lean back in a chair or put feet on desks. This type
    of conduct doesn t present a professional military image.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8513"><span id="SPAN-8514">8.7.7. In general, use
    common sense, be considerate of other people, and insist your subordinates do
    the same.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8515"><b id="B-8516"><span id="SPAN-8517">8.8.</span></b><span id="SPAN-8518">&nbsp;<b id="B-8519">Courtesies to Other Services:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8520"><span id="SPAN-8521">8.8.1.
    The collective efforts of the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard
    provide for the defense of the country against aggression. All Services are
    part of the military team; therefore, extend the same military courtesies to
    members of the other Services. While there is a friendly natural rivalry
    between the Services, military courtesies among Services remain the same. Thus,
    the members of the other Services are as much comrades-in-arms as are any
    Airmen.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8522"><span id="SPAN-8523">8.8.2.
    This is equally true of the friendly armed forces of the United Nations. Salute
    all commissioned officers and pay the same respect to the national anthems and
    flags of other nations as rendered the U.S. national anthem and flag. While not
    necessary to learn the identifying insignia of the military grades of all
    nations, you should learn the insignia of the most frequently contacted
    nations, particularly during an overseas assignment or deployment.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8524"><b id="B-8525"><span id="SPAN-8526">8.9. Respect and Recognition:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-8527"><span id="SPAN-8528">8.9.1.<b id="B-8529">&nbsp;Common Acts of Courtesy.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8530"><span id="SPAN-8531">Common acts of courtesy
    among all Air Force personnel aid in maintaining discipline and promoting the
    smooth conduct of affairs in the military establishment. When courtesy falters
    within a unit, discipline ceases to function, and accomplishing the mission is
    endangered. Many of the Air Force courtesies involve the salute. There are,
    however, many other courtesies commonly extended to superiors, subordinates,
    and working associates. Some acts of courtesies include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8532"><span id="SPAN-8533">8.9.1.1. Giving the
    senior person, enlisted or commissioned, the position of honor when walking,
    riding, or sitting with him or her at all times. The junior person takes the
    position to the senior's left.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8534"><span id="SPAN-8535">8.9.1.2. When reporting
    to an officer indoors, knock once and enter when told to do so. Upon entering,
    march to approximately two paces from the officer or desk, halt, salute, and
    report in this manner:  Sir (Ma am), Airman Smith reports as ordered,  or  Sir
    (Ma am), Airman Smith reports.  When the conversation is completed, execute a
    sharp salute and hold until the officer acknowledges the salute, then perform
    the appropriate facing movements and depart.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8536"><span id="SPAN-8537">8.9.1.3. Unless told
    otherwise, rise and stand at attention when a senior official enters or departs
    a room. If more than one person is present, the person who first sees the
    officer calls the group to attention. However, if an officer is already in the
    room who is equal to or has a higher rank than the officer entering the room,
    do not call the room to attention.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8538"><span id="SPAN-8539">8.9.1.4. Military
    personnel enter automobiles and small boats in reverse order of rank. Juniors
    will enter a vehicle first and take their appropriate seat on the senior s
    left. The senior officer will be the last to enter the vehicle and the first to
    leave.</span></p>

    <p id="P-8692"><span id="SPAN-8693">The signal for the start
    of the official duty day is the reveille. Because the time for the start of the
    duty day varies between bases, the commander designates the specified time for
    reveille. If the commander desires, a reveille ceremony may accompany the
    raising of the flag. This ceremony takes place after sunrise near the base
    flagstaff. In the unit area, reveille is normally held using the formation of
    squadron in line. This formation is used when a reveille ceremony is not held
    at the base flagstaff. Procedures for reveille include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8694"><span id="SPAN-8695">8.10.1.1. Shortly before
    the specified time, Airmen march to a pre-designated position near the base
    flagstaff, halt, face toward the flagstaff, and dress. The flag security detail
    arrives at the flagstaff at this time and remains at attention.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8696"><span id="SPAN-8697">8.10.1.2. The unit
    commander (or senior participant) commands  Parade, REST. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8698"><span id="SPAN-8699">8.10.1.3. At the
    specified time for reveille, the unit commander commands  SOUND REVEILLE.  The
    flag detail assumes the position of attention, moves to the flagstaff, and
    attaches the flag to the halyards.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8700"><span id="SPAN-8701">8.10.1.4. After reveille
    is played, the unit commander commands  Squadron, ATTENTION  and  Present, ARMS 
    and then faces the flagstaff and executes present arms. On this signal, the
    national anthem or  To the Colors' is sounded. 8.10.1.5. On the first note of
    the national anthem or  To the Colors,  the flag security detail begins to
    raise the flag briskly. The senior member of the detail holds the flag to keep
    the flag from touching the ground.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8702"><span id="SPAN-8703">8.10.1.6. The unit
    commander holds the salute until the last note of the national anthem or  To
    the Colors' is played. Then he or she executes order arms, faces about, and
    commands  Order, ARMS.  The Airmen are then marched back to the dismissal area.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8704"><span id="SPAN-8705">8.10.2.<b id="B-8706">&nbsp;Raising the Flag:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8707"><span id="SPAN-8708">8.10.2.1. When
    practical, a detail consisting of one NCO and two Airmen hoists the flag. This
    detail should carry sidearms if the special equipment of the guard includes
    sidearms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8709"><span id="SPAN-8710">8.10.2.2. The detail
    forms in line with the NCO carrying the flag in the center. The detail then
    marches to the flagstaff and halts, and the flag is attached to the halyards.
    The flag is always raised and lowered from the leeward side of the flagstaff.
    The two Airmen attend the halyards, taking a position facing the staff to hoist
    the flag without entangling the halyards.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8711"><span id="SPAN-8712">8.10.2.3. The NCO
    continues to hold the flag until hoisted clear of his or her grasp, taking
    particular care that no portion of the flag touches the ground. When the flag
    is clear of the grasp, the NCO comes to attention and executes present arms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8713"><span id="SPAN-8714">8.10.2.4. On the last
    note of the national anthem,  To the Colors,  or after the flag has been
    hoisted to the staff head, all members of the detail execute order arms on
    command of the senior member. The halyards are then secured to the cleat of the
    staff or, if appropriate, the flag is lowered to half-staff and the halyards
    are secured. The detail is formed again and then marches to the dismissal area.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8715"><span id="SPAN-8716">8.10.3.<b id="B-8717">&nbsp;Retreat Ceremony:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8718"><span id="SPAN-8719">8.10.3.1. The retreat
    ceremony<i id="I-8720">&nbsp;</i>serves a twofold purpose: signals the end of the official
    duty day and serves as a ceremony for paying respect to the U.S. flag. Because
    the time for the end of the duty day varies, the commander designates the time
    for the retreat ceremony. The retreat ceremony may take place at the squadron
    area, on the base parade ground, or near the base flagstaff. If conducted
    within the squadron area, the ceremony usually does not involve a parade. If
    conducted at the base parade ground, retreat may be part of the parade
    ceremony. For retreat ceremonies conducted at the base flagstaff, the units
    participating may be formed in line or massed, depending on the size and number
    of units and the space available.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8721"><span id="SPAN-8722">8.10.3.2. Shortly before
    the specified time for retreat, the band and Airmen participating in the
    ceremony are positioned facing the flagstaff and dressed. If marching to and
    from the flagstaff, the band precedes the Airmen participating in the ceremony.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8723"><span id="SPAN-8724">8.10.3.3. If the band
    and Airmen march to the flagstaff, a flag security detail also marches to the
    flagstaff and halts, and the senior member gives the command  Parade, REST  to
    the security detail.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8725"><span id="SPAN-8726">8.10.3.4. As soon as the
    Airmen are dressed, the commander commands  Parade, REST.  The commander then
    faces the flagstaff, assumes the position of the Airmen, and waits for the
    specified time for retreat.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8727"><span id="SPAN-8728">8.10.3.5. At the
    specified time, the commander orders the bandleader to sound retreat by
    commanding  SOUND RETREAT. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8729"><span id="SPAN-8730">8.10.3.6. The band plays
    retreat. If a band is not present, recorded music is played over the base
    public address system. During the playing of retreat, junior members of the
    flag security detail assume the position of attention and move to the flagstaff
    to arrange the halyards for proper lowering of the flag. Once the halyards are
    arranged, the junior members of the flag security detail execute parade rest in
    unison.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8731"><span id="SPAN-8732">8.10.3.7. Uniformed
    military members not assigned to a formation face the flag (if visible) or the
    music and assume the position of parade rest on the first note of retreat. Upon
    completion of retreat, they should assume the position of attention and salute
    on the first note of the national anthem or  To the Colors. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8733"><span id="SPAN-8734">8.10.3.8. After the band
    plays retreat, the commander faces about and commands  Squadron (Group, etc.),
    ATTENTION.  8.10.3.9. The commander then commands  Present, ARMS.  As soon as
    the Airmen execute present arms, the commander faces to the front and also
    assumes present arms. The members of the flag security detail execute present
    arms on command of the commander.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8735"><span id="SPAN-8736">8.10.3.10. The band
    plays the national anthem, or the bugler plays  To the Colors.  The junior
    members of the flag security detail lower the flag slowly and with dignity.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8737"><span id="SPAN-8738">8.10.3.11. The commander
    executes order arms when the last note of the national anthem or  To the
    Colors' is played and the flag is securely grasped. The commander faces about,
    gives the Airmen  Order, ARMS,  and then faces to the front.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8739"><span id="SPAN-8740">8.10.3.12. The flag
    security detail folds the flag as illustrated in Figure 8.17. The senior member
    of the detail remains at attention while the flag is folded unless needed to
    control the flag.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-8741"><span id="SPAN-8742">8.10.3.13. When the flag
    is folded, the flag security detail, with the senior member on the right and
    the flag bearer in the center, marches to a position three paces from the
    commander. (<b id="B-8743">Note:<i id="I-8744">&nbsp;</i></b>In an informal ceremony, the detail
    marches three paces from the officer of the day.) The senior member salutes and

    so the two are completed at the same time. 8.10.4.4. The senior member commands
    the detail  Order, ARMs' when the flag is low enough to be received. If at

    to the flag,  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the U.S. of America and to the
    Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty
    and justice for all  should be rendered by standing at attention and facing the
    flag. When not in uniform, persons should remove any non-religious headdress
    with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand being
    over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and
    render the military salute if outdoors and indoors if in formation and wearing
    appropriate headdress. If indoors and without headdress, military members
    should stand at attention, remain silent, and face the flag. Military members
    in uniform do not recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.</span></p>

    <p id="P-8768"><span id="SPAN-8769">Although several flag
    folding ceremony options are offered by various national interest groups, these
    are not official Air Force ceremonies. According to Title 4, United States
    Code, no specific meaning is assigned to the folds of the flag. The Air Force
    developed a script that provides a historical perspective on the flag. There
    are no ceremonies in the Air Force requiring a script to be read when the flag
    is folded. However, when a flag folding ceremony is desired and conducted by
    Air Force personnel at any location, on or off an installation, this script is
    the only one that may be used. Refer back to Figure 8.17 for the proper method
    for folding the U.S. flag and Figure 8.18 for a copy of this script.</span></p>

    inspiration for millions of citizens.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8780"><span id="SPAN-8781">Born on June 14, 1777,
    the Second Continental Congress determined that the flag of the U.S. be 13
    stripes, alternating between 7 red and 6 white; and that the union be 13 stars,
    white in a blue field representing a new constellation. (1)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8782"><span id="SPAN-8783">Between 1777 and 1960,
    the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before you
    today. The 13 horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the
    stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic
    as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and
    innocence; and blue represents vigilance, perseverance, and justice. (1)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8784"><span id="SPAN-8785">Traditionally, a symbol
    of liberty, the American flag has carried the message of freedom, and inspired
    Americans, both at home and abroad.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8786"><span id="SPAN-8787">In 1814, Francis Scott
    Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British
    shelling of Baltimore's Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star
    Spangled Banner. (2)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8788"><span id="SPAN-8789">In 1892 the flag
    inspired Francis Bellamy to write the  Pledge of Allegiance,  our most famous
    flag salute and patriotic oath. (2)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8790"><span id="SPAN-8791">In July 1969 the
    American flag was  flown  in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the
    surface of the moon. (2)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8792"><span id="SPAN-8793">Today, our flag flies on
    constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin
    flash of our aircraft in harm's way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it
    flies in the heart of every Airman who serves our great Nation. The sun never
    sets on our U.S. Air Force, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish. (2)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8794"><span id="SPAN-8795">Since 1776, no
    generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending
    freedom  Today's Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others
    won for us for generations to come.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-8796"><span id="SPAN-8797">By displaying the flag
    and giving it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag and express our
    gratitude to those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom,
    at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20th century, Airmen have proudly
    flown the flag in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world. It
    is their responsibility our responsibility to continue to protect and preserve
    the rights, privileges, and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today. The
    U.S. flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and the
    pride and patriotism we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy as a beacon
    of hope to one and all. Long may it wave.</span></p>

    Air Force has many different types of ceremonies that are unique customs of our
    military profession. Some of these ceremonies are very formal and elaborate,
    while others are quite simple and personal. Award, decoration, promotion,
    reenlistment, and retirement ceremonies are a few of the most common within the

    Ceremony.&nbsp;</span></b><span id="SPAN-8821">An award ceremony
    affords an opportunity to recognize a member's accomplishments. The commander
    or other official determines whether to present an award at a formal ceremony
    or to present it informally. Many units present awards during commander's call.
    Because there are no specific guidelines for an award presentation, commanders
    and supervisors must ensure the presentation method reflects the significance
    of the award.</span></p>

    meritorious service, outstanding achievement, or heroism. A formal and
    dignified ceremony is necessary to preserve the integrity and value of
    decorations. When possible, the commander should personally present the
    decoration. Regardless of where the presentation is conducted, the ceremony is
    conducted at the earliest possible date after approval of the decoration. All
    military participants and attendees should wear the uniform specified by the
    host. If in doubt, the Service Dress rather than the Airman Battle Uniform is

    decoration ceremonies may differ slightly from one unit to another, they
    normally begin by announcing  ATTENTION TO ORDERS.  All members in attendance
    stand at attention and face the commander and the recipient. The commander s
    assistant reads the citation while the commander and recipient stand at
    attention. After the citation is read, the commander and recipient face each
    other, and the commander affixes the medal on the individual's uniform. The
    commander next extends personal congratulations and a handshake while presenting
    the decoration certificate. The recipient salutes the commander, and the
    commander returns the salute to conclude the formal part of the ceremony.
    Attendees are then invited to personally congratulate the recipient and enjoy
    any refreshments provided.</span></p>

    ceremonies. Because most promotions are effective the first day of the month,
    the promotion ceremony is customarily conducted on the last duty day before the

    military service. Each commander makes sure members leave with a tangible

    with the assurance they will continue to be a part of the Air Force family in
    retirement. Anyone involved in planning a retirement should consult AFI

    ceremony to recognize their contributions. They must offer the retiring member
    the courtesy of a formal ceremony in keeping with the customs and traditions of
    the Service. If possible, a general officer conducts the ceremony. Ceremonies held
    as part of formal military formations, such as retreats and parades, are

    of retirement, a U.S. Flag, the Air Force retired lapel button, Certificate of
    Appreciation for Service in the Armed Forces of the U.S., and appropriate
    awards, decorations, honors, and letters of appreciation. If possible, avoid
    using  dummy  elements that the member cannot keep. Family members and friends
    should be invited and encouraged to attend the ceremony. Furthermore, the
    member's spouse is customarily presented with a certificate of appreciation for
    the support and sacrifices made during the member's career.</span></p>

    format had its beginnings in the Air Corps when General Henry H.  Hap  Arnold
    held his famous wingdings. The association of Army Air Corps personnel with the

    drill, Air Force organizations are divided into elements, flights, squadrons,
    groups, and wings. Drill consists of certain movements by which the flight or
    squadron is moved in an orderly manner from one formation to another or from
    one place to another. Standards such as the 24-inch step, cadence of 100 to 120
    steps per minute, distance, and interval were established to ensure movements
    are executed with order and precision. The task of each person is to learn
    these movements and execute each part exactly as described. Individuals must
    also learn to adapt their own movements to those of the group. Everyone in the
    formation must move together on command.</span></p>

    <p id="P-9074"><span id="SPAN-9075">While the term
     ceremony  was defined earlier in this chapter, you should be note that certain
    ceremonies use drill. In these events, ceremonies not only honor distinguished
    persons and recognize special events, but also demonstrate the proficiency and
    training state of the Airmen. Ceremonies are an extension of drill activities.
    The precision marching, promptness in responding to commands, and teamwork
    developed on the drill field determine the appearance and performance of the
    group in ceremonies. The following paragraphs cover only the basic aspects of
    drill. For more information, see AFMAN 36-2203,<i id="I-9076">&nbsp;Drill and Ceremonies</i>.</span></p>

    drill command is an oral order that usually has two parts: the preparatory
    command and the command of execution. The preparatory command explains what the
    movement will be. When calling a unit to attention or halting a unit's march,
    the preparatory command includes the unit designation. In the command  Flight,

    line. Place the heels as near each other as the conformation of the body
    permits and ensure the feet are turned out equally to form a 45-degree angle.
    Keep the legs straight without stiffening or locking the knees. The body is erect
    with hips level, chest lifted, back arched, and shoulders square and even. Arms
    hang straight down alongside the body without stiffness and the wrists are
    straight with the forearms. Place thumbs, which are resting along the first
    joint of the forefinger, along the seams of the trousers or sides of the skirt.
    Hands are cupped (but not clenched as a fist) with palms facing the leg. The
    head is kept erect and held straight to the front, with the chin drawn slightly
    so the axis of the head and neck is vertical; eyes are to the front with the
    line of sight parallel to the ground. The weight of the body rests equally on
    the heels and balls of both feet. Silence and immobility are required.</span></p>

    honors for Regular Air Force, retired members, and veterans of the U.S. Air
    Force. The Base Honor Guard Program is a mandatory Air Force program and is the
    responsibility of the installation commander. Members are usually volunteers
    from the installation host and tenant units, with selections generally coming
    from the installation's Airman Basic to Technical Sergeant pool. The base honor

    Headquarters Command, U.S. Air Force, directed the creation of an elite
    ceremonial unit comparable to those of the other Services. The first base honor
    guard was activated within the 1100th Air Police
    Squadron,&nbsp;Bolling&nbsp;Field, Washington District of Columbia, and was
    responsible for maintaining an Air Force ceremonial capability in the National
    Capitol Region. However, other Air Force installations worldwide approached

    <p id="P-9260"><span id="SPAN-9261">Protocol is the set of
    rules prescribing good manners in official life and in ceremonies involving
    governments and nations and their representatives. Protocol is an
    internationally recognized system of courtesy and respect. Protocol for the
    military and government agencies is a code of traditional precedence, courtesy,
    and etiquette in matters of military, diplomatic, official, and celebratory
    ceremonies. Military protocol encompasses the knowledge, accumulation and
    application of established service customs. In modern practice, protocol
    combines the traditional codes of conduct with contemporary etiquette and
    courtesy. The goal is to avoid disputes, insults, embarrassment, and
    distractions by following a set of objective and generally accepted criteria.
    As times change, so do the manners of the people; protocol must keep pace with
    developing official life. Though only a guide, the following sections will help

    military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary of the Air
    Force for International Affairs (SAF/IA); and (4) visitor or group designated
    by the commander. Also, persons of lower rank, but in certain positions, may be
    given DV status. At base level, for example, colonels, civilian equivalents,
    and the Command Chief Master Sergeant may be designated as DV by the commander.
    Many distinguished dignitaries, military and civilian, domestic and foreign,
    visit Air Force installations for festive occasions and official business.
    Reducing the frequency of ceremonial honors rendered official visitors at field
    installations is of high importance. In the interest of economy and efficiency,
    such ceremonies as parades, honor cordons, motorcades, and other ceremonies
    that involve large numbers of Airmen and equipment will be held to an absolute
    minimum when officials entitled to such honors visit military installations. In
    general, full honors are reserved for statutory appointees and general or flag
    officers of the military Services, foreign dignitaries, and occasions when
    ceremonies promote international good will. The installation commander
    determines which types of honors are rendered. Enlisted personnel are
    frequently appointed as project NCOs for ceremonies, officials at social
    events, or escorts for visiting DVs.</span></p>

    appoint officers to serve him. Those appointed were accountants, builders,
    crafts people, teachers, scribes, and others conducting the daily kingdom
    affairs. The system worked so well it was incorporated into the Swedish Army as
    a way to establish and maintain a cohesive, disciplined, and well-trained

    customs and courtesies, providing an extensive but not all-inclusive outline of
    what makes the Air Force and the people special. These ceremonies represent
    many customs and traditions of our Air Force heritage. They are very real
    aspects of life, and, in the aggregate, form the special culture and lifestyle

    <p id="P-9389"><span id="SPAN-9390">9.1.1. Noncommissioned
    officers (NCO) are the backbone of the Air Force. The organization's success or
    failure, strengths or weaknesses can be directly related to the effectiveness
    of its NCOs. This chapter begins by discussing the philosophy, purpose, and
    structure of the enlisted force. Next, it explores the ranks, roles,
    responsibilities and developmental levels for Junior Enlisted Airmen, NCOs and
    senior noncommissioned officers. In addition, it briefly describes those
    special positions entrusted to senior NCO, such as Air Force Career Field
    Manager, first sergeant, Command Chief Master Sergeant, and Chief Master
    Sergeant of the Air Force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9391"><span id="SPAN-9392">9.1.2.
    Regardless of rank, every enlisted Airman supports the Profession of Arms to
    defend the interests of the state, by force and death, when required. This
    charge is unique to the military profession, and is a calling that requires
    devotion to service and willingness to sacrifice far beyond that required in
    other professions. The military as a profession and its core values and
    supporting ideas are concepts that epitomize the  NCO.  Finally, the purpose
    for including this chapter within AFH 1,&nbsp;<i id="I-9393">Airman</i>&nbsp;is to provide
    enlisted Airmen reference material to support their promotion tests.</span></p>

    <p id="P-9398"><b id="B-9399"><span id="SPAN-9400">9.2. Philosophy:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-9401"><span id="SPAN-9402">9.2.1.
    The enlisted force is a diverse corps of functionally and operationally
    specialized Airmen in the Profession of Arms. Despite the differences across
    functional and operational lines, there is a compelling need for a deliberate
    and common approach to force development, career progression, and the
    assumption of increased supervisory and leadership responsibilities. To best
    leverage our&nbsp;resources&nbsp;we must have a consistent, well-defined set of
    expectations, standards, and opportunities for growth for&nbsp;<i id="I-9403">all&nbsp;</i>Airmen,
    regardless of rank or specialty. The enlisted force structure provides this
    consistency and common approach. It defines us as&nbsp;<i id="I-9404">Airmen first</i>,&nbsp;<i id="I-9405">specialists
    second</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9406"><span id="SPAN-9407">9.2.2.
    All elements of the enlisted force structure reflect the Air Force core values
    (Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do), and are
    essential to the profession of arms. The core values are the basis for Air
    Force policies, guidance, and overall focus.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9408"><b id="B-9409"><span id="SPAN-9410">9.3. Purpose of the Force Structure:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-9411"><span id="SPAN-9412">9.3.1. The enlisted
    force structure provides the framework for a force structure that best meets
    mission requirements, while developing institutional and occupational
    competencies.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9413"><span id="SPAN-9414">9.3.2. The enlisted
    force structure defines the tiers, ranks, terms of address, roles,
    expectations, key positions and approved duty titles for the enlisted force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9415"><span id="SPAN-9416">9.3.3. Additionally, the
    enlisted force structure provides a framework for supervisors as they set
    standards during initial feedback sessions, evaluate progress during mid-term
    feedback sessions, and document performance on annual reports.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9417"><b id="B-9418"><span id="SPAN-9419">9.4. Air Force Leadership Levels.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-9420"><span id="SPAN-9421">9.4.1. The Air Force
    operates in a dynamic global context across multiple domains requiring
    leadership skills at three distinct levels: tactical expertise, operational
    competence, and strategic vision. These levels emphasize a different mix of
    qualities and experience. The leadership level at which an Airman operates
    determines the institutional competencies (see paragraph 9.20) required to lead
    Airmen in mission accomplishment. As shown in Figure 9.1, as Airmen progress
    from the tactical expertise to strategic vision leadership levels, emphasis on
    the use of institutional competencies shifts from personal to organizational,
    with a generally consistent focus on people/team competencies. The nature and
    scope of leadership challenges as well as preferred leadership methods differ
    based on the level of leadership and duties. In addition, these levels apply
    across the entire spectrum of the enlisted force structure (Figure 9.2).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9422"><span id="SPAN-9423">9.4.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-9424">Tactical Expertise Level.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9425"><span id="SPAN-9426">This
    level is predominantly direct and face-to-face and focused on personal
    competencies. At the tactical expertise level, Airmen gain a general
    understanding of team leadership and an appreciation for organization
    leadership. They master their core duty skills, develop experiences in applying
    those skills, and begin to acquire the knowledge and experience that will
    produce the qualities essential to effective leadership. Airmen at the tactical
    expertise level gain the training, education and experience to become the Air
    Force's primary technicians and specialists. They learn about themselves as
    leaders and how their leadership acumen can affect others through the use of
    ethical leadership.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9427"><span id="SPAN-9428">They assimilate into the
    Air Force culture and adopt the Air Force Core Values. Airmen at this level
    focus on honing followership abilities, motivating subordinates and influencing
    peers to accomplish the mission while developing a warrior ethos. They learn
    about themselves and their impact on others in roles as both follower and
    leader in addition to developing their communication skills. The primary focus
    at the tactical expertise level is accomplishing the missions as effectively
    and efficiently as possible using available personnel and resources.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-9447"><span id="SPAN-9448">The
    full-spectrum of institutional competencies is balanced across the operational
    competence leadership level. At this level, Airmen understand the broader Air Force
    perspective and the integration of diverse people and capabilities in
    operational execution. They transition from specialists to leaders with a
    broader enterprise perspective who understand Air Force operational
    capabilities. Based on a thorough understanding of themselves as leaders and
    followers, Airmen apply an understanding of organizational and team dynamics.
    They lead teams by developing and inspiring others, taking care of people, and
    taking advantage of diversity. They foster collaborative relationships through
    building teams and coalitions, especially within large organizations, and
    negotiate with others, often external to the organization. Airmen operating at
    this leadership level normally work below the major command or Headquarters Air
    Force levels. The majority of enlisted Airmen operate at the tactical expertise
    and operational competence levels.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9449"><span id="SPAN-9450">9.4.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-9451">Strategic Vision Level.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9452"><span id="SPAN-9453">At
    this level, Airmen combine highly developed personal and people/team
    institutional competencies to apply broad organizational competencies. They
    develop a deep understanding of Air Force capabilities and how Airmen achieve
    synergistic results and desired effects with their operational capabilities.
    They also understand how the Air Force operates within joint, multinational,
    and interagency relationships. At the strategic vision level, an Airman employs
    military capabilities, applying the operational and strategic arts with a
    thorough understanding of unit capabilities, the Air Force at large, and joint
    and coalition forces. They have an enterprise perspective with a thorough
    understanding of the structure and relationships needed to accomplish strategic
    objectives. The strategic vision level focuses on the effects an Airman can
    have across a major command, a theater, the Air Force, or even other Services
    or the Department of Defense. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force
    (CMSAF) and few other senior NCOs assigned to higher headquarters operate at
    this level.</span></p>

    Roles.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-9457"><span id="SPAN-9458">The
    enlisted force structure is comprised of three distinct and separate tiers,
    each correlating to increased levels of education, training, and experience,
    which build increasing levels of proficiency. The tiers are Junior Enlisted
    Airmen, Noncommissioned Officer, and Senior Noncommissioned Officer, with
    multiple ranks in each tier. Each rank includes an official abbreviation and
    term of address, as outlined below. Unofficial terms for ranks are not
    appropriate terms of address (e.g., Tech, Senior, etc.); however, Airmen senior
    or equivalent to the member may use first names and/or call signs. The three
    tiers correlate to increased leadership and managerial responsibilities, with
    each tier building on the responsibilities of the previous one. Therefore, senior
    NCOs are expected to have mastered NCO responsibilities. Likewise, NCOs are
    expected to have mastered Junior Enlisted Airmen responsibilities. The primary
    goal in each tier is mission accomplishment.</span></p>

    accessions enter the Air Force in this tier (airman basic, airman, or airman
    first class), and focus on adapting to military requirements, being part of the
    profession of arms, achieving occupational proficiency, and learning how to be
    highly productive members of the Air Force. In this tier, Airmen prepare for
    increased responsibilities and ensure they are trained, qualified, and ready to
    operate, both at home station and in an expeditionary environment. Junior

    rank and hold strategic leadership positions with tremendous influence at all
    levels of the Air Force. They continue to develop personal leadership and
    management skills to prepare for ever increasing positions of responsibility.
    They are charged with mentoring and developing junior enlisted personnel and
    strongly influence the professional development of junior officers. They bring
    substantial operational and occupational experience as well as strong
    institutional skills to their organizations and assigned tasks. All newly
    selected Regular Air Force (RegAF) Chief Master Sergeants will attend the Chief
    Master Sergeant Leadership Course. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard
    Chief Master Sergeants will apply for attendance through their commands. Chief
    Master Sergeants serve in key leadership positions such as Combatant Command
    Senior Enlisted Leader, Command Chief Master Sergeant, Group Superintendent,
    PME Commandants, Functional and Career Field Managers. The written abbreviation

    Master Sergeant of the Air Force.</b>&nbsp;The CMSAF is the senior enlisted
    leader of the Air Force and takes precedence over all enlisted members. The
    CMSAF provides leadership to the enlisted force and advises the Chief of Staff
    of the Air Force, Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman Joint chief of Staff,
    and the Secretary of Defense on enlisted matters. The CMSAF communicates with
    the force, serves on boards and committees for numerous organizations affecting
    Airmen, testifies before congress, and is the Air Force career field manager
    for command chief master sergeants and group superintendents. The CMSAF also
    consults with sister service senior enlisted advisors on issues affecting all
    enlisted members; engages with foreign military leadership regarding theater
    security cooperation and partner nation development efforts; represents the Air
    Force to the American public, professional organizations and the media; and
    manages the Air Force Order of the Sword Program. The written abbreviation is
     CMSAF  and the official term of address is  Chief Master Sergeant of the Air
    Force  or  Chief.  The idea of creating a CMSAF position surfaced as early as
    1964 when the Air Force Association's Airman Advisory Council presented the
    idea. At that time, Air Force leadership rejected the proposal, fearing that
    such a position would undermine the formal chain of command. Purposeful action
    did not come until 1966 when Congressman Mendel Rivers introduced a bill that
    would mandate each of the Services to appoint a senior NCO. Congressman Rivers
    became convinced that the Air Force needed to follow the example of the Marine
    Corps (which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in
    1957) and the Army (which had created the position of Sergeant Major of the
    Army in 1965) and appoint a senior enlisted advisor to the Chief of Staff of
    the Air Force. Although the Rivers bill never passed, the Air Force recognized
    the tremendous support behind the proposal. On 24 October 1966, Chief of Staff
    of the Air Force General John P. McConnell announced the newly created position
    of CMSAF. In April 1967, Chief Paul W. Airey became the first to wear the
    unique insignia with the wreath around the star. Over the next decade, support
    for the office grew among senior leaders and within the enlisted force. Today,
    the CMSAF wears the chevron depicted in Figure 9.3. To date,</span><span id="SPAN-9514">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-9515">17 individuals have previously served in this office. The present

    Airey enlisted in the Army Air Forces as a radio operator on 16 November 1942.
    By the height of World War II, he was serving as an aerial gunner aboard B-24
    bombers. While in Europe, Airey and his crew were shot down over Vienna,
    Austria, captured, and held prisoner by the Germans from July 1944 to May 1945.
    During the Korean conflict, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for creating a
    means of constructing equipment from salvaged parts, improving corrosion
    control of sensitive radio and radar components. Following the war, Airey took
    the job of first sergeant, a position he later said was one of the most
    important in the Air Force. He subsequently served as first sergeant for six
    squadrons at four bases over the next 12 years before being appointed to the
    highest NCO position.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9527"><span id="SPAN-9528">9.5.3.4.1.2. Upon
    assuming his new responsibilities, CMSAF Airey began tackling the problem of
    personnel retention, an issue he identified as one of the greatest challenges
    he faced. The first-term reenlistment rate was the lowest it had been in 12
    years, but Airey did not attribute the great decline to the unpopularity of the
    war in Vietnam. He felt it was the consequence of  poor pay, numerous remote
    assignments, good civilian employment opportunities, and an inequitable
    promotion system.  He became an advisor to a committee to investigate and
    recommend a more equitable system. His efforts helped produce the Weighted
    Airman Promotion System which was adopted in 1970, eliminating local enlisted
    promotion boards and equalizing promotion opportunities across career fields.
    In retirement, Airey continued to be an enlisted advocate and spoke to Airmen
    around the force. CMSAF Airey died in 2009.</span></p>

    22, after working a variety of jobs to help support his mother and pay his
    tuition at a private preparatory school, he was drafted into the Army Air
    Corps. Serving as an armament and gunnery instructor, he taught cadets to
    fieldstrip and reassemble their weapons and to synchronize firing guns through
    aircraft propellers. He transferred to the personnel career field in 1945 and
    advanced to the grade of Staff Sergeant before his February 1946 discharge from
    active duty. During the Korean War, Harlow was recalled to active duty, holding
    various positions in the personnel career field. At 16 years of service, he was
    promoted to Chief Master Sergeant and was the personnel Sergeant Major for
    Headquarters United States European Command and the Sergeant Major for the
    Executive Services Division, Office of the Vice Chief of Staff.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9537"><span id="SPAN-9538">9.5.3.4.2.2. As the
    second to take the reins, CMSAF Harlow continued to cut a path through the
    misunderstanding, confusion, and mistrust that surrounded the CMSAF Ever
    vigilant, he campaigned for and refined the newly established Weighted Airman
    Promotion System, garnered continued flight&nbsp;pay&nbsp;for NCOs attending
    in-residence PME and worked toward equal per diem for enlisted and officers.
    During Vietnam, he directed his attention to where he felt it was most needed:
    young Airmen and their issues, including racial tension, assignment concerns,
    and promotion problems. Known for his no-nonsense approach and keen ability to
    listen, Harlow advised the Chief of Staff of the Air Force on matters of true
    concern to the enlisted force. While many of his recommendations did not result
    in policy changes during his tenure, he planted the seeds for future change.
    After retiring, Chief Harlow was a strong lobbyist for enlisted equality. CMSAF

    the Great Depression and the dust bowl years. The patriotism he developed
    during his childhood was called on when he was drafted into the Army's combat
    infantry in 1945 during the effort to reconstitute the number of soldiers
    driving through France. After training and deployment
    times,&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;arrived in France a month before the war in Europe
    ended. His unit assumed responsibility for negotiating the repatriation of displaced
    Soviets. From there,&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;separated from the service for civilian
    life. After a few months spent missing the camaraderie, he reenlisted for a
    brief stint in the Army. In 1947, he joined the Army Air Forces, serving first
    as a clerk and later a personnel specialist. Upon his promotion to Senior
    Master Sergeant in September 1958, he was among the first group of Air Force
    enlisted members to wear the super grades of Senior Master Sergeant and Chief

    <p id="P-9547"><span id="SPAN-9548">9.5.3.4.3.2.<b id="B-9549">&nbsp;</b>Once
    assigned to the Pentagon, CMSAF&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;found the enlisted force
    struggling through the development of a new Air Force. After talking with
    several base officials, it was determined that the Air Force needed to develop
    their NCOs like they did their officers. So&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;placed concerns
    for NCO professional development in the forefront of discussion at the
    Pentagon. His persistence paid off when the first senior NCO academy was
    approved by Congress in 1972. The Academy officially opened its doors in
    January 1973; however, before the Academy opened its doors, the original plan
    was to restrict its attendance to first sergeants. In the
    end,&nbsp;Kisling&nbsp;won the battle of making professional development
    available to all senior NCOs. His concern for such enlisted issues as housing,
    pay, promotions, education and training, and assignments earned him the respect
    of his peers and the nickname,  the GI's man in Washington.

    the war-related industries town of Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1949, he joined
    the newly created United States Air Force as an aircraft maintainer
    specializing in hydraulics. His first duty station found him at the leading
    edge of United States Air Force integration efforts, as one of the first
    African-Americans to join the unit. Barnes' unit was flying Korean War support
    missions. Unbeknownst to others in his squadron, a crew pal taught him the art
    of flight engineering and let him fly resupply and medical evacuation missions.
    By his tour's end, Barnes had gained flight engineer certification, accumulated
    750 flight hours over enemy territory and earned the Air Medal. He was the
    first CMSAF with direct Vietnam experience and the first African-American to
    serve in the highest enlisted post of a military service. The Chief of Staff of

    <p id="P-9559"><span id="SPAN-9560">9.5.3.4.4.2. CMSAF Barnes' notable
    contribution came in the area that inspired his greatest passion and ranked
    among his largest challenges: working to ensure equality among the ranks and
    races. He took great pride in the part he played in bringing about the Air
    Force Social Actions Program in 1969. He labored to eliminate barriers for
    women and convince the Air Force to use them in nontraditional roles. He
    understood the value of continuing to educate Airmen and believed no one should
    advance in rank without PME, working to establish the service's firm commitment
    to enlisted PME. Recognized throughout the force for his ability to communicate
    with anyone, Barnes made listening to Airmen a priority. At the beginning of
    his tenure, the question most asked of Barnes was,  What programs will you
    implement for the blacks?   The answer was  None ,  Barnes recalls.  I told
    them I work for all blue suiters.  After his retirement, Barnes remained
    actively engaged in Air Force issues. CMSAF Barnes died in 2003.</span></p>

    continued to raise confidence and shift attitudes within the force. He is
    credited with securing a policy that allowed Senior Airman to transport their

    solid step toward improving quality of life. He educated the force in order to
    eliminate the stereotypes and prejudices working against equal opportunities
    for minorities and women. Finally,&nbsp;<span id="SPAN-9586">Gaylor</span>&nbsp;promoted
    leadership. He traveled extensively, talking to Airmen about taking pride in

    Kansas, and college at St. Benedicts College in Atchison and St. Ambrose
    College in Davenport, Iowa. He seriously considered a vocation in the
    priesthood, but in 1951, during the height of the Korean War, he enlisted in
    the United States Air Force as a radar operator. When the war ended, the Air
    Force had too many operators and needed military training instructors. McCoy
    volunteered and, with only 6 years of active duty experience, found himself in
    charge of five groups of training instructors. He continued working within the
    PME system, serving as NCO preparatory school commandant and as an NCO academy
    instructor before returning to the personnel training field in 1973. A year
    later he was selected as one of the United States Air Force's 12 Outstanding
    Airmen of the Year. He then became Strategic Air Command's first senior
    enlisted advisor. While there, McCoy was a member of the Air Force Management
    Improvement Group, chaired by CMSAF Barnes, which formed to discuss management
    issues and propose solutions. As a result, enlisted PME expanded into five
    phases.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9597"><span id="SPAN-9598">9.5.3.4.6.2. With the public still
    questioning the military involvement in Vietnam, the Air Force was experiencing
    the lowest recruiting year ever; retention rates were also dropping when CMSAF
    McCoy took office. His first challenge was to improve those numbers. In late
    1979, along with former CMSAF&nbsp;<span id="SPAN-9599">Kisling</span>, he
    testified before Congress that people were not reenlisting in the Air Force
    because they could not make ends meet on enlisted pay. McCoy worked with
    recruiters to get the right people in the Air Force and sought to improve the
    PME system from basic training to the NCO and senior NCO level. During his tour
    as CMSAF, the Stripes for Exceptional Performers Program was instituted to
    provide incentive and an alternate promotion option for enlisted members. In
    addition to visiting Airmen, he placed great value on being involved with the
    Pentagon staff. He expanded the list of boards and conferences where he
    believed the CMSAF should have a role. In retirement, McCoy remains at the

    out of a sense of patriotism and a desire to grow and develop, Arthur
    "Bud" L. Andrews enlisted in the Air Force. During basic training,
    his training instructor asked for volunteers to serve as APs. Thinking AP meant
     air police,  Andrews raised his hand. As it turned out, the training
    instructor wanted area policemen. He spent the next 3 months picking up
    cigarette butts outside the barracks. He eventually had an opportunity to enter
    the military police force, where he served most of the next 14 years. In 1959,
    while working as an investigator, Andrews was credited with solving a murder
    committed by an Airman Second Class. By 1970, Andrews had served tours in
    Morocco, Thailand, and Vietnam; became a first sergeant; and was promoted to
    the rank of Senior Master Sergeant. During his career he spent a decade as a

    <p id="P-9609"><span id="SPAN-9610">9.5.3.4.7.2. Upon assuming his new
    position, CMSAF Andrews' top priority could be described as getting back to
    basics. He believed the most vexing problems (such as terms of pay, benefits,
    recruitment, and retention) had been addressed and were evolving to meet
    Airmen's needs. While he continued to advise the Chief of Staff of the Air
    Force on quality-of-life improvements, he began to focus on cultural change. He
    felt it was time for Airmen to  think&nbsp;<i id="I-9611">we</i>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<i id="I-9612">me,
    me, me</i>.  He wanted people to focus on  how we re supposed to dress, act,
    and react toward subordinates and superiors, and how we re supposed to do our
    jobs.  He challenged NCOs to  take care of their people and to accomplish the
    mission.  He further suggested that NCOs look at themselves if they were
    dissatisfied with their jobs. He dispelled the days of  leadership by stress 
    and applauded PME for creating a smarter force. Andrews believed the CMSAF
    needed to know the issues firsthand, which kept him traveling extensively
    around the Air Force. CMSAF Andrews died in 1996.</span></p>

    ground weather equipment operator. His first assignment at Wiesbaden Air Base,
    Germany, brought him into an experimental program to cross train as a weather
    observer. That experiment led to a career. In 1960, he became the youngest 7-skill
    level in his career field and continued to excel. While the chief observer for
    the 7th Weather Squadron in Heidelberg, Germany, he was quickly promoted to
    Senior Master Sergeant, and at age 31, Parish made Chief Master Sergeant. He
    was a member of the first senior NCO academy class, and was selected as the Air
    Weather Service Senior Enlisted Advisor in 1973. He returned to Germany in 1976
    as the Consolidated Base Personnel Office Personnel Sergeant Major, and in 1977
    became the senior enlisted advisor for the United States Air Forces in Europe,
    where he established the United States Air Forces in Europe First Sergeant of

    <p id="P-9624"><span id="SPAN-9625">9.5.3.4.8.2. CMSAF Parish tackled a range
    of enlisted personnel issues during his tenure. One such issue was the
    fixed-phase point for promotion to Senior Airman, which would promote qualified
    Airmen to Senior Airman at a set point in their initial enlistment, allowing them
    a chance to be selected for Staff Sergeant during their first enlistment. He
    also obtained Chief of Staff of the Air Force approval to allow flight line
    personnel to wear a functional badge on their uniform, which led to United
    States Air Force members in all specialties being able to wear functional
    badges identifying their career fields. He also obtained Chief of Staff of the
    Air Force approval to establish the John&nbsp;<span id="SPAN-9626">Levitow</span>&nbsp;Award
    for each level of PME and to implement the First Sergeant of the Year Program
    Air Force-wide. He was known as a straight shooter who did not waste time
    trying to figure out what people wanted to hear. Instead, he told them what
    they needed to hear. To Parish, the CMSAF is the most important job in the Air

    <p id="P-9633"><span id="SPAN-9634">9.5.3.4.9.1. James C. Binnicker, raised in
    Aiken, South Carolina, joined the Civil Air Patrol in high school with
    aspirations of becoming a pilot. Cadet of the Year honors earned him a
    scholarship to attend flight school and the right to represent his state as a
    foreign exchange cadet in Great Britain. But, in 1957, doctors detected a high
    frequency hearing loss, disqualifying him from the program. To stay close to
    his passion, he joined the Air Force in the personal equipment, later called
    life support, career field. By 1964, Binnicker cross trained into air
    operations, planning flights for missions to Vietnam. While serving in Vietnam
    from 1968 to 1969, he served as NCOIC of operations for the 22d Tactical Air
    Support Squadron, and later as a Vietnamese-speaking linguist at the Republic
    of Vietnam Armed Forces Language School in Saigon. While in Vietnam, he set his
    sights on becoming the CMSAF and, as such, being an advocate for enlisted
    Airmen. He also served as a first sergeant and base Sergeant Major at Seymour
    Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. In 1977, on the recommendation of CMSAF
    Thomas Barnes, he became the sole enlisted member of the newly established
    President's Commission on Military Compensation. In addition, he spent over 7
    years as the senior enlisted advisor for the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 12th
    Air Force, Pacific Air Forces, and Tactical Air Command.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9635"><span id="SPAN-9636">9.5.3.4.9.2. CMSAF Binnicker's first order
    of business was tackling the Airman performance report, a system of ratings
    from 1 to 9. In an effort to more accurately differentiate between Airmen, the
    enlisted performance report was created, along with a system to provide and
    document performance feedback. Next, Binnicker set his sights on admitting
    Master Sergeants to the senior NCO academy. He believed giving Airmen all the
    responsibility they could handle would result in attracting and retaining
    higher quality people in the Air Force. He also worked to give minorities and
    women more responsibilities throughout the Air Force. The Chief of Staff,
    United States Air Force recognized Binnicker as a staunch advocate and
    spokesman for enlisted issues. His commitment to Airmen did not change
    following his retirement in 1994. He stayed abreast of issues affecting the
    enlisted force and visited PME classes to talk with students worldwide. In
    addition, he served as president and chief executive officer for the Air Force
    Enlisted Village until his death in March 2015.</span></p>

    Force as an aircraft mechanic. During his first assignment as a B-52 crew chief
    at Castle Air Force Base, California, he went to work one day with a pack of
    cigarettes and $2, and did not return home for 30 days because the Cuban
    Missile Crisis sent the base into lockdown. Ten years later,&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;worked
    aircraft maintenance in Thailand,&nbsp;reconfiguring&nbsp; B-52s to carry
    conventional bombs in what became known as  iron belly  modifications. In 1973,
    he returned to the states and spent the next 8 1/2 years as a military training
    instructor, and later, chief of the military training division. During an
    assignment to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam,&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;broke his
    back, was hospitalized for 147 days, and returned to duty as the first
    sergeant. Future assignments had&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;taking part in the first

    CMSAF&nbsp;Pfingston s&nbsp;focus during his tenure was the Air Force drawdown
    and budget. Holding the highest enlisted position during Desert Storm, he
    worked to restore basic allowance for subsistence to the troops living in field
    conditions and increasing the Servicemember's Group Life Insurance, but the
    toughest challenge he faced was the Air Force downsizing. To avoid involuntary
    separations,&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;worked to implement the Voluntary Separation
    Incentive and Special Separation Bonus Programs. His idea to provide career
    paths and milestones in line with the officer career model, led to the career
    field education and training plan, three-level and seven-level technical
    schools for all career fields, and mandatory in-residence PME schools. He also
    found himself involved with issues such as homosexuals serving in the military,
    Air Force specialty codes opening up to women, assignment policies including
    the Enlisted Quarterly Assignments Listing (EQUAL) and EQUAL-Plus, and even the
    introduction of the new senior NCO stripes.&nbsp;Pfingston&nbsp;remained active
    in what he called the  communication chain  of former CMSAFs advocating for the

    through, his mother encouraged him to join the Air Force in
    1970.&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;completed aircraft maintenance technical school
    despite poor study habits and breaking his collarbone playing football. He
    credits his supervisors at his first base with turning his attitude
    around.&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;sought challenges, volunteering for several tours
    to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, in support of B-52 Arc Light missions in
    Southeast Asia. He later volunteered to transfer to aerial repair. As he rose
    through the ranks,&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;earned the distinguished graduate award
    at both the NCO academy and senior NCO academy and was stripes for exceptional
    performer-promoted to Master Sergeant. He later served as a senior enlisted
    advisor, a role called  richly rewarding. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-9657"><span id="SPAN-9658">9.5.3.4.11.2. The year
    CMSAF&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;began his tour, the military launched the new TRICARE
    health program. The change introduced many questions and a great deal of
    anxiety. He led the charge to alleviate those feelings through education. Also,
    when Congress threatened to change the retirement system to  High One 
    effectively reducing retirement pay,&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;quickly responded.
    With senior leader support,&nbsp;Campanale&nbsp;stood before Congress in the
    successful fight against the proposed change. Another important recruitment and
    retention milestone was adoption of the one-plus-one dormitory standard, which
    gave each Airman his or her own room. Not a proponent of long speeches, while
    visiting bases he encouraged questions rather than delivering a speech, which created
    meaningful dialogue. He believes anyone can become CMSAF and offers those who
    want to follow in his footsteps this piece of advice: Be honest and keep your

    out of the area, he joined the Air Force as an administrative specialist. Although
    first assigned to Ellington Air Force Base, Texas (less than 25 miles from
    Houston), he would get his chance to travel 9 months later, on orders to
    Ching&nbsp;Chuan&nbsp;Kang Air Base, Taiwan. During his tour, he deployed to
    South Vietnam, where he spent his 20th birthday. As the United States Air
    Forces Europe senior enlisted advisor, he facilitated the highly
    successful&nbsp;beddown&nbsp;of forces during the Bosnia Operation Joint
    Endeavor. He led numerous quality-of-life initiatives, including eliminating/remodeling
    a third of the United States Air Forces Europe zero-privacy dormitories, making
    way for the newly developed one-plus-one dormitories. During his

    basics, and changing the culture of the Air Force to meet new expeditionary
    requirements. He championed Warrior Week at basic training and ensured funding
    for a simulated deployed location at&nbsp;Lackland&nbsp;Air Force Base, Texas.
    He instituted changes in the First Sergeant Academy curriculum, focusing on
    deployment responsibilities. He believed changing the title  senior enlisted
    advisor  to  Command Chief Master Sergeant  and adding the star to the chevron
    were critical to the success of these positions, in garrison and on the
    battlefield. CMSAF&nbsp;Benken&nbsp;engaged Congress and special interest groups
    on numerous fronts, ultimately defeating attempts to alter basic military
    training gender-integrated training, and reversing the diminished retirement
    system of 1986. Other significant challenges included ensuring TRICARE met
    health care needs, and modernizing the force with a limited budget. He believed
    Air Force leaders should focus on the future and take steps to prepare the

    Jim Finch entered the Air Force from East Hampton, New York, expecting to do
    only a 4-year hitch. He planned to learn a trade and see what the world had to
    offer and move on. Finch spent the early part of his career in the  bomb dumps 
    as a missile maintenance crew chief before becoming a PME instructor. After 4
    years of teaching, Finch moved to the Leadership and Management Development
    Center at Maxwell Air Force Base Alabama. While there, he helped develop a
    correspondence version of the NCO preparatory course, and taught new PME
    instructors. He was subsequently selected as the Air Force NCO PME functional
    manager at the Air Force Military Personnel Center. While there, he was
    involved in restructuring the PME program from four to three levels and
    implementing procedures to create Airman Leadership School and allow Master

    college, married his school sweetheart, and worked in textile mills and
    construction before entering the Air Force as an F-4 aircraft crew chief in 1977.
    Murray's performance and capabilities were quickly recognized by his promotion
    to Senior Airman below the zone, and selection as an F-16 aircraft maintenance
    instructor. He continued to excel as the senior F-16 crew chief on "Victor
    Alert" at&nbsp;Incirlik&nbsp;Air Base, Turkey, and later as an A-10
    squadron production superintendent. Deployed in support of Operations Desert
    Shield and Desert Storm, he played a key role as the combat turn director at
    the most forward operation location in theater, garnering the Bronze Star, and
    later the Air Force General Lew Allen Trophy. After standing up a new A-10

    principles and took a leading role in developing a new physical fitness program
    to improve Air Force-wide capabilities and readiness. Additionally, Murray led
    efforts to balance the enlisted force structure by increasing high-year tenure
    for four enlisted grades, bringing back the career job reservation and NCO
    retraining programs, and redistributing senior NCO promotions in critical and

    developing and taking care of Airmen, and modernizing aging air, space, and
    cyberspace assets. CMSAF McKinley focused on properly organizing, training, and
    equipping Airmen during a time when many were being tasked outside their core
    competencies. His efforts to improve the enlisted evaluation system resulted in
    the first major changes to feedback and performance report forms since 1990.
    CMSAF McKinley also advocated for an educated enlisted corps and strongly
    encouraged Airmen to pursue their Community College of the Air Force degree
    earlier in their careers. A strong advocate for the  American Airman  spirit,
    he opened the door for creation of the Airman's Creed, which codified core Air

    <p id="P-10134"><b id="B-10135"><span id="SPAN-10136">9.16. Introduction.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-10137"><span id="SPAN-10138">Military ethics is about
    each Airman doing what is right and just for our country, Air Force, and unit.
    Our Air Force, driven towards excellence by competence and character, is built
    upon thousands of good Americans that have volunteered to defend our country.
    These Airman realize truth and integrity are more than buzz words; those words
    are the focal point of our moral compass. As General John D. Ryan, the 16th Air
    Force Chief of Staff, said "any order to compromise integrity is not a
    lawful order." Airmen must have the courage to be the type of people we
    ought to be. Ethical Airmen are not focused on personal successes or virtues.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10139"><span id="SPAN-10140">9.16.1. As an Airman
    serving proudly in the Profession of Arms, you definitely know the difference
    between right and wrong. The Air Force provides guiding rules and standards
    through an ethical code. An ethical code guides us in our daily decision
    making. Our ethical code is prescribed throughout our Air Force Core Values,
    Oath of Enlistment, Oath of Office, Air Force Instructions, and the Uniform
    Code of Military Justice. You ll be faced with decisions. Some decisions you
    will have to make. Other decisions you will help your wingmen make. These
    decisions might be related to your mission, your personal life, or the interest
    of your peers. The choice you make can be successful when you re utilizing
    sound ethical principles.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10141"><span id="SPAN-10142">9.16.1.1. Sound ethical
    principles are rooted in our Air Force Core Values. Our core values of
    Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence&nbsp;In&nbsp;All We Do
    clearly define our identity. Every Airman learns to cherish our core values
    when they enter our profession. They begin by reading the core values, then
    understanding the core values, and finally living the core values. Expanding
    upon our core values lead us to virtues we must practice and demonstrate in our
    lives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10143"><span id="SPAN-10144">9.16.1.2. Integrity
    First is a character trait and the willingness to do what is right even when no
    one is looking.&nbsp; Integrity is your moral compass and inner voice of
    self-control. The virtues of honesty, courage, and accountability stem from
    Integrity First. Honesty means our words must be unquestionable so we preserve
    the trust that unites us through common goal and purpose. Courage is about
    doing the right thing despite fear and empowers us to make ourselves better. Accountability
    instills our responsibility while maintaining transparency and ownership for
    our actions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10145"><span id="SPAN-10146">9.16.1.3. Service Before
    Self tells us professional duties take precedence over personal desires. The
    virtues of duty, loyalty, and respect blossom from Service Before Self. Duty is
    our obligation to perform what is required for the mission; sometimes having to
    make sacrifices in ways that no other profession has or will. Loyalty is our
    internal commitment to the success and preservation of something bigger than
    ourselves, ordered as country, Air Force, and unit. Respect requires us to
    treat each other with dignity and value them as individuals, knowing all Airmen
    possess fundamental worth as human beings.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10147"><span id="SPAN-10148">9.16.1.4.
    Excellence&nbsp;In&nbsp;All We Do directs us to develop a sustained passion for
    the continuous improvement and innovation that propels the Air Force, as well
    as ourselves, beyond the capabilities of our adversaries. The virtues of
    mission, discipline, and teamwork are the cornerstone of Excellence&nbsp;In&nbsp;All
    We Do. Mission encompasses operations, product, and resource excellence; must
    accomplish our duties correctly while practicing fiscal responsibility.
    Discipline is an individual commitment to uphold the highest standards of personal
    and professional conduct, which we demonstrate with attitude, work ethic, and
    continuous improvement. Required is teamwork at every level to complete the
    mission and we must recognize the interdependency of each Airmen's contribution
    toward the mission and strive for organizational excellence.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10149"><span id="SPAN-10150">9.16.1.5. An ethical
    dilemma is a situation where one is forced to choose between at least two
    alternatives. Three general causes of ethical dilemmas are uncertainty,
    competing values, and potential harm. Uncertainty is the result of not having
    all the facts pertaining to the situation, having no experience dealing with
    the situation, or not having a clearly established policy, procedure, or rule
    for deciding how to choose. Competing values occur when our personal values conflict
    with those of our institution, subordinates, peers, or supervisors; however,
    the mark of a true professional is maintaining high professional standards
    despite conflicting values. Potential harm relates to the intentional and
    unintentional consequences caused by your actions; you should always think
    through second and third order consequences of your actions. When facing an
    ethical dilemma, Dr. James H. Toner provides us the framework of ethical
    principles for decision making.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10151"><span id="SPAN-10152">9.16.2. According to Dr.
    James H. Toner, former Professor of International Relations and Military
    Ethics, Air War College, military ethics is rooted in the three&nbsp;Os:&nbsp;<i id="I-10153">owing,</i>&nbsp;<i id="I-10154">ordering</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i id="I-10155">oughting</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10156"><span id="SPAN-10157">9.16.2.1. Military
    ethics cannot properly exist without the concept of owing. If we, as Airmen,
    know who and why we owe, we are able to recognize the obligation,
    responsibility, and duty which give rise to moral thinking and ethical
    reasoning. Airmen must understand they owe a debt of gratitude to our country,
    family, service, chain of command, and comrades. Additionally, from the
    pioneers of aviation to the selfless sacrifice of battlefield Airmen, we owe to
    those who came before us and those we serve with today to strive for
     excellence in all we do .&nbsp; Furthermore, this is a reflection of the core
    value  service before self  as identified in the Airman's Creed:&nbsp;<i id="I-10158">I am
    faithful to a proud heritage, a tradition of honor, and a legacy of valor</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10159"><span id="SPAN-10160">9.16.2.2. The second O
    is for ordering, or what Dr. Toner calls moral structuring and ethical priorities.
    In other words, are you putting your priorities in the right order? Many
    illegal activities or easily prevented mistakes are the result of a leader s
    failure to order<i id="I-10161">&nbsp;</i>wisely and well. As defenders of freedom and
    justice, we take an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, and
    to obey the President and the officers appointed over us, in that order. As
    Airmen, our highest priority is to serve our country. We can never sacrifice
    the good of our nation for the good of our service, our superiors, or
    ourselves. According to Dr. Toner, the proper ordering of our priorities should
    be country, Air Force, and then unit. Dr. Toner explains that to understand
    this concept, look at the service tape on your uniform and notice the United
    States always comes before Air Force. We pronounce the same when we recite our
    Airman's Creed:&nbsp;<i id="I-10162">I am an American Airman, I am a warrior, I have
    answered my nation's call.</i></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10163"><span id="SPAN-10164">9.16.2.3. The final
    O,&nbsp;oughting, is the understanding of what Airmen ought to do every day.
    What Airmen do may not be what they ought to do and this may sound simple, but
    military hierarchies insist upon obedience to orders and total discipline.
    Ethics, however, objects to this, insisting upon conditional and contextual
    obedience to orders, which ought to be obeyed, if lawful. The&nbsp;<i id="I-10165">Manual
    for Courts-Martial</i>, Rule 916, states  It is a defense to any offense that
    the accused was acting pursuant to orders unless the accused knew the orders to
    be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known
    the orders to be unlawful.  Our core values help guide us in the direction of
    what we ought to do.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10166"><span id="SPAN-10167">9.16.3. To support our
    concept of ordering, we are introduced to the three Ps:&nbsp;<i id="I-10168">principle</i>,&nbsp;<i id="I-10169">purpose</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i id="I-10170">people</i>.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10171"><span id="SPAN-10172">9.16.3.1. Our principle, which is truth telling
    and honorable service, is always first. Truth telling goes hand in hand with
    our core value of  integrity first , which is the foundation of trust. Trust
    unites us as Airmen and permits you to grow a strong wingman bond. Honorable
    service is detailed in the Code of Conduct, which in and of itself is an
    ethical guide. Just ask Captain Scott F. O Grady, who was shot down behind
    enemy lines.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10173"><span id="SPAN-10174">9.16.3.2.
    Our purpose as Airmen, clearly defined as mission accomplishment and duty, is
    why our service exists.&nbsp; From hot air balloons to wooden propellers to
    turbofan engines, Airmen have risen to the challenge at hand. We are the
    Tuskegee Airmen that never let an escorted bomber get shot down. We are the
    liberators of the oppressed as evidenced in Operation Desert Storm. We are the
    future of advanced warfare which we proudly proclaim in the Airman's Creed:<i id="I-10175">&nbsp;I
    am an American,&nbsp;My&nbsp;mission is to fly, fight, and win.</i></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10176"><span id="SPAN-10177">9.16.3.3.
    Our people make all of this possible. Just look to the walls of the Enlisted
    Heritage Research Institute to see this is true. Staff Sergeant William
    H.&nbsp;Pitsenbarger&nbsp;gave his life aiding and defending a unit of soldiers
    pinned down by an enemy assault. Sergeant John L.&nbsp;Levitow&nbsp;disregarded
    his own wounds and saved the lives of his entire crew. Senior Airman Jason D.
    Cunningham gave his life so that others may live. Airman First Class Elizabeth
    N. Jacobson made the ultimate sacrifice while guarding a convoy of American
    service men and women. These heroic Airmen personified this passage from the
    Airman's Creed:&nbsp;<i id="I-10178">I am an American Airman, guardian of freedom and
    justice, my nation's sword and shield, its sentry and avenger, I defend my
    country with my life.</i></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10179"><span id="SPAN-10180">9.16.4. To assist our
    decision making, we incorporate the three&nbsp;Rs:&nbsp;<i id="I-10181">rules</i>,<i id="I-10182">&nbsp;results</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i id="I-10183">realities</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10184"><span id="SPAN-10185">9.16.4.1.
    First, obey the rules because the rules are the accepted moral norms. However,
    we can t create rules for every possible situation. When facing an ethical
    dilemma and asking yourself  What ought I do?  reflect on the core values to
    idealize the person we want to be and the example we want to set.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10186"><span id="SPAN-10187">9.16.4.2.
    Additionally, results are the goals of country, Air Force, and unit and our
    responsibility as Airmen is to accomplish the mission. However, in the climate
    of decentralized execution, our responsibility is to figure out how to
    accomplish the mission. Do not make decisions based on self-interests.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10188"><span id="SPAN-10189">9.16.4.3.
    Finally, realities are inputs that effect our decision-making. We must use our
    self-awareness to realize who we are and what we do; because, what we do is who
    we are and who we are is what we do. If your moral compass needs calibration,
    your decision will not direct you on the right path. When your moral compass is
    well maintained, you will guide your country, Air Force, and unit upon a
    righteous path.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10190"><span id="SPAN-10191">9.16.5. To put the
    three&nbsp;Os&nbsp;into action, we utilize the three Ds:&nbsp;<i id="I-10192">discern</i>,&nbsp;<i id="I-10193">declare</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i id="I-10194">do</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10195"><span id="SPAN-10196">9.16.5.1. We must
    discern, or recognize, the correct path to lead our Airmen on. Attentive
    wingmen utilize critical thinking to discern. Remember to properly&nbsp;<i id="I-10197">order</i>&nbsp;your
    thinking.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10198"><span id="SPAN-10199">9.16.5.2. We must
    declare the correct path as we have discerned the correct path. Effective
    leaders educate and promote the growth of their team. Your inclusion of team
    members will enhance the change process.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10200"><span id="SPAN-10201">9.16.5.3.
    Then we must do what we have discerned and declared. Spirited warriors
    accomplish the mission. We speak these truths when reciting the Airman s
    Creed:&nbsp;<i id="I-10202">I am an American Airman, wingman, leader, warrior, I will never
    leave an Airman behind, I will never falter, and I will not fail.</i></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10203"><span id="SPAN-10204">9.16.6.
    As Airmen, we owe those who wore the uniform before us. We are free today
    because others sacrificed their time, effort, and lives to make our country
    what our country is, and we must continue the fight to ensure our country stays
    strong and secure. We must also order<i id="I-10205">&nbsp;</i>our priorities so we are able
    to overcome any temptation to stray from our military norms and values.
    Finally, we should always do what we ought<i id="I-10206">&nbsp;</i>to do.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10207"><span id="SPAN-10208">9.16.6.1.
    When contemplating what to do, considering your possible courses of action is
    important. By listing your possible decisions that could correct the situation,
    you can quality check your ideas to take the most moral path. Put each of your
    courses of action to the test. Dr. Robert M. Hicks, former Deputy Director of
    the Civil Air Patrol, Chaplain Services, identified three tests we can use to
    check the morality of our actions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10209"><span id="SPAN-10210">9.16.6.2.
    The network test consists of asking yourself,  How would this decision look
    when aired on the news?  If your actions were broadcast on the evening news,
    would you be proud of your actions or ashamed of your actions?&nbsp; Would your
    actions discredit yourself or those we owe? If you find the answer to be the
    latter, then your decision doesn t pass the network test.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10211"><span id="SPAN-10212">9.16.6.3.
    The United States of America test focuses on asking yourself,  Is this decision
    good for America? Is this decision good for the United States Air Force? Is
    this decision good for my unit? Is this decision good for me?  If you take this
    course of action, are you properly ordering your priorities? Would your actions
    promote the virtues of Service Before Self (duty, loyalty, and respect)? If you
    can t answer this with a resounding yes, this might not be the best decision.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10213"><span id="SPAN-10214">9.16.6.4.
    The divine test deals with asking yourself,  Would I feel good about the
    decision when I give account for my life?  When telling the story of your proud
    and honorable service to our country, would you include conversation about this
    decision? Would you feel guilt or loss of trust from this action? If you can t
    answer this with a positive input, the course of action fails the divine test.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10215"><span id="SPAN-10216">9.16.6.5.
    Utilizing the information provided to you should provide you with a clear path
    of understanding on how to make ethical decisions. What is important to keep
    your focus on are two main areas of honorable service: your commitment to the
    Profession of Arms and your ability to make ethical choices. You can build your
    own ethical knowledge while fostering that of your peers. Remind yourself and
    your peers of the reason you do what you do, as found in the Oath of Enlistment
    or Oath of Office. Declare the importance of adhering to established ethical
    codes, relying on them when faced with a choice between right and wrong. Use
    Dr. Toner's model and Dr. Hicks' three tests when making ethical choices.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10217"><span id="SPAN-10218">9.16.7. Military ethics
    is not about others, but is about&nbsp;<i id="I-10219">you</i>&nbsp;knowing what is true and

    <p id="P-10228"><span id="SPAN-10229">Enlisted
    Force Development is a life-cycle approach to developing innovative Airmen
    prepared to accomplish the Air Force mission and lead in a rapidly evolving
    global environment while attempting to meet both personal and professional
    needs. Deliberate development is essential throughout an Airman's career and
    satisfied through education on institutional competencies, training on
    functional competencies, a varied array of experiential opportunities, and
    force developmental tools. When developing Airmen, what is essential is to
    ensure they take full advantage of the abundant opportunities and resources
    that exist both functionally and institutionally. What is imperative from an
    enterprise perspective, is to look at how Airmen progress through their career
    fields and then into operational and strategic leadership positions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10230"><span id="SPAN-10231">9.17.1.
    Functionally, the Air Force develops technical experts through career field
    progression and succession planning. From the earliest stages of their careers,
    Airmen and their supervisors must comprehend the progression path for technical
    and professional development. In the majority of career fields, the progression
    roadmap and developmental pyramid provide sufficient direction to produce
    Airmen qualified for their current duties and for future responsibilities.
    Incumbent upon Career Field Managers is to routinely review their progression
    strategy to ensure their career field's technical requirements are being
    satisfied.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10232"><span id="SPAN-10233">9.17.2.
    Institutionally, we strive to develop experienced leaders. As Airmen
    demonstrate expertise and potential, they should be encouraged to take on more
    responsibility and increased leadership roles. Developmental opportunities such
    as deployments, joint assignments and headquarters staff assignments offer a
    unique perspective on how the Air Force functions. Furthermore, special duty
    assignments provide skills and insight beneficial to an Airman's future
    capabilities.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10234"><span id="SPAN-10235">9.17.3.
    Additionally, educational opportunities exist throughout an Airman's career
    which contribute to individual overall development. Enlisted Professional
    Military Education, developmental education, civilian education and
    other&nbsp;selfimprovement&nbsp;programs such as the United States Air Force
    Library Digital Media Program and Air Force Credentialing Opportunities On-Line
    enhance the knowledge and capabilities of Airmen.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-10236"><span id="SPAN-10237">9.17.4.
    Effective career progression and Airman Development are dependent upon frank
    conversations between supervisors and subordinates regarding career field and
    institutional requirements, personal qualifications and goals, and available
    developmental opportunities. Routine counseling and performance feedback
    sessions should include these discussions.</span></p>

    noncommissioned officers and grow the next generation of senior enlisted
    leaders to meet the highly technical and very complex leadership challenges the
    Department of Defense and the United States Air Force face in the future."</span><span id="SPAN-10251">&nbsp;</span><span id="SPAN-10252">In 2011, pilot Enlisted Development Teams were established in

    Development Teams for all Air Force specialty codes, with execution across the
    enlisted force expected to be complete by 2017. Enlisted Development Teams are
    designed to leverage the development of qualified Airmen with the leadership
    capacity and acculturation necessary to support current and projected mission
    requirements. Career Field Managers use Enlisted Development Teams to perform
    progression and succession planning to place Airmen in key leadership and
    developmental positions based on defined education, training, experience and
    performance requirements. Placing  the right people in the right place at the
    right time  is imperative.</span></p>

    competencies (Figure 9.8) represent those applicable at all levels of the Air

    organizational competencies to establish structure and articulate strategic
    vision. Effective organizational competency skills include technical competence
    on force structure and integration; on unified, joint, multinational, and
    interagency operations; on resource allocation; and on management of complex
    systems. In addition, they apply to conceptual competence in creating policy
    and vision and interpersonal skills emphasizing consensus building and
    influencing peers and other policy makers, both internal and external to the
    organization. This level is the nexus of warfighting leadership skills for the
    Air Force. Also, this level is achieved through having learned the lessons from
    the other types of institutional competencies (i.e., personal and people/team).

    <p id="P-11008"><span id="SPAN-11009">9.23.1.
    Throughout our history, the Air Force has always had a perspective or mindset
    different than the surface components of national military power, and this is
    based on a long history of lessons learned in peace and war. Specifically,
    airpower in application is fundamentally different from other forms of military
    power. Second, inherent flexibility allows the force to be applied
    independently or in concert with other forms of military power. Third, can be
    most effective if applied for the right reasons and in the right concentrations
    at the right time and place to achieve effects on the battlefield. Therefore,
    since Air Force forces are employed differently, in different mediums, at
    different speeds and closure rates and over greater distances. These forces
    must be applied by those who truly appreciate the breadth and scope in the
    application of that power. Finally, Airman should have fluent knowledge of
    these aspects of Air Force capabilities.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11010"><span id="SPAN-11011">9.23.2.
    Airmen are essential to the Air Force institution and the successful execution
    of their mission. To understand and actively advocate the Airman's perspective
    on the use of airpower to achieve objectives as directed by proper authority is
    important. All Airmen share the same goal to accomplish their organization s
    mission. In order to defend the United States and global interests, Airmen
    should be prepared to fly and fight in air, space, and cyberspace. Using the
    Airman's perspective gives Airmen a distinctive advantage when performing this
    mission of the Air Force. Airmen bring not only knowledge, skills, and
    abilities that allow them to accomplish this mission, but a manner of
    approaching mission accomplishment unique to those educated, trained, and
    experienced in bringing&nbsp;airmindedness&nbsp;to all actions they perform. An
    Airman brings a perspective to performing the Service's mission that compounds
    his or her effectiveness in a manner best suited to support a commander.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11012"><span id="SPAN-11013">9.23.3.
    Upon entering the Air Force, members take an oath signifying their personal
    commitment to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and a
    commitment and willingness to serve their country for the duration of their Air
    Force career. The oath is a solemn promise to do one's duty and meet one's responsibilities.
    The oath espouses the responsibility to lead others in the exercise of one s
    duty.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11014"><span id="SPAN-11015">9.23.4.
    Building warrior leaders who have the competencies and skills to understand the
    complexity of expeditionary operations and the successful execution of airpower
    capabilities in unilateral, joint, or coalition operations is a responsibility
    shared by the Air Force and individual Airmen. Also, Airmen must be able to use
    scarce resources effectively to deliver required air, space, and cyberspace
    effects. The development of this warrior ethos is an individual and
    organizational responsibility.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11016"><span id="SPAN-11017">9.23.5.
    When Air Force forces are employed in various operational environments, they
    offer basic characteristics that, when exploited, are fundamental to the
    successful conduct of war and peace. These characteristics, when molded into
    viable force capabilities and executed by knowledge-enabled Airmen, enhance the
    overall ability of the joint team to achieve success when called upon.
    Therefore, each Airman should understand and be able to articulate the full
    potential and application of Air Force capabilities required to support the Air
    Force mission and meet United States national security objectives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11018"><b id="B-11019"><span id="SPAN-11020">9.24. The Warrior Ethos:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-11021"><span id="SPAN-11022">9.24.1.
    The central focus of the profession of arms is warfighting. As Airmen, we have
    a special responsibility to ensure the most lethal Air Force the world has ever
    seen flies and fights the right way. Airmen have inherited an Air Force forged
    through the ingenuity, courage, and strength of Airmen who preceded them. An
    Airman's duty is to continue to provide the Nation and the next generation of
    Airmen an equally dominant Air Force. Doing so requires Airmen to fully
    understand the profession of arms they have chosen, the commitment they made by
    taking an oath of office, and the acceptance to live according to the Air
    Force's core values. This is the warrior ethos and a mindset designed to build
    the confidence and commitment necessary to shape professional Airmen able to
    work as a team to accomplish the mission. This mindset is shaped by an
    expeditionary service during combat, humanitarian response, disaster relief
    operations, and by the lessons learned from those operations. The warrior ethos
    is also developed and sustained over the course of a career through a continuum
    of learning and associated development experiences, including a wide variety of
    assignments, focused training and education, exhibiting pride in the Air Force
    uniform, physical conditioning, and understanding Air Force symbols, history, and
    culture.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11023"><span id="SPAN-11024">9.24.2. Airmen share a
    history of service, honor, and sacrifice. From the earliest days of airpower to
    the heights of space,</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11025"><span id="SPAN-11026">Airmen
    have built an extraordinary heritage that forms the foundation for the
    Service's boundless horizon. Even though we are technology focused, we value
    quality over quantity. We embrace change and through transformation and
    innovation ensure a viable Air Force for the future. Airmen firmly grounded in
    the core values and ingrained with the warrior ethos react to combat stresses,
    operational deployment pressures, and daily home station demands with valor,
    courage, and sacrifice. We all have these characteristics, which surface often
    during times of great difficulty or unforeseen circumstances. While many acts
    of valor, courage or sacrifice go unseen, others helped shape the finest
    traditions of the Air Force. They should be recognized not only as part of
    United States Air Force history, but also to illustrate that any Airman may be
    called upon to perform above and beyond in the profession of arms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11027"><b id="B-11028"><span id="SPAN-11029">9.25. Valor.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-11030"><span id="SPAN-11031">Valor
    is the ability to face danger or hardship in a determined and resolute manner
    and is commonly known as bravery, fearlessness, fortitude, gallantry, heart,
    nerve, and many other terms. Valor is the willingness to step outside of one s
    comfort zone to deal with an unexpected situation. Such situations can happen
    almost anywhere. Valor exists in places other than on the battlefield; an
    Airman can exhibit valor when presented with unusual circumstances in the daily
    routine of life. When acting with valor, one expresses the qualities of a hero
    or heroine.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11032"><i id="I-11033"><span id="SPAN-11034">In the summer of 2005, Senior Airman&nbsp;Shea&nbsp;Dodson wanted
    to do more than his assigned administrative duties inside of Baghdad's Green
    Zone. The call was out for volunteers to provide security for ongoing convoys,
    so Airman Dodson raised his hand. After some intense just-in-time training, he
    was performing security detail for his first convoy. On this mission, Airman
    Dodson put that training to good use. When a suspected vehicle-borne suicide
    bomber raced toward the convoy, he fired .50 caliber rounds into the engine
    block no fewer than four times, disabling the vehicle. During the same mission,
    his unit became mired in traffic near a high-rise development. He noticed
    movement above and saw an Iraqi armed with an AK-47 creeping toward the edge of
    a balcony overlooking the convoy. Airman Dodson immediately engaged with
    indirect warning fire from his M-16, hitting the wall next to the suspected
    insurgent's head. The armed Iraqi dove for cover and never returned. When the
    convoy arrived at its final destination, a children's school, he continued with
    a complete security sweep of the perimeter houses to ensure it was clear.
    Airman Dodson remained on armed watch as his team handed out school supplies to
    the kids in the open courtyard. By 2 PM that same day, Airman Dodson was back
    at his desk, keeping track of critical data for the commanding general of the
    Multinational Security Transition Command Iraq. It was all in a day's work for
    this dedicated Airman.</span></i></p>

    in the profession of arms:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11065"><span id="SPAN-11066">personal,
    physical, and moral. Personal courage is about doing what's right even at risk
    to one's career. Physical courage is the ability to overcome fears of bodily
    harm to get the job done, or willingness to risk yourself for someone else s
    sake in battle or the course of everyday life. Finally, moral courage is the
    ability to stand by the core values when moral courage may not be the popular
    thing to do. Integrity breeds courage when and where the behavior is most
    needed. More often than not, courage is manifested as an act of bravery on the
    battlefield as Airmen face the challenges present in combat.</span></p>

    Sergeant Corey&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;was loading cargo on his aircraft when he saw
    a Romanian C-130 experience a hard landing. Unbeknownst to the Romanian crew,
    the aircraft brakes caused a fire, causing Sergeant&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;to spring
    into action. He instructed a fellow loadmaster to inform his aircraft commander
    of the situation and to ensure that someone contacted the control tower of the
    fire while he and a crew chief grabbed fire extinguishers and ran toward the
    burning aircraft. The Romanian C-130 fire intensified as it spread to the
    aircraft's fuselage and ruptured the hydraulic brake line. Despite the danger
    to himself, Sergeant&nbsp;Clewleygot within a few feet of the flames and
    attempted to suppress the fire. His sense of urgency tripled when he realized
    the C130 crew was still inside the aircraft and was unable to get out of the
    burning aircraft. He saw a member of the crew mouthing  please, please  and
    pointing to the troop exit door. Sergeant&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;refocused his attention
    to that area and began suppressing the fire, enabling the crew to safely exit
    the aircraft. He continued to keep the fire under control until the fire
    department arrived. Sergeant&nbsp;Clewley&nbsp;credits the team effort that
    kept the incident from becoming a deadly event and never considered the risk to
    his own life as he worked to save a crew and aircraft that was not part of his
    responsibility, his service, or even his Nation. He noted that saving the lives
    of the people on board was more important than who owned the aircraft.</span></i></p>

    following situations: while engaged in action against a United States enemy,
    while engaged in military operations involving conflict with a foreign force,
    or while serving with a Friendly nation engaged in armed conflict against a
    force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The Air Force
    Cross is awarded when the heroic actions fall just short of warranting the
    Congressional Medal of Honor. Only 24 Airmen have been awarded the Air Force

      awards the Air Force Cross to Senior Airman Jason D. Cunningham for
      extraordinary heroism in military operations against an opposing armed force
      while serving as a&nbsp;pararescueman&nbsp;near the village
      of&nbsp;Marzak&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Paktia&nbsp;Province of Afghanistan on 4
      March 2002. On that proud day, Airman Cunningham was the primary Air Force
      Combat Search and Rescue medic assigned to a Quick Reaction Force tasked to
      recover two American servicemen evading capture in austere terrain occupied
      by massed Al Qaida and Taliban forces. Shortly before landing, his MH-47E
      helicopter received accurate rocket-propelled grenade and small arms fire,
      severely disabling the aircraft and causing it to crash land. The assault
      force formed a hasty defense and immediately suffered three fatalities and
      five critical casualties. Despite effective enemy fire, and at great risk to
      his own life, Airman Cunningham remained in the burning fuselage of the
      aircraft in order to treat the wounded. As he moved his patients to a more
      secure location, mortar rounds began to impact within fifty feet of his
      position. Disregarding this extreme danger, he continued the movement and
      exposed himself to enemy fire on seven separate occasions. When the second
      casualty collection point was also compromised, in a display of uncommon
      valor and gallantry, Airman Cunningham braved an intense small arms and
      rocket-propelled grenade attack while repositioning the critically wounded to
      a third collection point. Even after he was mortally wounded and quickly
      deteriorating, he continued to direct patient movement and transferred care
      to another medic. In the end, his distinct efforts led to the successful delivery
      of ten gravely wounded Americans to life-saving medical treatment. Through
      his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, aggressiveness in the face of
      the enemy, and in the dedication of his service to his country, Senior Airman
      Cunningham reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States
      Air Force.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11145"><span id="SPAN-11146">9.29.1. One of the
    telltale signs of a military professional is preparation. When the time comes
    to use their skills, military professionals are ready because they took
    advantage of opportunities to gain experience. Every military member will have
    opportunities to serve. Those opportunities may be mundane, exciting, or
    inconvenient, but each will provide a chance to gain experience and improve
    readiness levels.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11147"><span id="SPAN-11148">9.29.2.
    Often, opportunities to serve do not look particularly exciting or rewarding,
    but they hold the seeds of greatness. Doing such tasks builds the experience
    level needed to sharpen judgment and discernment. Military members should be
    open to a variety of experiences in order to grow in all areas of life
    (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual). Military professionals cannot be
    disconnected from the world and must remember that the cost of choosing one
    path may be the opportunity to take another.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11149"><span id="SPAN-11150">9.29.3.
    The military professional who stands ready to make critical decisions and is
    able to perform under pressure is usually the one who took advantage of unique
    opportunities that arose. From past experiences, professionals build the
    confidence, judgment, courage, and integrity they need to act professionally.
    Will they always feel ready? Probably not, but most will likely say they wish
    they had more experience upon which to base their decisions or improve their
    performance. Most experience is gained by accepting opportunities as they come,
    even when conditions are not perfect.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11151"><span id="SPAN-11152">9.29.4.
    Certainly, no one can do everything. Members must select wisely to prevent
    overloading and burnout. They can round out their perspective vicariously by
    sharing others' experiences through reading. Charles, Archduke of Austria,
    pointed to this thought when he said,  A great captain can be formed only by
    long experience and intense study; neither is his own experience enough for
    whose life is sufficiently fruitful of events to render his knowledge
    universal? </span></p>

    In 1996, General&nbsp;Fogleman&nbsp;created the Chief of Staff, United States
    Air Force Professional Reading Program to develop a common frame of reference
    among Air Force members officers, enlisted, and civilians to help each become
    better, more effective advocates of air and space power. Each Chief of Staff,
    United States Air Force since then has enhanced and continued the Chief of
    Staff, United States Air Force's Professional Reading Program. In 2012, General
    Norton A. Schwartz revised the list by adding books; films; technology,
    entertainment, design briefings; and online resources.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11158"><span id="SPAN-11159">9.30.2.
    This program can help launch a career-long reading habit or be used to
    supplement previous readings. Listed materials cover various topics, although
    the majority detail air and space power from its genesis to recent times. These
    sources provide great examples of leadership to illustrate qualities Airmen
    should emulate. The list includes insight into Air Force history, analyze
    ongoing conflicts and their relevancy to the future, furnish organizational and
    leadership success stories, and provide lessons learned from recent conflicts.
    The more you study, the better you will understand the background behind the

    <p id="P-11171"><span id="SPAN-11172">9.31.1.
    Core values are at the heart and soul of the military profession:&nbsp;<i id="I-11173">integrity
    first, service before self, and excellence in all we do.&nbsp;</i>Such values
    are closely intertwined since integrity provides the bedrock for our military
    endeavors, and is fortified by service to country. This in turn fuels the drive
    for excellence. In light of the demands placed upon our people to support
    United States security interests around the globe, the concept of  service
    before self  needs further discussion. As members of the joint team, Airmen are
    part of a unique profession founded on the premise of service before self.
    Airmen are not engaged in just another job: they are practitioners of the
    profession of arms. They are entrusted with the security of the Nation, the
    protection of their citizens, and the preservation of their way of life. In
    this capacity, they serve as guardians of America's future, and this
    responsibility requires Airmen to place the needs of service and country before
    personal concerns.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11174"><span id="SPAN-11175">9.31.2.
    The military profession is sharply distinguished from others by what General
    Sir John Hackett has termed the  unlimited liability clause.  Upon entering the
    Air Force, Airmen accept a sacred trust from the American people. They swear to
    support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,
    foreign and domestic. They take this obligation freely without any reservations
    and thereby commit their lives in defense of America and their citizens.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11176"><span id="SPAN-11177">9.31.3. No other
    profession expects their members to lay down their lives for their friends,
    families, or freedoms. By voluntarily serving in the military profession,
    Airmen accept unique responsibilities. In today's world, service to country
    requires not only a high degree of skill, but also a willingness to make
    personal sacrifices. Airmen work long hours to provide the most combat
    capability possible for the taxpayer dollar. Military professional's duties
    require them to go temporary duty or permanent change of station to harsh
    locations to meet national security needs; are on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a
    week; and when called, deploy to the far corners of the globe without
    complaint.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11178"><span id="SPAN-11179">9.31.4.
    Inherent in all of this is individual willingness to subordinate personal
    interests for the good of the unit, Service, and Nation. Airmen can ill afford
     sunshine soldiers,  or those who focus on careerism. Instead, the military
    needs professionals who strive to be the best at their current job, and who
    realize they attain individual advancement through the success of their unit or
    work center. Careerism can be most damaging in the case of leaders. If
    subordinates perceive leaders are consumed with career concerns, they will be
    unwilling to forgo personal goals for the good of the unit and the Air Force.
    This situation is only aggravated by attempts to serve  through a position  or
    to do a quick  touch and go  in a key job simply to fill out a resume.
    Ultimately, the mission will suffer with potentially devastating consequences.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11180"><span id="SPAN-11181">9.31.5.
    So, what is the payoff for placing service before self? The paycheck or the
    benefits is not what keeps the professionals going. Professionals remain with
    the Air Force because of the intangibles: the satisfaction gained from doing
    something significant with their lives, the pride in being part of a unique
    organization that lives by high standards, and the sense of accomplishment
    gained from defending the Nation and their democratic way of life.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11185"><span id="SPAN-11186">9.32.1.
    This chapter discusses the philosophy, purpose, and structure of the enlisted
    force and examines the NCO in terms of rank and precedence, legal authority,
    and general and specific responsibilities.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;briefly described is
    the special positions of trust senior NCOs may hold, such as Air Force career
    filed manager, first sergeant, Command Chief Master Sergeant, and Chief Master
    Sergeant of the Air Force, and concludes with a discussion of the profession of
    arms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11187"><span id="SPAN-11188">9.32.2.
    The word  professional  should inspire all enlisted members to aspire to the
    ideal of service and expertise. Professional status comes to people at
    different times in their lives and careers. Furthermore, professionalism is
    achieved through continuous study, practice, and experience. Overall, the
    military seems to fit strongly into the professional category, but at what
    point can an individual claim professional military status? Professional status
    is expressed by attitudes and commitments, and by internalizing military
    values. Studying and understanding these factors are vital to the senior NCO
    and the future of the United States Air Force. Every senior NCO has an
    obligation to the United States, to the Air Force, and to his or her supervisor
    and subordinates to be the very best professional possible.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11189"><span id="SPAN-11190">9.32.3.
    Future military members must educate themselves through study, experience, and
    by observing others. They must learn to accept responsibility for their actions
    and those of their subordinates, and to take appropriate action, never hiding
    behind excuses. Their focus must be on devoted service to the Nation, not on
    pay, working conditions, or their next assignment. Only then will they move
    toward achieving the ideal of professionalism.</span></p>

    could that be true? Is leadership a characteristic shared only by those gifted
    enough to lead or is it simply defined by a person's position and authority?
    After all, given the authority anyone can command, but what sort of influence
    does one who merely commands and directs have on those who follow? In all
    actuality, leadership is an ability we all can develop and a leader s
    effectiveness is often determined by the actions of those who choose to follow.
    Leadership is a delicate mix of art and science requiring people-oriented
    attributes, interpersonal communication, and an undeniable character that
    motivates, or wills, others to follow. This chapter examines the art and
    science of leadership and includes information to assist Airmen in
    understanding what leadership is, how it pertains to the Air Force mission, and
    why it is important to the institution of airpower. This chapter continues with
    a brief explanation of the differences, and interrelationships between
    leadership and management, offers an opportunity to assess one's leadership
    qualities, and advice on how to become a more effective leader. Furthermore, it
    explains the concept of vision, empowerment, and provides information
    pertaining to leadership flexibility and followership. Lastly, we will explore
    ways to effectively manage change and mentor followers.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11216"><span id="SPAN-11217">Merriam-Webster s
    dictionary defines the word&nbsp;<i id="I-11218">lead</i>&nbsp;as  to guide on a way
    especially by going in advance  or  to direct on a course or in a direction.  A
    leader is considered a person  who directs a military force or unit  and/or
     who has commanding authority or influence.  With this in mind, we can explain
    the act of leading in the Air Force as  the art and science of accomplishing
    the Air Force mission by motivating, influencing, and directing Airmen.  This
    highlights two central elements: (1) the mission; objective, or task to be
    accomplished; and (2) the Airmen who will accomplish it. All aspects of
    leadership should support the Air Force mission and its Airmen. Successful
    leaders recognize that people are the most valuable resource and, without them;
    the organization fails. Therefore, the Air Force relies on its members to
    develop as leaders for today, and tomorrow. The extent of a person s
    development is dependent on his or her status within the organization (whether
    as an officer, enlisted, or civilian), and the level of responsibility he or
    she has. Most enlisted members function at the tactical level where their
    technical skills are combined with their direct influence on subordinate
    members in daily operations and at war.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11219"><i id="I-11220"><span id="SPAN-11221"> Good leaders are people who have a passion to succeed .To become
    successful leaders, we must first learn that no matter how good the technology

    you are to be a good leader, you have to cultivate your skills in the arena of
    personal relations. </span></i></p>

    <p id="P-11227"><span id="SPAN-11228">Effective
    leadership takes more than simply  talking the talk.  Leadership is modeling,
    or setting the example for others in word and action. For many, this is
    considered the toughest part of leading. However, in order to be successful,
    leaders must evaluate themselves and work on their shortcomings. Effective
    leaders&nbsp;<i id="I-11229">lead</i>&nbsp;rather than drive people. They make fair and firm
    decisions that are in the best interest of good order, discipline, and
    successful accomplishment of the mission. A leader's responsibilities go
    further than just being responsible for accomplishing the mission. Effective
    leaders are not only expected to accomplish the mission, but to do so with a
    minimal cost in resources, such as people, materiel, and money. While no one
    expects the leader to be perfect, a leader cannot demand the best from others
    if he or she cannot perform as expected.</span></p>

    service members are obligated to  obey the orders of the President of the U.S.
    and the orders of the officers appointed over [them],  they respond more
    positively and with extra effort to those who genuinely care about them. In
    today's environment of technology and specialization, most leaders tend to find

    are no secrets or  magic formulas' to successful leadership. Rather, leadership
    is an individual and personal choice and everyone develops their own unique
    leadership style. Although the best advice is to just be yourself, all
    ambitious leaders can always benefit from the wise words of others. In 1976,
    while he was Commander in Chief, Pacific Air Forces, General Louis L. Wilson,
    Jr., wrote the following timeless advice:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11318"><span id="SPAN-11319">10.4.1.<b id="B-11320">&nbsp;Be Tough.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11321"><span id="SPAN-11322">Set
    your standards high and insist that your people measure up. Have the courage to
    correct those who fail to do so. In the long run, your people will be happier.
    Almost certainly morale will be higher, your outfit better, and your people
    prouder.</span></p>

    going on in your work center. Your Airmen will see that you are interested in
    their problems, work conditions, and welfare. Many of your people problems will

    <p id="P-11331"><span id="SPAN-11332">If you think there are
    no problems in your organization, you may be ignorant to problems that are not
    obvious. The trick is to find them. Foster an environment that encourages
    people to bring problems to you.</span></p>

    to your people. Communicate with them and be perceptive to their needs. Learn
    to recognize problems and seek out ideas. Be innovative. Recognize that

    not put off those hard decisions because you are not willing to make them
    today; as they will not be any easier tomorrow. This does not mean you should
    make precipitous or unreasonable decisions just to be prompt. However, once you
    have arrived at what you believe is correct, get on with it. Do not block

    <p id="P-11365"><span id="SPAN-11366">Once
    people demonstrate laziness, disinterest, or an inability to get the job done,
    you must have the courage to terminate their assignments. You cannot afford to
    do less. On the other hand, when your people are doing good work, recognize the
    good work and encourage them. Certainly they will do even better.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11367"><span id="SPAN-11368">10.4.10.&nbsp;<b id="B-11369">Be Honest.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11370"><span id="SPAN-11371">When talking to your people be candid and insist that they do
    likewise. They set their behavior patterns based upon your example. Nothing is
    more disastrous than garbled information, half-truths, and falsifications. Make
    sure your people know where you stand on this matter. Encourage them to come to
    you if they have questions about what is going on in the unit. You must create
    an atmosphere of trust and confidence. Finally, be honest with yourself do not
    gimmick reports and figures to make things look good on paper. Advice from a
    successful leader can be a beneficial tool to the aspiring leader, but where
    the aspiring leader applies this tool will determine his or her success.</span></p>

    Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision
    Engagement, Information Superiority, and Agile Combat Support. The three Air

    mission, the dangers associated with military service, and the national and
    international influence and potential implications relevant to global
    operations; the Air Force enforces more restrictive rules and elevated
    standards than those found in the civilian community. Individuals unable to
    maintain these higher standards, or are deemed not compatible with military

    <p id="P-11427"><span id="SPAN-11428">Leadership
    and management are simply not the same thing. Successful organizations include
    and depend on elements of control, trust, administration, development, standardization,
    innovation, compliance, and inspiration. Leadership and management go hand in
    hand in producing these elements which promote mission success. Throughout
    military history, there have been accounts of leadership and management in
    action. For instance, during the D-Day Invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944,
    some believe this invasion was an effective use of management which moved the
    U.S. and coalition forces onto the beaches, and the inspirational leadership is
    what moved them forward. So which is more important?</span></p>

    Managerial behaviors focus on building organizational mechanisms that mesh

    concentrate on effectively moving the hands of the timepiece to display the

    Managers use the management process to control people by pushing them in the
    right direction. Leaders motivate and inspire people to keep moving in the
    right direction by satisfying human needs. In order to achieve a vision,
    leaders tailor their behavior toward their followers' needs for achievement,
    sense of belonging, recognition, self-esteem, and control over their lives.
    Bennis offers an appropriate summary of this behavioral characteristics
    comparison in Figure 10.1.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11465"><span id="SPAN-11466">10.6.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-11467">Personal

    successful leaders and managers, as researched by Professor Robert White,
    Indiana University. Neither type of behavior is exclusively positive or
    negative. Figure 10.1 suggests that leaders must have a grasp of management and
    leadership skills to be successful. Moreover, the two cannot (and should not)
    be separated. In other words, leadership is an art that includes management.
    The best managers tend to become good leaders because they develop leadership
    abilities and skills through practicing good management techniques. Similarly,
    seldom is there an effective leader who is not also a good manager. Successful
    leaders humanize their management skills with inspiration, empowerment, and
    vision through charisma.</span></p>

    To be successful, an organization needs both leadership and management. For an
    organization, strong leadership with weak management is no better, and
    sometimes worse, than the opposite. The challenge is to achieve a balance of
    strong leadership and capable management. While not the most effective
    approach, a peacetime military can survive with good administration and
    management up and down the hierarchy, coupled with good leadership concentrated
    at the top. On the other hand, a wartime force must have competent leadership
    at all levels, particularly at the tactical level of war. Good management
    brings a degree of order and consistency to key issues like readiness,
    availability, and sustainment. However, no one has yet figured out how to
    manage people into battle. They must be led.</span></p>

    must demonstrate the attitude they hope to see emulated by their followers. In
    doing so, this same attitude will be more easily adopted by their Airmen. Enthusiasm
    is contagious and can deliver energy to all aspects of organizational
    operations. Although encouragement is normally considered an action,
    encouragement is actually attitude related. The inclination to encourage
    Airmen, as well as oneself, is a powerful motivator and satisfies human needs.
    Effective leaders constantly embrace positive goals and display a positive
    attitude.</span></p>

    degree to which trust, loyalty, and integrity are present in the leadership of
    an organization directly relates to the organization's effectiveness.
    Leadership is the capacity to generate and sustain trust, and trust is
    dependent upon reliability. Indicators of reliability, such as punctual
    attendance at all meetings, prompt attention to correspondence, and meeting
    task deadlines translate into the level of trust people have in one another.
    Trust must also be balanced with a willingness to remove people who cannot be
    trusted and to make tough decisions when necessary. While the right decision is
    not always the easiest decision, Airmen respect leaders for doing the right
    thing and reward leadership with their own trustworthiness and loyalty. Like
    trust, the doors of loyalty swing both ways. Leaders cannot demand unwavering
    loyalty of their followers without being willing to return loyalty to them.
    Integrity is a consistent and honest demonstration of personal commitment to
    the organization and its vision. Therefore, leaders should be ever mindful of
    the ramifications of their behavior and strive to epitomize the Air Force core

    leadership needs. German sociologist Max Weber's research noted that charisma
    is often contrary to authority; superiors consequently frown on it.
    Additionally, once it becomes  old hat  to Airmen, charisma's attraction and

    Leadership requires the courage to address substandard performance or
    unacceptable behavior, to welcome new ideas, do what is ethically right when

    Occasionally, leaders must  get their hands dirty  alongside their followers
    which also bolsters credibility. However, credibility is very fragile and takes
    years to earn through persistent, consistent, and patient leadership and can

    <p id="P-11611"><span id="SPAN-11612">10.8.1.1.
    Vision is helping people believe they can accomplish their goals in the
    anticipation of a better future as a result of their own efforts. Inspiration
    is one way to convey vision. To better understand this concept, consider the
    following examples: President Franklin D. Roosevelt's announcement in May 1940
    that the U.S. would produce 50,000 planes a year, and President John F.
    Kennedy's 1961 announcement of the U.S. intention to put a man on the moon
    within the decade. Both goals were breathtaking, perhaps impossible by most
    standards, and yet both were achieved. In each case, the dramatic announcement
    and the infectious inspiration bred helped achieve the goal.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11613"><span id="SPAN-11614">10.8.1.2.
    The ability to form mental images of a possible outcome and to translate these
    images into a reality through leadership and action is a unique feature of the
    human brain. A leader should constantly anticipate the influences, trends, and
    demands that affect the vision over the next month, year, even decade.
    Unfortunately, a common leadership error is to become preoccupied with the present
    at the expense of the future. To be of realistic value, the vision must be
    logical, deductive, and plausible. Vision must be specific enough to provide
    real guidance to people, but unbounded enough to encourage initiative and
    demonstrate relevancy to a variety of conditions. Leaders without vision are
    doomed to perpetuate complacency. They fail to prosper because they continue
    doing things as they have always been done.</span></p>

    senior leadership has the authority and responsibility to change the system as

    more appropriate to the challenges of the new age. To do this, the leaders must
    communicate the vision to the unit, shop, or work center. Leaders are
    responsible for bolstering their Airmen's courage and understanding. However,
    launching a vision cannot be a single effort. Those who work for and with the
    leader are excellent sources of ideas. Leaders can prepare the organization for
    potential changes to come and disarm resistance to change by soliciting
    suggestions and promoting wide participation.&nbsp;<i id="I-11620">"A great leader s

    be applicable without changes. There is no regular schedule for vision
    revision. However, a wise leader does not wait for the alarm to sound before
    considering alternatives. Rather, the vision-forming process should be
    continual. Leaders should encourage personnel of all ranks, levels, and
    occupations to help articulate the vision. The experience will prove invaluable
    as unit members are promoted into more responsible, higher-level positions and
    continue to build an effective path to the future. On the other hand, the
    vision should not be arbitrarily modified. If the vision works and is
    consistent with environmental and technological developments, the vision should
    be affirmed and supported. As technology and our environment continue to

    <p id="P-11642"><span id="SPAN-11643">Empowerment
    is a force that energizes people and provides responsibility, ownership, and
    control over the work they perform. Some individuals interpret empowerment as
    merely the delegation of authority. Delegation is not empowerment; however,
    effective empowerment does require good delegation. Assigning people tasks,
    along with the freedom and authority needed to creatively accomplish the tasks,
    is the essence of empowerment. Consequently, empowerment is often confused with
    participative leadership emphasizing sensitivity to needs, involving people,
    and asking people for help. While empowerment includes these concepts,
    empowerment goes much further and allows workers to become stakeholders in the
    organization's vision. Once they are committed to this vision, organization
    members begin to participate in shaping and fashioning the vision into a shared
    vision. This synergistically developed vision motivates people to focus on the
    future and what the future holds, not simply because they&nbsp;<i id="I-11644">must</i>, but
    because they&nbsp;<i id="I-11645">want</i>&nbsp;to. For this approach to be successful,
    leaders must always be open and receptive to ideas and suggestions that could
    improve or refine the organization's vision.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11646"><span id="SPAN-11647">10.9.2.<b id="B-11648">&nbsp;Essence of Empowerment.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11649"><span id="SPAN-11650">10.9.2.1.
    The essence of empowerment requires both leaders and followers to identify with
    their respective share of the organization's goals. The military is
    traditionally an authoritarian organization. The need for rapid decisionmaking
    and crisis response normally necessitates a traditional hierarchical framework.
    However, complex hierarchical frameworks do not always result in rapid
    decisions. Furthermore, the continual transformation of leaderfollower roles is
    heralding an environment that allows both leaders and followers to more
    effectively realize organizational goals and objectives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11651"><span id="SPAN-11652">10.9.2.2.
    Effective empowerment is not new. Truly great leaders of the past never
    directly told their people how to do their jobs. Rather, they explained what
    needed to be done and established a playing field that allowed their people to
    achieve success on their own. Consequently, the follower's success became a
    success for the leader and the organization as well. While the responsibility
    for task completion may be on the leader's shoulders, the burden of getting the
    job done is shared by all. Therefore, the adage,  It's lonely at the top,  is
    applicable to a leader who does not recognize the strengths of his or her
    people. Airmen can supply the details and express concerns that help overcome
    barriers to achieving visionary goals and mission accomplishment. When leaders
    solicit input, they discover the knowledge, interest, and parameters of
    support.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11653"><span id="SPAN-11654">10.9.3.<b id="B-11655">&nbsp;Guidelines to Empowerment.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11656"><span id="SPAN-11657">Empowerment
    enhances organizational performance by promoting contributions from every
    member of the organization. Trust is the cornerstone of the mutually dependent
    relationship shared by leaders and followers. Therefore, the leader must be
    flexible and patient in introducing empowerment. By delegating decisions to
    those closest to the issues and by allowing Airmen flexibility in how they
    implement the vision, the leader successfully allows others to take ownership
    of the vision and experience pride in achieving the vision. Thus, the leader
    must maintain a firm grip on operational requirements and strategic planning.
    The leader must also realize that not everyone is willing or ready to accept
    the reins of empowerment. To realize their potential in fulfilling the vision,
    empowered followers need sufficient training on the task at hand. Otherwise,
    they are doomed to fail. On the other hand, Airmen who have expert knowledge in
    a particular field should be encouraged to use this knowledge and improve the
    vision where and when possible. Recognition is a key factor in perpetuating
    improvements. Hence, an important facet of empowerment is the appropriate
    recognition of contributions Airmen make to maximize mission success.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11658"><span id="SPAN-11659">10.9.4.<b id="B-11660">&nbsp;Potential Pitfalls.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11661"><span id="SPAN-11662">Empowerment
    is frequently misunderstood and applied inappropriately. Empowerment is often
    associated with a laissez-faire style of leadership (abdicating responsibility
    for tasks to Airmen who are left to their own devices). This fire-and-forget
    approach to empowerment demonstrates a total absence of leadership. Conversely,
    empowerment is a leader-subordinate relationship that requires even more
    refined supervisory skills than traditional autocracy. People continually need
    direction, knowledge, resources, and support. Furthermore, empowerment and
    vision cannot be imposed. To do so would breed compliance rather than
    commitment. From an application standpoint, many leaders seek consensus as a
    means to empower their people. However, while consensus is assumed to be good
    because consensus represents what the group as a whole wants, consensus is
    usually safe and free of innovative ideas. Additionally, consensus can divert
    an organization from their true goal or vision. The adage that  a camel is a
    horse built by consensus' is not so farfetched. Leaders do not seek
    consensus they build it.</span></p>

    values at the supervisory and subordinate levels. Training is not only
    fundamental in focusing the organization's strategic vision, but also helps
    develop the capabilities of the Airmen who make the vision a reality. Both
    formal and informal training do more than augment a unit's level of technical
    expertise. By providing the skills Airmen need to be successful, organizations
    realize increased energy and motivation.</span></p>

    foster professional growth by insisting their Airmen focus attention on the
    aspects of a situation, mission, or project they control. This is not to say
    tasks should be limited in scope or challenge. On the contrary, some adventure
    should be an integral part of every job. In order to motivate Airmen to learn
    and excel, leaders should provide challenging and enlightening experiences.
    Consequently, some supervisors want to tell an Airman what to do to improve.
    While this may impress the follower with the leader's knowledge, telling an
    Airman what to do to improve creates an unnecessary dependence on the leader
    and critically limits the follower's value of the experience.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11677"><span id="SPAN-11678">10.10.2.2.
    The role of the leader in fostering growth is to identify and analyze knowledge
    and improvement opportunities. This will ensure advancements are permanent and
    pervasive, not temporary and specific. Leaders encourage the learning process
    by formally recognizing individual and unit successes, no matter how large or
    small. A more formal and direct way for the leader to encourage the subordinate
    to learn is by setting standards. Standards have the multiple effects of
    providing feedback to the leader on performance, ensuring quality control of

    An important milestone in any Airman's development process is to experience a
    significant challenge early in his or her career. Developing Airmen for
    leadership positions requires much work over long periods of time. Identifying
    people with leadership potential early in their careers and then determining
    the appropriate developmental challenges for them is the first step. Leaders
    must recognize and diagnose the capabilities of each Airman in their unit or
    organization. Those capabilities may include any skills, talents, experiences,
    personality temperaments, etc., the Airman may have that can contribute to
    current and future mission accomplishment. Leaders must also diagnose the
    developmental needs of Airmen, then assist them with personal and professional
    developmental needs that fulfill current or future job/role and
    responsibilities. Professional development needs may include off-duty
    education, Professional Military Education, specific skill training, additional
    training, professional development seminars/courses, and communication skills,
    etc. Personal developmental needs may include relationships, interpersonal
    skills, communication skills, supervisory skills, off-duty education, etc.
    Today's effective leaders had opportunities early in their careers that
    required them to lead, take risks, and learn from their triumphs and failures.
    In business, successful corporations do not wait for leaders to come along.
    Rather, they actively seek out people with leadership potential and expose them
    to career experiences designed to develop their skills. However, leaders must
    caution themselves against becoming preoccupied with finding and
    developing&nbsp;<i id="I-11707">young</i>leadership potential. Leaders must guard against
    overlooking the  late bloomer  whose leadership potential was not evident early
    on. A late bloomer's combination of maturity, experience, and untapped
    potential is a valuable asset to any organization.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11711"><span id="SPAN-11712">10.10.4.1. To learn and
    improve, people need to be encouraged to try new things; sometimes their
    efforts will fail. A fundamental aspect of empowerment is acknowledging the
    right to fail. Obviously, some common sense is required. There can be no
    tolerance for violating regulations, jeopardizing safety, or failing due to a
    lack of effort. However, if the setback is the result of a failed attempt,
    applaud the initiative and dissect the setback so the Airman can learn from
    what went wrong. Unfortunately, the fear of failure prevents many otherwise
    capable individuals from pursuing their creativity and innovation. An Airman s
    dedication to improving his or her abilities is quite a valuable asset to an
    organization. Followers must remain optimistic, even in times of adversity.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11713"><span id="SPAN-11714">10.10.4.2.
    Some people believe the key to success is to avoid failure. Consequently, they
    stay with the things they know and do well rather than risk failure by trying
    something new. The surest way to stifle creativity and innovation is to allow
    fear to perpetuate complacency. Airmen count on the experience and
    understanding of strong leaders in dealing with setbacks. There is no
    substitute for being able to say to an Airman,  I know what you re feeling,
    I ve experienced similar setbacks. Here is how I chose to deal with the
    situation, and these are what the consequences of my actions were. Reflecting
    back on the situation, here is what I would do now if I had the chance to do
    things over. </span></p>

    everything there is to know about the change before dealing with the change can
    even take place. Furthermore, they must learn how to deal with the emotions
    that result from the chaos and fear associated with change. Putting new processes
    in place is not enough. The people supporting these processes must be motivated
    to meet the challenge and support the change. To achieve that, leaders must
    maintain a clear understanding of the present and a clear focus on the future.</span></p>

    The leader must create an organizational climate conducive to change by

    possibilities and benefits of the proposed change. Next, the leader must
    facilitate the change itself: walk Airmen through the change, explain the
    details, and answer questions. Finally, the leader should reward those who
    comply with the change and refocus those who do not. Tough-minded optimism is

    <p id="P-11742"><span id="SPAN-11743">The
    Air Force core values are the bedrock of leadership in the Air Force. The core
    values are a statement of those institutional values and principles of conduct
    that provide the moral framework within which military activities take place.
    The professional Air Force ethic consists of three fundamental and enduring
    values of integrity, service, and excellence. This ethic is the set of values
    that guides the way Air Force members live and perform. Success hinges on the
    incorporation of these values into the character of every Airman. In today s
    time compressed, dynamic, and dangerous operational environment an Airman does
    not have the luxury of examining each issue at leisure. He or she must fully
    internalize these values to be able to automatically act in all situations to
    maintain integrity, to serve others before self, and to perform with excellence
    and encourage others to do the same. The Air Force core values Integrity First,
    Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do represent the commitment each
    Airman makes when joining the Air Force. These values provide a foundation for
    leadership, decision-making, and success, whatever the level of assignment,
    difficulty, or dangers presented by the mission.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11744"><i id="I-11745"><span id="SPAN-11746">All Airmen are men and women of character. Our enduring Air Force

    from ourselves. We have wonderful people in the Air Force. But we aren t
    perfect. Frequent reflection on the core values helps each of us refocus on the

    <p id="P-11759"><span id="SPAN-11760">Integrity
    is the willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking. Integrity
    is the "moral compass," the inner voice, the voice of self-control,
    and the basis for the trust imperative in today's Air Force. Integrity is the
    single most important part of character. Integrity makes Airmen who they are
    and what they stand for, and is as much a part of their professional reputation
    as their ability to fly or fix jets, operate the computer network, repair the
    runway, or defend the airbase. Airmen must be professional, in and out of
    uniform. Integrity is not a suit that can be taken off at night or on the
    weekend or worn only when important to look good. Instead, what makes integrity
    critical is when we least expect to be tested. People are watching us, not to
    see us fail but to see us live up to their expectations; anything less risks
    putting the heritage and reputation of the Air Force in peril. Integrity is the
    ability to hold together and properly regulate all the elements of one s
    personality. A person of integrity acts on conviction, demonstrating impeccable
    self-control without acting rashly. Integrity encompasses many characteristics
    indispensable to Airmen.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11769"><span id="SPAN-11770">10.12<b id="B-11771">.</b>2.1.
    As an Air Force core value, service before self represents an abiding
    dedication to the age-old military virtue of selfless dedication to duty,
    including putting one's life at risk if called to do so. The
    service-before-self value deals with accepting expeditionary deployments and assignments.
    Service before self does not mean service before family. Airmen have a duty to
    their families just as strong as that to the service. The difference is there
    are times when service to the nation requires subordinating the needs of the
    family. Their responsibilities to their families include ensuring they are
    cared for when Airmen are home or deployed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11772"><span id="SPAN-11773">10.12<b id="B-11774">.</b>2.2.
    This value also demands that each Airman keep faith in the system. This does
    not imply that we follow our leaders blindly and not sometimes question what we
    are doing. Airmen must always place trust in the processes, procedures, and
    other Airmen to get the job done in the right way. Airmen must understand that
    an organization can only achieve excellence in an atmosphere free from fear, unlawful
    discrimination, sexual harassment, intimidation, hazing, or unfair treatment.
    Airmen must show loyalty to their leadership, fellow Airmen, and the Air Force
    as a whole, including showing commitment to the Constitution, military chain of
    command, and to both the President and Secretary of Defense.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11783"><span id="SPAN-11784">10.12.3.1.
    This core value demands Airmen constantly strive to perform at their best. They

    mission without jeopardizing morale and loyalty.</span></p>

    constantly work hard to stay in their best physical, mental, emotional,
    spiritual, and moral shape. Airmen continue to enhance their professional
    competencies and are diligent to maintain their job skills, knowledge, and
    personal readiness at the highest possible levels. They understand that when
    members of an organization work together to successfully reach a common goal,
    excellence is achieved and no Airman wins the fight alone. Each organization
    must foster a culture that emphasizes a team mentality while simultaneously
    maintaining standards and accomplishing the mission. Realizing that people are

    <p id="P-11878"><span id="SPAN-11879">Empowered
    followership, like motivation, requires a joint effort between leaders and the
    individuals they lead. This effort must be continuously promoted. Leaders must
    listen and respond to the ideas and needs of their followers, and followers are
    similarly required to listen and respond to the ideas and needs of their
    leaders. Mutual trust is the axis around which this synergistic relationship
    revolves; the benefits reaped are plentiful. Team requirements are best served
    when the leader helps followers develop their own initiatives, encourages them
    to use their own judgment, and allows them to grow and become more effective
    communicators. As a result of promoting empowered followership, follower skills
    such as troubleshooting, problem solving, information gathering, conflict
    resolution, and change management will improve dramatically. Another way to
    promote empowered followership is by getting out among the Airmen and sharing
    their interests. Airmen respond to leaders who show sincere interest in them.
    The success of great leaders depends on their ability to establish a base of
    loyal, capable, and knowledgeable followers.</span></p>

    program designed to help each individual reach his or her maximum potential.
    Professional development is not a new concept and occurs at every echelon and

    AFI 36-703,&nbsp;<i id="I-11895">Civilian Conduct and Responsibility</i>, explains the
    standards regarding professional relationships. In particular, mentoring is
    part of a professional relationship because mentoring fosters communication
    between subordinates and supervisors concerning careers, performance, duties,
    and missions. Finally, mentoring enhances morale and discipline and improves
    the operational environment while maintaining respect for authority.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11896"><span id="SPAN-11897">10.19.2.
    Air Force mentoring covers a wide range of areas, such as career guidance,
    technical and professional development, leadership, Air Force history and
    heritage, air and space power doctrine, strategic vision, and contributions to
    joint warfighting. Therefore, Air Force mentoring includes knowledge of the
    military ethics and an understanding of the Air Force's core values: Integrity
    First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11898"><span id="SPAN-11899">10.19.3.
    Commanders and supervisors must encourage Airmen to read and comprehend air and
    space power literature, such as Air Force doctrine and operational warfighting
    publications and the books in the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Professional
    Reading Program.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11900"><b id="B-11901"><span id="SPAN-11902">10.20. Assignment of Mentors:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-11903"><span id="SPAN-11904">10.20.1. The immediate
    supervisor or rater is the primary mentor (coach, counselor, guide, role model)
    for each of his or her Airmen. This designation in no way restricts the
    subordinate's desire to seek additional counseling and professional development
    advice from other sources or mentors. Supervisors and commanders must make
    themselves available to Airmen who seek career guidance and counsel.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11905"><span id="SPAN-11906">10.20.2.
    Key to the mentoring process is direct involvement by the commander and
    supervisor. Commanders and supervisors must continually challenge their Airmen
    to improve. They must provide clear performance feedback and guidance in
    setting realistic near-, mid-, and long-term professional and personal
    development goals.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11907"><span id="SPAN-11908">10.20.3.
    Several programs exist to help the commander and supervisor focus attention on
    an Airman's professional development. Among these are performance feedback,
    PME, academic education opportunities, assignment policies, recognition
    programs, and the individual's own personal development actions. Additionally,
    many organizations, programs, and associations are dedicated to the advancement
    and education of military professionals. The first sergeant, base education
    center, and Airman and Family Readiness Center can provide lists and contact
    information for organizations that support military development. Leaders should
    also ensure that Airmen are aware of specific tools available to them such as
    MyVector which enables web based mentoring, career planning, and knowledge
    sharing.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-11909"><b id="B-11910"><span id="SPAN-11911">10.21. Mentoring Responsibilities.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-11912"><span id="SPAN-11913">Air
    Force leaders have an inherent responsibility to mentor future leaders.
    Supervisors must take an active role in their Airmen's professional
    development. They must assist their people by providing realistic evaluations
    of both performance and potential. Supervisors must also be positive role
    models. At minimum, mentoring consists of a discussion of performance,
    potential, and professional development plans during the performance feedback
    session. The feedback should include promotion, PME, advanced degree work,
    physical fitness, personal goals and expectations, professional qualities, next
    assignment, and long-range plans, at minimum. Mentors must distinguish between
    individual goals, career aspirations, and realistic expectations. Each
    individual defines a successful career differently. There are numerous paths to
    meet individual career and success goals. Foremost, however, individuals must
    focus on Air Force institutional needs. The Air Force must develop people
    skilled in the employment and support of air and space power and how this meets
    national security needs. While there is nothing wrong with lofty goals, mentors
    must ensure personnel realize what high but achievable goals are.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11917"><span id="SPAN-11918">PME
    and academic education enhance performance in each phase of professional
    development and build on the foundation of leadership abilities shown during
    the earlier stages of an individual's career. The role of PME in professional
    development is to prepare individuals to take on increased responsibilities
    appropriate to their grade and to enhance their contribution to the Air Force.
    Members should focus on enhancing professional competence and becoming superior
    leaders, while expanding their operational employment of air, space, and
    cyberspace power knowledge. Post-secondary degrees (associate, bachelor s,
    master s, or other advanced academic degrees) are important to professional
    development to the extent that they enhance the degree holder's job and
    professional qualifications. A degree directly related to an individual s
    primary specialty area or occupational series is most appropriate because this
    type of degree adds to his or her depth of knowledge. This is why senior
    noncommissioned officers are required to complete the Senior Noncommissioned
    Officer Academy by correspondence or in residence and obtain a Community
    College of the Air Force degree (any specialty) to receive a senior rater
    endorsement on their performance reports. (<b id="B-11919">Note:</b>&nbsp;This requirement
    is the minimum criteria for endorsement consideration and does not guarantee
    automatic endorsement.) A master's or doctorate degree in management or more
    general studies enhances job performance for personnel reaching the highest

    fields, advanced formal education is a prerequisite for certain jobs.&nbsp;<b id="B-11920">&nbsp;</b></span></p>

    individuals in many career fields and technical specialties. Membership in such
    associations may provide additional opportunities for mentoring as well as

    Sergeant)).</span></p>

    to Senior Master Sergeant and Chief Master Sergeant is accomplished using an
    integrated weighted and central selection board system. In addition to the
    weighted score, the central selection board evaluates each individual using the
     whole person concept.  Board scores are determined by considering performance,
    leadership, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence,
    specific achievements, and education. The board score is added to the weighted

    counseling is a shared effort. Leaders assist Airmen in identifying strengths
    and weaknesses and creating plans of action. Leaders then support them

    Airmen must be forthright in their commitment to improve and candid in their
    own assessment and goal setting.</span></p>

    <p id="P-11964"><span id="SPAN-11965">Leaders
    coach Airmen the same way athletic coaches improve their teams: by identifying
    weaknesses, setting goals, developing and implementing plans of action, and
    providing oversight and motivation throughout the process. Effective coaches or
    leaders must thoroughly understand the strengths, weaknesses, and professional
    goals of their Airmen. Air Force leaders conduct counseling to help Airmen
    become better members of the team, maintain or improve performance, and prepare
    for the future. To conduct effective counseling, leaders should develop a
    counseling style using the characteristics listed in Figure 10.2. This approach
    is very similar to the art of leadership coaching. Coaching is a growing field
    in the Air Force. The Air Force Academy can provide more information about
    coaching as they have a new Mosaic Coaching Program. An overview of this

    is to be understanding of and sensitive to another person's feelings, thoughts,

    see a situation from the other person's perspective. Understanding the Airman s
    position can help the Airman develop a plan of action that fits his or her
    personality and needs one that works for the Airman. Not fully comprehending a
    situation from the Airman's point of view gives a leader less credibility and

    questioning is a necessary skill, use this skill with caution. Too many
    questions can aggravate the power differential between a leader and an Airman
    and place the Airman in a passive mode. The Airman may also react to excessive
    questioning as an intrusion of privacy and become defensive. During a
    leadership development review, ask questions to obtain information or to get
    the Airman to think about a particular situation. Generally, questions should
    be open-ended to evoke more than a  yes-or-no  answer. Well-posed questions may
    help to verify understanding, encourage further explanation, or help the Airman
    move through the stages of the counseling session.</span></p>

    instances of superior or substandard duty performance or behavior. Leaders must
    tell Airmen whether or not their performance met the standard and what they did
    right or wrong (e.g. performance feedback counseling). The key to successful
    counseling for specific performance is to conduct the counseling as close to
    the event as possible. Leaders should counsel Airmen for specific examples of
    superior as well as substandard duty performance.</span></p>

    Counseling.</b>&nbsp;Referral counseling helps Airmen work through a personal
    situation and may or may not follow crisis counseling. Referral counseling may
    also act as preventive counseling before the situation becomes a problem.
    Usually, the leader assists the Airman in identifying the problem and refers
    the subordinate to the appropriate resource, such as legal services, a

    <p id="P-12097"><span id="SPAN-12098">During
    performance and professional growth counseling, conduct a review of an Airman s
    duty performance during a certain period and set standards for the next period.
    Rather than dwelling on the past, focus the session on the Airman's strengths,
    areas needing improvement, and potential.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12099"><b id="B-12100"><span id="SPAN-12101">10.34. Approaches to Counseling.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-12102"><span id="SPAN-12103">An effective leader approaches each Airman as an individual.
    Different people and different situations require different counseling
    approaches. Three approaches to counseling include nondirective, directive, and
    combined. These approaches differ in the techniques used, but they all fit the
    definition of counseling and contribute to the overall purpose. The major
    difference between the approaches is the degree to which the Airman
    participates and interacts during a counseling session.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12104"><span id="SPAN-12105">Figure 10.3 summarizes
    the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12106"><span id="SPAN-12107">10.34.1.<b id="B-12108">&nbsp;Nondirective.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12109"><span id="SPAN-12110">The
    nondirective approach is preferred for most counseling sessions. During the
    counseling session, listen rather than make decisions or give advice. Clarify
    what is said. Cause the Airman to bring out important points to better
    understand the situation. When appropriate, summarize the discussion. Avoid
    providing solutions or rendering opinions; instead, maintain a focus on
    individual and organizational goals and objectives. Ensure the Airman's plan of
    action supports those goals and objectives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12111"><span id="SPAN-12112">10.34.2.<b id="B-12113">&nbsp;Directive.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12114"><span id="SPAN-12115">The
    directive approach works best to correct simple problems, make on-the-spot
    corrections, and correct aspects of duty performance. The leader using the
    directive style does most of the talking and tells the Airman what and when of
    doing something. In contrast to the nondirective approach, the leader directs a
    course of action for the Airman. Choose this approach when time is short, when
    you alone know what to do, or if an Airman has limited problemsolving skills.
    Finally, directive is appropriate when an Airman is immature, insecure, or
    needs guidance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12116"><span id="SPAN-12117">10.34.3.<b id="B-12118">&nbsp;Combined.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12119"><span id="SPAN-12120">In
    the combined approach, the leader uses techniques from both the directive and
    nondirective approaches, adjusting them to articulate what is best for the
    Airman. The combined approach emphasizes the Airman's planning and
    decision-making responsibilities. With your assistance, the Airman develops a
    plan of action. Listen, suggest possible courses, and help analyze each
    possible solution to determine the good and bad points. Then help the Airman
    fully understand all aspects of the situation and encourage the Airman to
    decide which solution is best.</span></p>

    counseling process are identify the need for counseling, prepare for
    counseling, conduct the counseling session, and follow up.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12258"><span id="SPAN-12259">10.35.1.<b id="B-12260">&nbsp;Identify the Need for
    Counseling.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12261"><span id="SPAN-12262">Conduct
    developmental counseling whenever the need arises for focused, two-way
    communication aimed at Airman development. Developing Airmen consists of
    observing their performance, comparing performance to the standard, and then
    providing them feedback in the form of counseling.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12263"><span id="SPAN-12264">10.35.2.<b id="B-12265">&nbsp;Prepare for Counseling.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12266"><span id="SPAN-12267">Successful counseling
    requires preparation. To prepare for counseling:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12268"><span id="SPAN-12269">10.35.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-12270">Select
    a Suitable Place.</b>&nbsp;When scheduling counseling, consider an environment
    with minimal interruptions and free from distractions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12271"><span id="SPAN-12272">10.35.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-12273">Schedule
    the Time.</b>&nbsp;When possible, counsel an Airman during the duty day.
    Counseling after duty hours may be rushed or perceived as unfavorable. The
    length of time required for counseling depends on the complexity of the issue.
    Generally, a counseling session should last less than 1 hour. If you need more
    time, schedule a second session.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12274"><span id="SPAN-12275">10.35.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-12276">Notify
    the Airman well in Advance.</b>&nbsp;The Airman should know why, where, and
    when the counseling session will take place. Counseling following a specific
    event should happen as close to the event as possible.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12277"><span id="SPAN-12278">10.35.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-12279">Organize
    the Pertinent Information.</b>&nbsp;Solid preparation is essential to effective
    counseling. Review all pertinent information including the purpose of the
    counseling, facts and observations about the Airman, identification of possible
    problems, main points of discussion, and the development of a plan of action.
    Focus on specific and objective behaviors the Airman must maintain or improve
    upon as well as a plan of action with clear, obtainable goals.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12280"><span id="SPAN-12281">10.35.2.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-12282">Plan
    the Counseling Approach.&nbsp;</b>There are as many approaches to counseling as
    there are leaders. The directive, nondirective, and combined approaches to
    counseling were addressed earlier. Use a strategy that suits the Airman and the
    situation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12283"><span id="SPAN-12284">10.35.2.6.&nbsp;<b id="B-12285">Establish
    the Right Atmosphere.</b>&nbsp;The right atmosphere promotes two-way communication
    between a leader and Airman. To establish a relaxed atmosphere, offer the
    Airman a seat or something to drink. Sit in a chair facing the Airman rather
    than behind a desk because a desk can be perceived as a barrier. Some
    situations, however, make an informal atmosphere inappropriate. For example, a
    more formal atmosphere is normally used to give specific guidance and
    reinforces the leader's rank, position, and authority.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12286"><span id="SPAN-12287">10.35.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-12288">Conduct the Counseling Session.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12289"><span id="SPAN-12290">Be
    flexible when conducting a counseling session. Often, counseling for a specific
    incident occurs spontaneously as leaders encounter Airmen in their daily
    activities. Good leaders take advantage of naturally occurring events to
    provide Airmen with feedback. Even when you have not prepared for formal
    counseling, you should follow the four basic components of a counseling
    session:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12291"><span id="SPAN-12292">10.35.3.1.<b id="B-12293">&nbsp;Open
    the Counseling Session.</b>&nbsp;The best way to open a counseling session is
    to clearly state the purpose. Establish the preferred setting early in the
    session by inviting the Airman to speak.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12294"><span id="SPAN-12295">10.35.3.2.<b id="B-12296">&nbsp;Discuss
    the Issues.&nbsp;</b>Attempt to develop a mutual understanding of the issues
    with the Airman. This is best developed by letting the Airman do most of the
    talking. Use active listening; respond and question without dominating the
    conversation. Aim to help the Airman better understand the subject of the
    counseling, such as duty performance, a problem situation and the impact, or
    potential areas for growth. Both you and the Airman should provide examples or
    cite specific observations to reduce the perception that is unnecessarily
    biased or judgmental. However, when the issue is substandard performance, make
    it clear how the performance did not meet the standard and then develop a plan
    of action.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12297"><span id="SPAN-12298">10.35.3.3.<b id="B-12299">&nbsp;Develop
    a Plan of Action.&nbsp;</b>A plan of action identifies a method for achieving a
    desired result and specifies what the Airman must do to reach the goals set
    during the counseling session. The plan of action must be specific. The plan of
    action should show the Airman how to modify or maintain his or her behavior.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12300"><span id="SPAN-12301">10.35.3.4.<b id="B-12302">&nbsp;Record
    and Close the Session.&nbsp;</b>Documentation serves as a reference to the
    agreed-upon plan of action and the Airman's accomplishments, improvements,
    personal preferences, or problems. To close the session, summarize key points
    and ask if the Airman understands the plan of action. Invite the Airman to
    review the plan of action and what you, as the leader, expect from him or her.
    With the Airman, establish any follow-up measures necessary to support the successful
    implementation of the plan of action. These may include providing the Airman
    with resources and time, periodically assessing the plan, and following through
    on referrals. Schedule any future meetings, at least tentatively, before
    dismissing the Airman.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12303"><span id="SPAN-12304">10.35.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-12305">Follow up.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12306"><span id="SPAN-12307">The
    counseling process does not end with the counseling session. Follow up
    continues through implementation of the plan of action and evaluation of
    results. After counseling, support the Airman as he or she implements the plan
    of action. Support may include teaching, coaching, or providing time and
    resources. Observe and assess this process and possibly modify the plan to meet
    goals. Appropriate measures after counseling include follow-up counseling,
    making referrals, informing the chain of command, and taking corrective
    measures.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12308"><b id="B-12309"><span id="SPAN-12310">10.36. Leveraging Diversity.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-12311"><span id="SPAN-12312">Our
    work environment today is more diverse than ever. The Air Force team is
    comprised of military, civilians, and contractors. Leaders can find themselves
    dealing with a workforce ranging from 18-year-olds to those with 18 or more
    years of experience. The challenge is to incorporate everyone's specific
    talents into a cohesive and optimal workforce. We must recognize that people
    are vital to an organization's success. Consequently, we need to understand the
    motivations and interests of this diverse workforce.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12313"><span id="SPAN-12314">10.36.1.
    People are motivated for their reasons, not yours. What sparks interest and
    passion in one person does not necessarily ignite the next person. Effective
    leaders take time to recognize what excites others, leverages their talent to
    the organization, and cultivate a work culture that recognizes and appreciates
    differing perspectives and approaches to solving problems. Consider this: the
    Air Force attracts people from every aspect of society, culture, and social
    status. When, where, and how someone was raised impacts their value system.
    None of these variables are under a supervisor's direct control. Supervisors
    cannot change someone's inherent characteristics, but they can change how to
    lead these people as a cohesive team. Foremost, leaders must create a
    hospitable climate that promotes respect and inclusion. This will reduce
    dysfunctional tension and increase team productivity. Specifically, how can
    this be achieved?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12315"><span id="SPAN-12316">10.36.2.
    The first step in leading a diverse organization is to form common ground or a
    shared set of assumptions, which will form the framework within to communicate.
    The common ground is the organization itself, the vision, goals, rules,
    regulations, processes, and procedures that govern what the unit does to
    achieve mission requirements. Clear guidelines improve communication, reduce
    confusion, provide purpose, and define desired outcomes. A team must have a
    clear sense of direction or else there will be mass confusion with everyone
    going in different directions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12317"><span id="SPAN-12318">10.36.3.
    Having established common ground, we must increase awareness and expel
    stereotypes. Examples include younger employees are  wet behind the ears,  know
    nothing, have no respect or loyalty, lack experience, have no credibility, and
    cannot be trusted with much responsibility. At the other end of the social
    spectrum, older employees are considered less motivated to work hard, are
    nothing but deadwood, resistant to change, cannot learn new methods/technology,
    plateau at 40, should be fired after 50, and are  fire proof.  Stereotypes
    ignore differences among the individuals in a group. The workplace has no room
    for such stereotypes. Instead, leaders must acknowledge the richness and benefits
    of diversity.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12319"><span id="SPAN-12320">10.36.4.
    People are different. There is no way to make them fit into a single mold, nor
    is there any reason to. We do not live in a world of carbon-copied people. To
    effectively manage a diverse workforce, we must acknowledge differences. However,
    we should focus more on what we have in common.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12321"><span id="SPAN-12322">10.36.5.
    Use everyone's experiences and background as a resource. Diversity of
    experience and background ensures diverse ways of looking at problems. Managing
    our workforce diversity can result in higher productivity, improved
    performance, more creativity, more innovations, and reduced stress. Giving
    emphasis to diversity without threatening our unity is the proper way to
    strengthen the ties that bind the team together. Sensitivity, mutual respect,
    and common trust coupled with communication are the prime ingredients to
    integrating our Airmen.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12323"><span id="SPAN-12324">10.36.6.
    Former Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, General John P. Jumper stated,  Air
    Force diversity is a critical warfighting and readiness issue. Maximizing the benefits
    of diversity is a mission imperative. We expect Air Force leaders to challenge
    any policy, practice, or process that limits the growth and development of
    potential leaders from all groups.  Industry studies have consistently revealed
    that heterogeneous or diverse groups are more innovative than homogeneous
    groups because they view improvement opportunities from multiple perspectives.
    Managing diversity is determining which differences matter in enriching a
    product or service. Productivity is an outcome of respect and inclusion. Former
    Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force, General Ronald Fogleman said,  People are the
    assets that determine our success or failure. If you are to be a good leader,
    you have to cultivate your skills in the arena of personal relations.  The
    skilled leader deals effectively with all races, nationalities, cultures,
    disabilities, ages, and gender.</span></p>

    full range of leadership behaviors is essential in today's complex world.
    Therefore, developing full range leadership potential throughout the workforce
    has become a principal initiative in several of today's most successful
    organizations, to include the U.S. Air Force. Though the leadership theories of
    the past were very successful, today's Air Force depends on highly effective
    Airmen with the flexibility and capability to operate throughout a spectrum of
    leadership styles. FRLD was adopted because the best parts of past leadership
    theories are combined.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12334"><span id="SPAN-12335">10.37.1.
    FRLD is unique and requires us to view leadership as a system made up of three
    core elements: the leader, the follower, and the situation. The components of
    the FRLD system are interdependent of one another. Its success relies not only
    on the leader's actions, but also the follower and the situation. FRLD requires
    today's leaders to consider the follower and each situation and be willing to:</span></p>

    <p id="P-12348"><span id="SPAN-12349">10.37.2. The FRLD Model
    (Figure 10.4) includes five leadership behaviors ranging from the passive, less
    effective Laissez-Faire behavior to the more active and effective
    Transformational Leadership behavior.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12350"><span id="SPAN-12351">10.37.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-12352">Laissez-Faire.&nbsp;</b>Laissez-faire
    leaders view the development and needs of their subordinates as someone else s
    concern. They tend to pass on and abandon their responsibilities and remain
    indifferent toward important issues. They are hesitant to make decisions and
    are usually absent from their place of work, which negatively affects
    relationships with peers and subordinates.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12353"><span id="SPAN-12354">10.37.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-12355">Management by Exception-Passive.&nbsp;</b>This
    leadership behavior is the&nbsp;<i id="I-12356"> if it isn t broke, don t fix it </i>&nbsp;leadership
    style. Here, leaders elect to sit back, observe, and wait for things to go
    wrong before taking action. They intervene only when policies or rules are
    broken. Management by Exception-Passive is a little more effective than
    Laissez-Faire because subordinates know that leadership will hold them
    accountable if they fail to meet standards of performance or comply with
    policies and procedures.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12357"><span id="SPAN-12358"><img border="0" width="566" height="425" src="afh1_files/image232.png" id="IMG-12359"></span></p>

    <p id="P-12362"><span id="SPAN-12363">10.37.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-12364">Management
    by Exception-Active.&nbsp;</b>This leadership behavior ensures leaders keep
    personnel and processes in control. They monitor and govern subordinates
    through forced compliance with rules, regulations, and expectations for meeting
    performance standards. Management by Exception-Active exists in a structured
    system with detailed instructions, careful observation, and very&nbsp;<i id="I-12365">active</i>&nbsp;supervision.
    Furthermore, this leadership behavior reduces organizational uncertainties,
    avoids unnecessary risks, and ensures important goals are being achieved. This
    transactional leadership behavior reduces the temptation for employees to avoid
    their duties or act unethically and aids members in meeting defined performance
    objectives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12366"><span id="SPAN-12367">10.37.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-12368">Transactional
    Leadership and Contingent Rewards.&nbsp;</b>Transactional leadership and
    contingent rewards involve the constructive&nbsp;<i id="I-12369">transaction</i>&nbsp;between
    a leader and his or her followers. These transactions are  contracts' where the
    leader sets goals, identifies ways for the subordinate to reach these goals,
    and supports the follower along the way. The follower is then required to
    perform their assigned tasks to a specified performance level and, when they
    achieve their leader's expectations, the leader reinforces the positive
    behavior by providing a reward. In other words, the reward is contingent upon
    the follower performing assigned tasks to expectations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12370"><span id="SPAN-12371">10.37.2.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-12372">Transformational
    Leadership.</b>&nbsp;The transformational leader offers followers a vision and
    inspires their mission. This type of leadership inspires followers to exceed
    their goals and promotes positive, meaningful changes. There are four
    components of transformational leadership, called the&nbsp;<i id="I-12373">4 I s</i>:
    Individualized Consideration, Intellectual Stimulation, Idealized Influence,
    and Inspirational Motivation.</span></p>

    Consideration (<i id="I-12377">Nurturing</i>).&nbsp;</b>Individualized consideration is
    where leaders treat their followers as individuals with different needs,
    abilities, and aspirations and not just as a part of a group of subordinates.
    They empathize with and support each follower while maintaining healthy
    communication. Using Individualized Consideration, leaders  nurture  followers
    by acting as mentor or coach.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12378"><span id="SPAN-12379">10.37.2.5.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-12380">Intellectual
    Stimulation (<i id="I-12381">Thinking</i>).&nbsp;</b>Intellectual Stimulation is the degree
    to which a leader values their subordinates' rationality and intellect, seeking
    different perspectives and considering opposing points of view. Using
    Intellectual Stimulation, leaders stimulate and encourage creativity in their
    followers, encourage followers to be independent thinkers, and are not afraid
    to take risks and solicit ideas from their followers.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12382"><span id="SPAN-12383">10.37.2.5.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-12384">Inspirational
    Motivation (<i id="I-12385">Charming</i>).&nbsp;</b>This leader behavior involves developing
    and articulating visions that paint an optimistic and enthusiastic picture of
    the future that is appealing and inspiring to followers. These visions elevate
    performance expectations and inspire followers to put forth extra effort to
    achieve the leader's vision.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12386"><span id="SPAN-12387">10.37.2.5.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-12388">Idealized
    Influence (<i id="I-12389">Influencing</i>).&nbsp;</b>Transformational leaders are
    charismatic and act as positive role models that  walk the walk.  They exhibit
    high levels of moral behavior, virtues, and character strengths, as well as a
    strong work ethic. They represent the organization's values, beliefs, and
    purpose in both words and actions. They set aside personal interests for the
    sake of the group.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12390"><span id="SPAN-12391">10.37.3.
    Developing these five leadership behaviors begins by understanding each of them
    and knowing when, or when not, to apply them. In addition, possessing the
    flexibility and capability to implement each style is critical to successfully
    leading others, depending on the follower and the situation. Though a more
    passive approach may be appropriate at times, transformational leaders actively
    and effectively develop the followers today to become the leaders of tomorrow.</span></p>

    <p id="P-12401"><span id="SPAN-12402">Mentoring
    is a leadership obligation and responsibility. Through mentoring, senior
    leaders pass on their experience and wisdom to junior members as well as
    philosophy, traditions, shared values, quality, and lessons learned. Mentoring
    provides the framework for the professional development of competent, future
    Air Force leaders. Mentoring is an ongoing process and perhaps the most
    powerful method leadership can use to shape the future. A mentor is a trusted
    advisor, teacher, counselor, friend, parent, and/or the more senior person in
    the relationship. In organizations, mentorship can apply to all leaders and
    supervisors who are responsible for getting their work done through other
    people. The assisted individual is usually referred to as the prot g : a
    student or pupil who learns from the mentor. Understanding mentoring principles
    is essential to practical implementation.</span></p>

    <p id="P-12469"><span id="SPAN-12470">An
    effective mentor must first lead by example. When serving as a role model, make
    no mistake that actions speak much louder than words. Mentoring requires the
    mentor and prot g  to spend a significant amount of time together. Here, the
    prot g  is constantly observing and learning from the mentor's words and
    actions. The opportunity to see how the mentor deals with a variety of
    situations is an important part of the process. Therefore, the mentor must show
    the prot g  how a mature professional handles various challenges and
    opportunities. In turn, prot g's must be willing to learn, seek assistance, and
    apply what they have learned.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12471"><span id="SPAN-12472">10.39.2.<b id="B-12473">&nbsp;Empathize.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12474"><span id="SPAN-12475">Mentoring
    involves much more than merely teaching. Mentors must empathize, showing
    genuine compassion for their prot g s. Mentors who remember what it was like
    when they were new and inexperienced are more effective in assisting others in
    their professional development. Empathy cultivates strong bonds between mentors
    and prot g's and fosters the mutual commitment that exemplifies mentoring.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12476"><span id="SPAN-12477">10.39.3.<b id="B-12478">&nbsp;Nurture.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12479"><span id="SPAN-12480">Nurturing
    also emphasizes a caring attitude. Like a farmer and his or her crops, the
    mentor nurtures the prot g . One cannot expect to sow a rich crop without
    investing ample time, patience, and labor. Certainly these points seem rather
    obvious, but are often the most neglected elements. Some mentors often find
    themselves too busy to provide the time and effort to effectively mentor their
    prot g s. Therefore, we must not expect an expert-level performance from
    someone who has not received appropriate amounts of attention, training, and
    time from a mentor. Remember, for people to apply, internalize, and value what
    they have learned takes time.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12481"><span id="SPAN-12482">10.39.4.<b id="B-12483">&nbsp;Teach.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12484"><span id="SPAN-12485">Many
    people, regardless of their knowledge and experience level, find teaching
    uncomfortable and extremely stressful. Thankfully, some time-tested methods
    provide a solid benchmark for instruction. Consider these five simple steps
    when teaching and training prot g s: (1) organize the material into logical;
    systematic, units of manageable size; (2) correct errors immediately; (3)
    frequently review previously covered material and relate the material to the
    current lesson; (4) include practical exercises to help the prot g  exercise
    the newfound knowledge; and (5) evaluate the prot g s' comprehension often,
    formally and informally, and provide detailed feedback on their progress.</span></p>

    <p id="P-12489"><span id="SPAN-12490">Mentors
    must first be organized before helping others become organized. Hence, a
    systematic, methodical approach is essential. An organized mentor knows from
    the very beginning what he or she wants to achieve, focusing every aspect of
    the process on this goal. The time and effort spent organizing thoughts and
    materials into a logical, building-block sequential plan of lessons aimed at a
    precisely defined target pays big dividends in the form of improved learning
    and developmental experiences for the prot g .</span></p>

    <p id="P-12494"><span id="SPAN-12495">Mentoring
    is a two-way communication process that requires mentors to actively listen to the
    prot g s' questions and provide useful and timely responses. There may be times
    when the prot g  is reluctant to ask a particular question. Therefore,
    effective mentors must remain alert to recognize nonverbal behaviors and subtle
    communication cues. Rather than sitting back and waiting for the prot g  to ask
    questions, be proactive. Anticipate the needs, problems, and concerns of
    prot g's and take care of them immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>

    acquaintance. Genuine mentoring encompasses an element of inspiration.
    Inspirational mentors have a profound impact on their prot g's that encourages
    them to transform into a more improved being. Inspiration is one of the
    characteristics that distinguishes leaders from managers. The best mentors most
    likely become the best leaders because they are able to inspire others.</span></p>

    <p id="P-12516"><span id="SPAN-12517">Strategic
    leadership plays a critical role in propelling today's Air Force through and
    beyond the 21st century. Strategic leadership is such a broad concept, that we
    may not be able to define, but we can certainly recognize strategic leadership
    in action. Noel Tichy, Director of the Global Leadership Program at the Ross
    School of Business, offers a comprehensible depiction as to what a strategic
    leader is:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12518"><i id="I-12519"><span id="SPAN-12520"> Strategic leaders guide the achievement of their organizational
    vision within a larger enterprise by directing policy and strategy, building
    consensus, acquiring and allocating resources, influencing organizational
    culture, and shaping complex and ambiguous external environments. They lead by
    example to build effective organizations, grow the next generation of leaders,
    energize subordinates, seek opportunities to advance organizational goals, and
    balance personal and professional demands. </span></i></p>

    <p id="P-12524"><b id="B-12525"><span id="SPAN-12526">10.41. Components of Strategic Leadership:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-12527"><span id="SPAN-12528">10.41.1.<b id="B-12529">&nbsp;</b>Enlisted
    leaders apply the strategic leadership components of core values, competencies,
    and actions at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels every day.
    Leadership at the tactical level is predominantly direct and face-to-face. As
    leaders ascend the organizational ladder to the operational level, leadership
    responsibilities become more complex and sophisticated. Strategic leaders have
    a responsibility to large organizations and systems and are expected to
    conceptualize and integrate a variety of issues to accomplish the mission.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12530"><span id="SPAN-12531">10.41.2.<b id="B-12532">&nbsp;</b>Core
    values form the foundation of leadership (paragraph 10.12), coupled with
    competencies (personal, people/team, and institutional leadership) and actions.
    Personal leadership focuses on interpersonal relations that directly influence
    human behavior and values. People/team leadership involves more interpersonal
    relations and team relationships. Leaders using this competency tailor
    resources to organizations and programs. Institutional leadership is about
    establishing structure, allocating resources appropriately, and articulating
    the organizational vision.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12533"><span id="SPAN-12534">10.41.3.<b id="B-12535">&nbsp;</b>Actions
    include training and educational activities designed to develop strategic
    leadership abilities. Early career development focuses on personal competencies
    at the tactical level. At the operational stage, personal leadership continues,
    but the Air Force begins to emphasize people/team leadership development and
    introduces institutional leadership competencies. At the strategic level, the
    greatest emphasis is on developing institutional leadership competencies,
    primarily through education designed to help leaders form accurate frames of
    reference, make sound decisions, uncover underlying connections between general
    issues, and think creatively, innovatively, and critically about new solutions
    and options.</span></p>

    the strategic level, Airmen must combine highly developed occupational
    capabilities with competencies gained earlier in their careers to lead and
    direct exceptionally complex and multi-tiered organizations. Strategic leaders
    must understand Air Force missions and how operational capabilities and Airmen
    are integrated to achieve synergistic results and desired effects. Strategic
    leaders are also expected to demonstrate a highly developed and insightful

    impact on the organization. They fully understand their role in shaping climate
    and culture through vision, policy, communication, education, coaching,
    mentoring, and personal example.</span></p>

    commands, or guides a group or activity.  These are simple definitions, but the
    implications of poor or ineffective leadership are devastating to mission
    success. Given the authority, anyone can command. Leading, however, is a
    delicate art calling for people-oriented attributes that many find difficult to
    develop and impossible to acquire. With determination and practical experience,
    you can develop your leadership skill sets. Commanders depend on
    noncommissioned officers to lead Airmen and accomplish the mission. This
    chapter discussed the art of leadership, effective leadership,
    interrelationship of leadership and management, leadership qualities, and the
    concept of vision, and provided an overview on empowerment and learning. Also
    provided was information on leadership flexibility and followership, dealing
    effectively with change, the critical relationship between leadership and core
    values, mentoring, and counseling. These concepts are fundamental to the
    mission of the Air Force, as well as the careers and futures of the enlisted
    force.</span></p>

    The officer and enlisted evaluations, and civilian appraisals deal directly
    with the Air Force's most precious resource people. Supervisors must help their
    subordinates understand their strengths and weaknesses and how their efforts
    contribute to the mission. Supervisors must employ the officer and enlisted
    evaluation systems, and civilian performance program in everyday situations to
    help develop their subordinates. This chapter addresses the importance of
    correctly using the officer and enlisted evaluation systems, and civilian
    performance program, by identifying responsibilities, outlining the performance
    feedback process, and provides additional information as outlined in governing
    AFIs 36-2406,&nbsp;<i id="I-12570">Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems</i>&nbsp;and

    <p id="P-12580"><b id="B-12581"><span id="SPAN-12582">11.2. Purpose.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-12583"><span id="SPAN-12584">The
    Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems have varied purposes. The first is to
    establish performance standards and expectations for ratees, meaningful
    feedback on how well the ratee is meeting those expectations, and direction on
    how to better meet those established standards and expectations. The second is
    to provide a reliable, long-term, cumulative record of performance and
    promotion potential based on that performance. The third is to provide officer
    Central Selection Boards, senior NCO evaluation boards, the Weighted Airman
    Promotion System, and other personnel managers' with sound information to
    assist in identifying the best qualified officers and enlisted personnel for
    promotion, as well as other personnel management decisions. The fourth is to
    document in the permanent record any substantiated allegation of a sex-related
    offense against an Airman, regardless of grade, that results in conviction by
    courts-martial, non-judicial punishment, or other punitive administrative
    action.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12585"><span id="SPAN-12586">11.2.1.
    To accomplish these purposes, the evaluation system focuses on performance. How
    well the individual does his or her job, and the qualities the individual
    brings to the job, are of paramount importance to the Air Force. Performance is
    most important for successful mission accomplishment and important for
    development of skills and leadership abilities and in determining who will be
    selected for advancement through assignments, promotions, and other personnel
    actions. The evaluation system emphasizes the importance of performance in
    several ways--using periodic performance feedback, as the basis for formal
    evaluations, and, for officers, through performance-based promotion
    recommendations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-12587"><span id="SPAN-12588">11.2.2.
    Effective evaluators must have an adequate understanding of Officer Evaluation
    System (OES), Enlisted Evaluation System (EES), or both, depending on who they
    supervise. OES/EES training was implemented in May 96 to help supervisors
    fulfill their evaluation responsibilities. Unit commanders are responsible for
    ensuring all firsttime supervisors receive mandatory OES/EES training (as
    appropriate for their position) within 60 days of being appointed as a rater.
    Additionally, Air Force members should receive annual recurring OES/EES
    training. How and when this training is conducted is at the discretion of the
    unit commander. To assist commanders, OES/EES Training Guides are located on
    the myPers Website.</span></p>

    abusive sexual contact), Article 125 (forcible sodomy, which is forced oral or
    anal sex, and bestiality), Article 120a (stalking), Article 120b (rape and

    Officer Selection Record). The evaluation becomes a referral for the OPR, EPR,
    and Training Report. Comments are also required on Airmen who have been
    convicted of a  reportable civilian offense  that: 1) is a sexual offense that
    is the same as, or closely related to, Uniform Code of Military Justice,
    Articles 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, 125, or attempts to commit any of those
    offenses; 2) carries a possible sentence of confinement for more than one year,

    A rater is not required to comment on the conviction in a current report if,
    during a previous rating period, the rater already commented on the underlying
    misconduct that ultimately resulted in the conviction. For example: In a case
    where a member is arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence by
    off-base officials who decline to waive jurisdiction, the member's commander
    issues the member an Letter of Reprimand based on the evidence, and then
    comments on the Driving Under the Influence Letter of Reprimand in the ratee s
    next evaluation. Then, the downtown prosecution results in a conviction during
    a future reporting period. In such a case, the rater is not required to comment
    on the Driving Under the Influence conviction because the underlying misconduct
    that led to the conviction was already addressed in a previous
    evaluation.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Air National Guard), the final approval authority can either approve the
    exception, allowing the exclusion of any comments in the EPR, OPR, Training
    Report, and Promotion Recommendation Form, or deny the request, resulting in
    the mandatory inclusion of comments regarding the ratee's criminal
    behavior.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-13038"><span id="SPAN-13039">11.7.3.1.2.

    inclusion of any such comments would unduly harm the ratee. Upon final
    decision, the final approval authority will forward the waiver documentation to

    are too vague. Examples of valid comments are  Master Sergeant Smith drove

    Commanders at every level have an even greater responsibility to create a
    healthy climate in their command. Additionally, they are responsible for
    ensuring adherence to Sexual Assault Prevention Program directives. Command
    climate, just like organizational climate, is the perception of a unit s
    environment by its members. Commanders are ultimately responsible for the good
    order and discipline in their unit and have unique responsibility and authority
    to ensure good order and discipline. Therefore, evaluators must take this
    special responsibility and authority into consideration when evaluating a
    commander's effectiveness in ensuring a healthy command climate. &nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-13061"><span id="SPAN-13062">ACA
    is formal communication between a rater and ratee to communicate
    responsibility, accountability, Air Force culture, an Airman's critical role in
    support of the mission, individual readiness, and performance feedback on
    expectations regarding duty performance and how well the ratee is meeting those
    expectations to include information to assist the ratee in achieving success.
    It is intended to increase Airmen interaction and support at all levels. If
    done correctly, mentorship will create and sustain a culture of belonging. The
    ACA is also intended to provide Airmen an opportunity to discuss their personal
    and professional goals. Raters document the session on the ACA worksheet and
    use the Performance Feedback in Section VI to assess or discuss the objectives,
    standards, behavior, and performance with the ratee. Providing this information
    helps an individual contribute to positive communication, improve performance,
    and grow professionally. The following information applies to all military
    personnel.</span></p>

    Air Force and Air Reserve Component personnel. If an individual requests an ACA
    session, the rater will provide one within 30 days of receipt of the request,
    provided 60 days have passed since the last ACA session. Do not prepare an ACA
    when a ratee is a captive, patient, prisoner, absent without leave, etc. For
    student officers receiving AF Forms 475, ACA is not required, but may be given
    at the discretion of the commander of the school. For student enlisted
    personnel, in approved initial skills training or advanced skills training
    courses an ACA is not required, but may be given at the discretion of the
    commander of the school. For those performance evaluations completed on
    non-rated initial skills training or advanced skills training course students,
    academic progress reports, such as the AETC Form 156 Student Training Report,
    captured in the Technical Training Management System or an equivalent document
    utilized by non-AETC institutions of instruction, will serve in-lieu of the
    mandatory mid-term ACA. ACAs are&nbsp;<b id="B-13127"><i id="I-13128">not&nbsp;</i></b>required for

    by telephone only in unusual circumstances where face-to-face sessions are
    impractical, such as when the rater and ratee are geographically separated or
    the rater and/or ratee is on extended TDY. When a telephonic session is

    supervision begins (identifying initial or follow-up ACA sessions as required)
    and again halfway between the time supervision began and the projected
    performance report close-out date (identifying mid-term ACA session
    requirement). This notice serves to remind raters that an ACA session is due;

    <p id="P-13143"><span id="SPAN-13144">11.13.2.
    Since the ratee shares the responsibility to ensure ACA sessions are conducted,

    of history and has been used in the United States by both public and private
    industries for many years. Today, most successful companies have effective OJT
    programs because OJT works. Well-trained workers mean higher production,
    positive morale, greater profits, and higher wages. Air Force training costs
    millions of dollars annually, for good reason. To accomplish the mission,
    whether that means satellites in orbit, planes in the air, reports to higher
    headquarters, or vehicles on the road, training is a must. In addition to OJT,
    training management covers upgrade training, skill levels, retraining, and
    training responsibilities, forms, and documentation. Finally, each base
    education office provides Service members with educational opportunities in
    which they may voluntarily participate during off-duty time or other times, as
    authorized by military policies. The base education office also provides
    information on financial assistance and commissioning programs.</span></p>

    offer and award job-related associate in applied science degrees and other
    academic credentials that enhance mission readiness, contribute to recruiting,
    assist in retention and support the career transitions of Air Force enlisted
    members. Community College of the Air Force awards the associate in applied

    Guard, and Air Force Reserve Command. Community College of the Air Force offers
    over 70 degree programs in 5 general areas: (1) Aircraft and Missile
    Maintenance; (2) Allied Health; (3) Electronics and Telecommunications; (4) Logistics
    and Resources; and (5) Public and Support Services. Enlisted Airmen may only
    participate in degree programs specifically designed for their Air Force
    occupational specialty. Community College of the Air Force also offers programs
    and other academic credentials that support professional development,
    professional certification, and recognition opportunities.</span></p>

    The Community College of the Air Force was activated in 1972 to gain academic
    recognition for formal technical training conducted by Air Force schools. From
    1980 to 2004, Community College of the Air Force was independently accredited
    by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.
    Today, Community College of the Air Force shares in Air University's regional accreditation

    Applied Science Degree.</b>&nbsp;Associate degrees earned in professional,
    technical or terminal programs are frequently called associate of applied
    science degrees. The educational standard for the associate in applied science
    degree is to be designed for those students who plan to seek employment based
    upon the competencies and skills attained through these programs and to offer
    the academic, technical and professional knowledge and skills required for job
    acquisition, retention and advancement. While not designed to meet the needs of
    students who transfer to a four-year institution, portions of these programs
    may do so. Community College of the Air Force offers and awards the associate
    in applied science degree designed to provide graduates with knowledge, skills
    and theoretical background for enhanced performance as technicians within their
    respective Air Force occupational specialty. This is accomplished by combining
    collegiate credit earned through completed formal technical training courses
    delivered at affiliated military schools and general education courses
    completed from accredited civilian colleges. Since enlisted Airmen are
    constantly relocating in performance of their duties, Community College of the
    Air Force provides a means for them to complete degree requirements regardless
    of where they are assigned. One way the Community College of the Air Force
    helps enlisted Airmen to progress toward completing degree requirements while
    deployed, on temporary duty, or at multiple duty locations is through General
    Education Mobile. General Education Mobile identifies civilian colleges that
    provide distance learning courses approved by the Community College of the Air
    Force in meeting degree program general education requirements. This prevents
    Airmen from completing unnecessary courses that would not apply toward degree
    graduation requirements, eliminates waste of military tuition assistance funds,
    and prevents wasting Airmen's time and efforts.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-13637"><span id="SPAN-13638">12.12.5.
    Enlisted Airmen are automatically registered in the Community College of the
    Air Force degree program designed for their Air Force occupational specialty
    during the fourth week of Basic Military Training. Each degree program consists
    of 64 semester hours and combines Air Force formal technical training and
    education with a core of general education requirements obtained from
    accredited civilian colleges or nationally recognized examination programs. To
    graduate, students must complete the 64 semester-hour academic requirements,
    hold at least the Journeyman 5-skill level (or equivalent), and have a minimum
    of 16 semester hours of Community College of the Air Force residency credit
    applied toward the degree program. Residency is defined as credit earned in a
    Community College of the Air Force affiliated school or credit awarded for
    occupational specialty progression. Table 12.1 identifies the requirements for
    the typical Community College of the Air Force degree and the semester-hour
    requirements in each subject area.</span></p>

    accredited colleges to be applied toward specific degree program requirements.
    General education courses accepted in transfer from civilian colleges must meet
    Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges

    <p id="P-14052"><b id="B-14053"><span id="SPAN-14054">13.2. Introduction.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-14055"><span id="SPAN-14056">As leaders, we must
    develop effective teams to accomplish the mission. While building effective
    teams, we must cultivate a healthy team spirit. The spirit in which a team
    operates influences every stage of team development and can ultimately
    determine whether mission goals are met. A healthy team spirit is the engine
    that runs high performance teams. Five critical attributes are present in all
    healthy teams: trust, ethical behavior, critical judgment, sharing, and
    cooperation. While each is essential in building a healthy team spirit, trust
    is the core of all healthy team interaction.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14057"><b id="B-14058"><span id="SPAN-14059">13.3.</span></b><span id="SPAN-14060">&nbsp;<b id="B-14061">Trust:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14062"><span id="SPAN-14063">13.3.1. Trust is
    essential in forming any good relationship; teamwork requires good
    relationships with a high degree of trust. Team members must share mutual
    confidence in the integrity and ability of teammates. They also need to feel
    comfortable enough to take risks, think outside the box, and share their
    thoughts and ideas without fear of being shut down or discounted. Freedom to
    communicate openly, honestly, and directly within the group is the hallmark of
    a trust-based team. Individuals must understand the importance of utilizing
    effective communication skills to develop the level of trust needed for the
    teams to grow. These communication skills include positive listening habits
    such as maintaining good eye contact, recalling essential information, allowing
    individuals to speak freely with minimal to no interruptions, as well as
    responding in the appropriate manner. In her book&nbsp;<i id="I-14064">"Teams at
    Work,"</i>&nbsp;author, organizational consultant, and Institute for
    Planning and Development founder Dr. Suzanne Zoglio wrote  Nothing reduces
    trust in a group faster than members saying one thing within the group and
    something else outside the group. When members are assertive enough to say what
    they need to say directly to the appropriate people and to refrain from talking
    behind each other's backs, trust is enhanced. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14065"><span id="SPAN-14066">13.3.2. Team members may
    respond to other team members they do not trust by alienating them, ignoring
    their inputs, and withholding vital information. Trust is important in creating
    a healthy team because information needs to be shared and accepted in good
    faith. Feedback must also be exchanged between members in an open and sincere
    manner without fear of harsh criticism. Without trust, a team's efforts can be
    sabotaged and progress brought to a grinding halt. Leaders can promote a
    trusting atmosphere by being trustworthy and by trusting their workers.
    Additionally, by valuing individual differences and encouraging open and honest
    communication, leaders empower their teams to solve problems innovatively
    through a shared sense of collaboration that is free of self-preservation and
    one's own personal interest.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14067"><span id="SPAN-14068">13.3.3. While there are
    many strategies that can be utilized for building trust within a team, leaders
    should focus their efforts on leading by example and developing a trusting
    relationship within the team; communicate openly and honestly; know team
    members and establish a good rapport with team members; discourage cliques or
    divisions within the team; and finally, discuss trust issues with the team.
    Remember, trust is earned and can be lost.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14069"><b id="B-14070"><span id="SPAN-14071">13.4. Ethical Behavior.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-14072"><span id="SPAN-14073">We lose trust in people
    because of behaviors that reduce our respect for them. Such behaviors are
    usually unethical and kill the spirit of the team. Ethical behaviors, on the
    other hand, conform to accepted principles of right and wrong that govern our
    profession. Team members who exhibit honesty, integrity, and concern for doing
    what is right behave ethically. In his book&nbsp;<i id="I-14074">"Essentials of
    Management,"</i>&nbsp;author and Professor of Management, College of
    Business at Rochester Institute of Technology, Andrew J. DuBrin said  To a
    strong team player, getting the group task accomplished is more important than
    receiving individual recognition.  He also outlined the underlying reasons as
    to why unethical behavior arises in the team. The primary cause can be closely
    contributed to one's  values .</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14075"><span id="SPAN-14076">13.4.1.
    Ethics and values operate as a synchronous unit and is often driven by
    individual personal interests within the team. Teams will often experience
    turmoil when self-interest or greed enters the team; unconscious biases may
    lead to stereotypes and affect the judgement of the team; and the likelihood
    that a team may rationalize or make unethical decisions to complete the task or
    reach their goal. When teams operate with high standards and moral values, they
    increase trust and therefore work cohesively.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14077"><b id="B-14078"><span id="SPAN-14079">13.5. Sharing Information:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-14080"><span id="SPAN-14081">13.5.1. If teams are to
    succeed, they must openly share information inside and outside the group. This
    sharing of information involves both active listening and talking. According to
    Professor DuBrin,  Information sharing help other team members do their job
    well and also communicates concern for their welfare.  Leaders' best
    demonstrate concern for the welfare of other team members when they actively
    listen.  The active listener strives to grasp both the facts and feelings
    behind what is being said,  Professor DuBrin added. Active listening and
    information sharing encourage positive, open, and sincere communication among
    team members.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14082"><span id="SPAN-14083">13.5.2.
    Teams must communicate. Team members need to safely assert themselves and share
    their ideas. Teams that don t allow honest, open sharing quickly lose their
    effectiveness. As a result, some team members may purposely withhold vital
    information or disengage from the team. This may cause confusion, frustration,
    and the inability to complete tasks within teams. While sharing information
    between team members is essential in producing effective, well-thought-out
    plans. Also essential is for the leader to share information with team members.
    When leaders hold on to information, they can create an inaccurate, incomplete,
    or totally wrong picture of the expected outcome to team members. Information
    sharing yields better results. Leaders can increase team success by giving
    members complete access to all necessary data, discouraging the discounting of
    ideas and feelings, and encouraging the practice of active listening and
    valuing individual differences.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14084"><b id="B-14085"><span id="SPAN-14086">13.6. Critical Judgment.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-14087"><span id="SPAN-14088">When we share
    information, someone is bound to criticize our ideas. For a team to be
    effective, constructive criticism should be accepted and encouraged. Professor
    DuBrin said,  A high performance team demands sincere and tactful criticism
    among members. The willingness to accept constructive criticism increases
    self-awareness and improves team effectiveness.  Critical judgment enables
    teams to accept intra-group feedback (criticism) and outside evaluations,
    necessary to examine processes and practices. By using critical feedback, teams
    can redirect their focus and energy, and correct problems quickly rather than
    letting them intensify.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14089"><span id="SPAN-14090">13.6.1.
    Giving constructive criticism occurs when teams focus on the problem or
    behavior and not necessarily personal opinions; when the negative feedback is
    given at the appropriate time and is not introduced during a later stage of
    team development; and lastly when the individual is given an opportunity to
    observe and self-correct the problem. Critical judgment is essential to ensure
    teams consistently focus in the right direction.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14091"><b id="B-14092"><span id="SPAN-14093">13.7. Cooperation:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-14094"><span id="SPAN-14095">13.7.1. Cooperation is critical if teams are to
    combine diverse backgrounds, skills, and approaches to meet the challenges,
    customer requirements, and mission changes. Cooperation yields synergistic
    results and reduces the time it takes to reach a desired outcome. Dr. Zoglio<i id="I-14096">&nbsp;</i>said,
     At work there are so few solo opportunities; most challenges require the
    cooperation of many people. Team members must rely on each other to follow
    through on assignments, produce quality results, share creative ideas, and
    contribute to a pleasant work environment.  Leaders who encourage cooperation
    show team members that others have very important contributions to the goals of
    the unit. Team members may also come to understand how dependent they are on
    one another in reaching mission objectives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-14097"><span id="SPAN-14098">13.7.2.
    Dr. Zoglio further states that successful teams manage differences through
    win/win negotiating and reach decisions by consensus, rather than voting.
    Successful teams have few turf wars, little competitiveness, and an ability to
    forgive and forget. Cooperation breeds shared ownership for performance
    results, and achieving objectives increases team pride and a healthy team
    spirit. Conversely, competition hinders the cooperative process, as some team
    members attempt to outshine others to gain extra attention. Such  all-starring 
    leads to in-fighting, making the team less productive.  All-starring  may also
    be evidence of a power struggle. To reduce power-play behavior, leaders should
    reemphasize each team member's specific roles and responsibilities, which
    eliminates potential barriers to cooperation.</span></p>

    <p id="P-14102"><span id="SPAN-14103">Cultivating a healthy
    team spirit requires trust, ethical behavior, critical judgment, sharing, and
    cooperation. Trust is at the heart of any healthy team interaction. Team
    members must feel comfortable with, and confident in, one another to be able to
    fully participate and share their ideas and feelings. Positive group member
    behaviors establish the climate of trust needed to develop a healthy team
    spirit. Ethical behavior requires members do what is legally, morally, and
    professionally right for one another and the organization. Such behavior is
    essential to the communication a team needs to accomplish its goals. Leaders
    must establish a healthy team spirit to drive performance and develop effective
    teams to accomplish the mission.</span></p>

    capabilities and provides an opportunity to reexamine prior decisions in light
    of evolving threats, economic conditions, and security concerns. Finally,
    planning, programming, budgeting, and execution is an iterative process
    consisting of four interrelated and overlapping phases: planning, programming,

    Planning provides the means to anticipate changes and understand the long-term
    implications of near-term choices and decisions. Streamlined planning and
    assessment documents help prioritize objectives, assess strategies, and provide
    the link between planning and programming. Within the concept of planning,

    the programming processes, the Air Force and other military department's link
    planned requirements with the resources needed to provide them. Inevitably,
    this will involve tradeoffs beyond those agreed to in the planning process. By
    programming, the Air Force matches available resources (fiscal, manpower, and
    materiel) against validated requirements to achieve the strategic plan and
    submit program proposals. Planning policies and guidance are addressed and
    initial program costs are established. The key objective of programming is to
    develop a balanced, capabilities-based Air Force program in the form of the Air
    Force program objective memorandum. In addition, through the programming
    processes, the Air Force defends the program objective memorandum during
    program review and budget review and adjusts the program as a result of the
    Office of the Secretary of Defense reviews and changing national and
    international situations.</span></p>

    <p id="P-14363"><span id="SPAN-14364">The budgeting phase of
    planning, programming, budgeting, and execution occurs concurrently with the
    programming phase. Each Department of Defense component submits a proposed
    budget estimate simultaneously with a program objective memorandum. The
    budgeting phase (formulation and justification) provides a platform for a
    detailed review of a program's pricing, phasing, and overall capability to be
    executed on time and within budget. The budgeting process principally addresses
    the years to be justified in the President's budget. Three things happen in the
    preparation of the budget estimate submission. First, Air Force budget analysts
    identify situations where the program has put Air Force resources at risk of
    Office of the Secretary of Defense or Congressional reduction. Second, the
    comptroller applies the latest inflation figures, flying hour and manpower
    rates, etc. Third, the program is put into the Office of the Secretary of
    Defense budget format and budget justification documentation is prepared. Once
    these steps are complete, the final position is called the program objective
    memorandum/budget estimate submission or program budget review. The budgeting
    phase continues with the program budget review submission and fact-of-life
    changes via notification document in the off-year. Secretary of the Air Force
    for financial management and comptroller is the Air Force lead for budget and
    budget execution.</span></p>

    <p id="P-14368"><span id="SPAN-14369">Budget execution focuses
    on running the Air Force day to day. Execution is carried out at the
    Headquarters Air Force, field operating agency, major command, primary support
    unit, wing, and unit level. The Air Force major commands (including the
    Headquarters Air Force) are allocated their share of obligation authority to
    execute their missions in accordance to approved integrated priority lists for
    those programs that are centrally managed. Because the budget being executed in
    any given year was actually compiled over a year earlier, you should logically
    assume some assumptions on which the budget was based will have changed. Because
    change is anticipated, Congress allows some flexibility within the operating
    budgets to move resources without requiring their permission but installations
    are expected to execute to the integrated priority list for centrally managed
    programs. One key part of budget execution is the major command's operations
    and maintenance operation plan. Air Force program execution is reviewed during
    major command budget execution reviews in February, April (concurrent with the
    internal Air Force midyear review), and July.</span></p>

    <p id="P-14559"><span id="SPAN-14560">The
    unit manning document, used to help manage manpower resources, is a computer
    product that lists unit funded and unfunded manpower requirements, and contains
    many data elements that identify the unique position attributes. These
    attributes include position number, Air Force specialty code, functional
    account code, office symbol code, grade, personnel accounting symbol, reason
    code, etc. The unit manning document is the primary document that reflects the
    manpower required to accomplish the unit mission. The installation manpower and
    organization office will periodically, or upon request, supply a unit with an
    updated unit manning document. Supervisors should routinely check the unit
    manning document for accuracy and use it to track their authorized manpower
    strength. Headquarters Air Force A1M and the Air Force Manpower Analysis Agency
    often produce reports based on unit manning document data; continuous review of
    coding is critical for proper position management. See Figure 13.3.</span></p>

    document displays current and projected requirements and can be configured to
    display desired fields in various formats. Unit commanders and supervisors may
    request a unit manpower document from the installation manpower and
    organization flight on an as-needed basis. Typically, the unit manpower point
    of contact serves as the liaison between the unit and manpower and organization
    flight; thus, work center supervisors should coordinate any unit manpower
    document changes, etc., with their unit manpower point of contact.</span></p>

    Requirements and the Enlisted Grades Allocation Program:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16682"><span id="SPAN-16683">13.22.2.1.
    The terms  manpower requirement  and  manpower authorization  are often
    misunderstood. A manpower requirement is a statement of manpower needed to
    accomplish a job, workload, mission, or program.&nbsp; The two types of
    manpower requirements are funded and unfunded. Funded manpower requirements are
    those that have been validated and allocated. Funded manpower requirements are
    also known as authorizations. Unfunded requirements are validated manpower
    needs that are deferred because of budgetary constraints.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16684"><span id="SPAN-16685">13.22.2.2. Some actions
    not only affect authorization levels but can also impact funded grades. The
    enlisted grades allocation program is designed to ensure enlisted grades are
    equitably allocated to Headquarters Air Force, major commands, field operating
    agencies, and direct reporting units, and at the same time not exceed
    constraints. A grade imbalance between what is required and what is funded
    (authorized) can occur as a result of legislative and budgetary constraints on
    the allocated grades. For example, Chief Master Sergeants are constrained to 1
    percent of the total enlisted force.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16686"><span id="SPAN-16687">13.22.2.3. Headquarters
    Air Force implements congressional and Department of Defense grade constraints
    by creating grade factors. Two types of factors created and distributed are:
    (1) overall command grade factors for each enlisted grade; and (2) career
    progression group factors for each Air Force specialty code to the first three
    digits. Command grade factors ensure authorized grades do not exceed
    command-ceiling constraints. The career progression group factors ensure
    equitable allocation of the grades within each Air Force specialty code in each
    command. Both types of factors are applied to the budgeted end-strength. Air Force
    career field managers can recommend adjustments to Head Quarters Air Force A1M,
    Directorate of Manpower, Organization and Resources. When making adjustments,
    they must maintain a zero balance of total grades allocated for each command.
    Commands may engage in grade swaps, via the Air Force career field manager,
    which in-turn may impact the respective factors. The factors themselves cannot
    be swapped.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16688"><b id="B-16689"><span id="SPAN-16690">13.23. Initiating and Tracking Manpower Changes:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-16691"><span id="SPAN-16692">13.23.1.
    Periodically, a unit may need to change an existing requirement on the unit
    manning document. An authorization change request (may also be referred to as
     manpower change request ) is used to request this change. The unit point of
    contact identifies the requested change and provides detailed justification to
    the servicing manpower, organization and resources flight. The manpower and
    organization section evaluates the request, enters it into the manpower
    programming and execution system, and makes a recommendation for approval or
    disapproval to the major command.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16693"><span id="SPAN-16694">13.23.2. Many actions
    necessitate an authorization change request. Some of the most frequent are Air
    Force specialty code changes, position realignments, redistribution of funding
    from a funded requirement to an unfunded requirement, and grade conversions.
    Many factors must be considered when a unit proposes a change. Common
    considerations include: (1) determining how the change affects the
    organizational structure; (2) ensuring the manpower realignment does not exceed
    the requirements allowed by Air Force manpower standards; (3) ensuring the
    requested change complies with current programming guidelines; and (4) ensuring
    the requested change does not adversely impact the unit's ability to deploy or
    perform its wartime mission.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16695"><span id="SPAN-16696">13.23.3.
    Changes to the unit manning document must be processed within resource
    constraints (i.e. no net increase in resources) minus no net increase in
    resources, grades, etc. For example, if a unit wants to fund a position that is
    currently unfunded, a funded position must be identified for conversion to
    unfund and detailed rationale for the change provided. The servicing manpower
    and organization flight will work closely with the unit point of contact when
    developing an authorization change request. Unit commander approval of
    authorization change request actions is required prior to submission of the
    authorization change request to the major command point of contact with the
    exception of actions resulting from a public-private competition or in-sourcing
    initiative.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16697"><span id="SPAN-16698">13.23.4.
    Approved changes to the unit manning document are reflected by an authorization
    change notice generated by the manpower programming and execution system. The
    authorization change notice provides details of the approved change and the
    rationale for the change. The manpower and organization flight will, in turn,
    provide a copy of the authorization change notice to the affected unit's point
    of contact. If the request is disapproved, the major command provides rationale
    to the submitting unit through the servicing manpower and organization flight.</span></p>

    Governmental Function.</b>&nbsp;The Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of
    1998 defines an inherently governmental function as one that is so intimately
    related to the public interest as to require performance by federal government
    employees. Functions may include the determination of budget policy, guidance,
    and strategy; the determination of the content and application of policies and
    regulations; the selection of individuals for federal government employment;
    and obligating money on behalf of the government. For example, warranted
    contracting officers are inherently governmental because they are responsible
    for making decisions on behalf of the government. They are the signature
    authority for committing government funds. The entire contracting staff,
    however; does not necessarily satisfy the same criteria. Contracting personnel
    who research and provide information, advice, etc., to the warranted
    contracting officers do not necessarily have to be government personnel.</span></p>

    <p id="P-16741"><span id="SPAN-16742">13.26.1.1.
    A competitive sourcing study is a public-private competition that compares the
    total cost of the in-house government operation of an activity to the total
    cost of private sector performance of the same activity. The study results
    determine whether a commercial activity can be done more economically and efficiently
    by contract or by an in-house workforce.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16743"><span id="SPAN-16744">13.26.1.2.
    During the competitive sourcing study, the in-house government operation is
    reengineered into a most efficient organization and submitted in the
    competition as the agency's tender which is the government's proposal for how
    it will perform the work. The process of developing a most efficient
    organization emphasizes innovation in meeting the requirements laid out in the
    solicitation for the work being completed. The most efficient organization is allowed
    latitude in its organization and processes outside of the standard Air Force
    structure to enable greater efficiency and effectiveness.</span></p>

    Air Force policy is to minimize both the adverse effects on personnel and the
    disruption to the affected organizations. Adversely affected personnel are
    provided the right of first refusal for contractor jobs, for which they are
    qualified, in the event the government is unable to place them in other federal
    positions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16750"><span id="SPAN-16751">13.26.2.2. Competitive
    sourcing generates savings by finding more efficient ways to accomplish a
    particular function. A competitive sourcing study also frees up military
    personnel to perform other core military essential activities. In a competitive
    sourcing study, the mission remains essentially unchanged; the composition of
    the workforce is what changes. Where blue suiters were initially performing the
    mission, the resulting service provider will be made up of either civil
    servants or private sector contract employees.</span></p>

    In-sourcing is the conversion of a contracted function to Department of Defense

    components to convert contracts without applying the Circular's requirements.

    such, the base civil engineer serves as the focal point for all construction,
    sustainment, restoration, and modernization of facilities identified as real
    property and associated real property installed equipment.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16893"><span id="SPAN-16894">13.34.2. The base civil
    engineer's customer service unit typically manages the installation's facility
    manager program. They provide initial and recurring training for facility

    <p id="P-16897"><span id="SPAN-16898">13.34.4.
    In-house work will either be direct scheduled or planned. Direct scheduled work
    does not need detailed planning and can be sent directly to the required shop
    for execution. An example of a direct scheduled work is fixing a leaky faucet.
    Planned work is typically more complex and requires detailed planning,
    scheduling of multiple shops, and lead time for material acquisition. An
    example of planned work is relocating a doorway and associated exit signs to
    accommodate the new layout. In-house work is prioritized for execution based on
    impact to the overall mission and as labor, materials, and funding become
    available.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16899"><span id="SPAN-16900">13.34.5. When work

    to the identification of facility work to satisfy current and future mission
    requirements. The base civil engineer uses several methods to identify facility
    requirements including annual space utilization surveys, biennial commander s
    facility assessments, environmental compliance status assessments, asset
    management plans, and user- or occupant-identified requirements.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-16908"><span id="SPAN-16909">13.35.2. During
    programming, the authority and resources necessary to accomplish the planned
    work are acquired. After the requirements are identified, the base civil
    engineer develops facility project proposals and presents them to the
    installation commander for validation, prioritization, and approval by the
    proper authority. A key element of programming facility requirements is proper
    work classification. Work authorization, approval levels, and fund sources vary
    with work classification. Real property maintenance work is classified as
    maintenance, repair, or construction. Operations and maintenance
    appropriation-funded unspecified minor military construction projects may not
    exceed $1,000,000. The threshold for using operation and maintenance funding
    for laboratory revitalization unspecified minor military construction projects
    is $4,000,000.</span></p>

    Your success as a military leader depends on your ability to think critically
    and creatively; it is also crucial to communicate your intentions and decisions
    to others. The ability to communicate clearly to write, speak, and actively
    listen greatly impacts your capacity to inform, teach, motivate, mentor, and
    lead those around you. Communicating your intent and ideas so that others
    understand your message and act on it is one of the primary qualities of
    leadership.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17014"><span id="SPAN-17015">14.1.2. Communication is
    the process of sharing ideas, information, and messages with others. In the Air
    Force, most communication involves speaking and writing. Any communication can
    be broken into three parts: the sender, the message, and the audience. For
    communication to be successful, the audience must not only receive the message,
    but the audience must interpret the message in the way the sender intended.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17016"><span id="SPAN-17017">14.1.3.
    This chapter begins by examining the fundamentals of better communication, both
    written and spoken. Then the chapter focuses on written communications in
    general terms and outlines certain methods that can be used to improve writing
    style. Finally, it provides an overview and samples of the types of correspondence
    the noncommissioned officer (NCO) is likely to deal with in daily activities.

    <p id="P-17142"><span id="SPAN-17143">The first hallmark of
    good communication is that the communication is focused. The sender has a clear
    idea of the purpose and objective, locks on target, and stays on track.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17144"><span id="SPAN-17145">14.2.2.<b id="B-17146">&nbsp;Organized.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17147"><span id="SPAN-17148">Good organization means
    your material is presented in a logical, systematic manner. When writing or
    speaking is not well organized, audiences become easily confused or impatient
    and may stop reading or listening. Even if you are providing useful, relevant
    information, your audience may underestimate the value of the information and
    your credibility.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17149"><span id="SPAN-17150">14.2.3.<b id="B-17151">&nbsp;Clear.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17152"><span id="SPAN-17153">This principle covers
    two interrelated ideas. First, to communicate clearly, we need to understand
    the rules of language; how to spell and pronounce words, and how to assemble
    and punctuate sentences. Second, we should get to the point, not hide our ideas
    in a maze of words.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17154"><span id="SPAN-17155">14.2.4.<b id="B-17156">&nbsp;Understanding.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17157"><span id="SPAN-17158">Understanding their
    current knowledge, views, and level of interest in the topic helps when sharing
    ideas with others. Understanding what is&nbsp;expected with the format and
    length of response, due date, level of formality, and any staffing requirements
    helps when you have been asked to write a report.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17159"><span id="SPAN-17160">14.2.5.<b id="B-17161">&nbsp;Supported.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17162"><span id="SPAN-17163">Use logic and support to
    make your point. Support and logic are the tools used to build credibility and
    trust with your audience. Nothing cripples a clearly written, properly
    punctuated paper quicker than a fractured fact or a distorted argument.</span></p>

    many things, good communication requires preparation. There are seven steps
    that will help every Airman become a better communicator, both in written
    correspondence and in speaking abilities (Figure 14.2). The first four steps
    lay the groundwork for the drafting process.</span></p>

    inadvertently exclude members of our audience by falling into communication
    traps involving references to race, religion, ethnicity, or sex. Remember this
    concept when designing your visual support. Knowing your audience and adhering
    to good taste and sensitivity will keep you in check.</span></p>

    is not just what you say, but how you say it<b id="B-17335">.&nbsp;</b>Closely tied to the
    purpose of your communication is the tone you take with your audience. Speakers
    have gestures, voice, and movements to help them communicate. Writers only have
    words on paper. How many times have you seen colleagues get bent out of shape
    over a misunderstood e-mail? Why? Because the nonverbal signals available
    during face-to-face communication are absent. Recognize this disadvantage in
    written communication and pay close attention to the tone.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17336"><span id="SPAN-17337">14.4.6.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-17338">Courtesy.</b>&nbsp;The
    first rule of writing is to be polite. Forego anger, criticism, and
    sarcasm strive to be reasonable and persuasive. Try not to deliberately
    embarrass someone and avoid with a more tactful choice of words.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17339"><span id="SPAN-17340">14.4.6.6.&nbsp;<b id="B-17341">Make
    it Personal.</b>&nbsp;When appropriate, use pronouns to create instant rapport,
    show concern, and keep your reader involved. Using pronouns also keeps your
    writing from being monotonous, dry, and abstract. The pronouns you will
    probably use the most are you, yours, we, us, and our. Use I, me, and my
    sparingly. One rule of business writing is to put your audience first; so, when
    possible, avoid using I<i id="I-17342">&nbsp;</i>as the first word of an opening sentence
    and avoid starting two sentences in a row with we or I unless you are trying to
    hammer home a point.</span></p>

    be, or not to be ) versus Informal ( hey dude ). Different communication
    situations require different levels of formality. The informal tone is more
    like a conversation between you and your reader and is characterized by clear,
    direct, active language. In today's Air Force, most of your writing will be
    informal, though ceremonies and awards may require more elaborate (formal)
    language. Whether your tone is formal or informal, you still need to follow the
    accepted rules of grammar.</span></p>

    due, acknowledge acceptance before&nbsp;focusing on
    additional improvements, and express criticism in the form of helpful
    questions, suggestions, requests, recommendations, or clear directives rather
    than accusations. Your audience always appreciates sincerity and honesty.</span></p>

    <p id="P-17353"><span id="SPAN-17354">Whether
    your goal is to persuade or inform, you will need more than fancy words to win
    the day you will need substance as well as style. Once you re clear on your
    purpose and audience (Step 1), you will need to research your topic to uncover
    information that will support your communication goals. Before you begin the
    research, refer to the five approaches to researching below for the best method
    for accomplishing researching.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17355"><span id="SPAN-17356">14.5.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-17357">Approach
    1</b>. Review purpose and scope of the overall project. Sometimes your purpose
    and scope will evolve as you learn more about the topic, and you may need to do
    some preliminary research just to get smart enough to scope out the effort.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17358"><span id="SPAN-17359">14.5.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-17360">Approach
    2.&nbsp;</b>Assign a deadline as you can easily get lost in the research
    process. Don t do an outstanding job of data retrieval, then a marginal job on
    the presentation because you ran out of time.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17361"><span id="SPAN-17362">14.5.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-17363">Approach
    3.&nbsp;</b>Ask the boss. Even if you can eventually find the answer on your
    own, save some time by asking your supervisor for suggestions on where to
    start.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17364"><span id="SPAN-17365">14.5.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-17366">Approach
    4.&nbsp;</b>Determine what is known. Before you look for answers outside
    yourself, look in the mirror. You may already have valuable knowledge about an
    assigned research project. When relying on personal knowledge, be sure to
    identify and guard against any biases you may have.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17367"><span id="SPAN-17368">14.5.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-17369">Approach
    5.&nbsp;</b>Determine where to look for information. Coworkers and base
    personnel are easy because you can meet with them face-to-face. Office files
    and references in paper form and on your computer network may be valuable
    sources of information. Finally, the internet and library offer an unlimited
    supply of information.</span></p>

    <p id="P-17374"><span id="SPAN-17375">Once
    you have researched your topic and collected information, you need to figure
    out how to use what you have found to meet your communication goals. Individual
    pieces of evidence are used to build your argument. When identifying some
    common types of evidence, they may include:</span></p>

    testimony<b id="B-17383"><i id="I-17384">&nbsp;</i></b>uses the comments of recognized authorities to
    support your claim. These comments are sometimes direct quotations or
    paraphrases, but direct quotations tend to carry more weight with listeners or
    readers.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17385"><span id="SPAN-17386">14.6.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-17387">Statistics.&nbsp;</b>The
    use of statistics<b id="B-17388">&nbsp;</b>provides a summary of data that allows your
    audience to better interpret quantitative information. Statistics can be very
    persuasive and provide excellent support if handled competently. Keep them
    simple and easy to read and understand. Also, remember to round off your
    statistics whenever possible and document the exact source of your statistics.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17389"><span id="SPAN-17390">14.6.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-17391">Example</b>.

    <p id="P-17393"><span id="SPAN-17394">14.6.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-17395">Fact.</b>&nbsp;A
    fact is a noncontroversial piece of data that can be confirmed by observation

    <p id="P-17460"><span id="SPAN-17461">A draft is not the
    finished product, and each sentence does not have to be polished and perfect.
    The focus is to get your ideas down on paper. Do not obsess about grammar,
    punctuation, spelling, and word choice this all comes later. You do not have to
    fix every mistake you see. By periodically checking your outline, you are less
    likely to lose focus and include irrelevant information. Break up your draft

    <p id="P-17462"><span id="SPAN-17463">14.8.1.<b id="B-17464">&nbsp;Introduction.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17465"><span id="SPAN-17466">The
    introduction captures your audience's attention, establishes rapport, and
    announces your purpose. Therefore, the introduction sets the stage and tone for
    your message and the direction you plan to take the audience. A typical
    introduction has three components: stage-setting remarks, a purpose statement,
    and an overview.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17467"><span id="SPAN-17468">14.8.1.1. Stage-setting
    remarks sets the tone, captures the audience's attentions, and encourages the

    <p id="P-17469"><span id="SPAN-17470">14.8.1.2. The purpose

    <p id="P-17476"><span id="SPAN-17477">This
    is the heart of your message and includes the main ideas about your subject and
    supporting details under each main idea. The body, depending on the purpose and
    subject, will typically consist of several paragraphs. As a general rule a
    separate paragraph is formed for each main idea.</span></p>

    <p id="P-17481"><span id="SPAN-17482">The
    conclusion is the last and often neglected part of well-arranged communication.
    An effective conclusion often summarizes the main points discussed in the body,
    and leaves the reader with a sense of closure. Conclude your communication with
    positive statements based on your preceding discussion and avoid bringing up
    new information. The introduction and conclusion should balance each other
    without being identical.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17483"><span id="SPAN-17484">14.8.4.<b id="B-17485">&nbsp;Effective Paragraphs:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17486"><span id="SPAN-17487">14.8.4.1.
    Paragraphs are the primary vehicles for developing ideas. They group related
    ideas into single units of thought, separate one unit of thought from another,
    and alert readers that the writer is shifting to another phase of the subject.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17488"><span id="SPAN-17489">14.8.4.2.
    Each paragraph contains a topic sentence, preferably at the beginning, that
    prepares the reader for the rest of the paragraph and provides a point of focus
    for support details, facts, figures, and examples. Use supporting ideas to
    prove, clarify, illustrate, and develop your main point. The objective is to
    help the readers see the paragraphs as integrated units rather than a mere
    collection of sentences.</span></p>

    <p id="P-17493"><span id="SPAN-17494">Prepare
    all Air Force correspondence using plain language. Plain language means using
    logical organization; common, everyday words (except for necessary technical

    <p id="P-17495"><span id="SPAN-17496">14.8.6.<b id="B-17497">&nbsp;Transitions.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17498"><span id="SPAN-17499">One
    way to make sure your paragraphs flow together, both internally and externally,
    is by using transitions in the form of words, phrases, or sentences. Internal
    transitions are used within a sentence to improve the flow, while external
    transitions are used to link separate paragraphs together within the body of
    the communication.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17500"><span id="SPAN-17501">14.8.7.<b id="B-17502">&nbsp;Effective Sentences.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17503"><span id="SPAN-17504">To draft clear and
    concise sentences, choose clear and concise words and phrases to make up your
    sentences. There are three considerations to make when drafting sentences:

    way to make sure you edit efficiently is to read your document at least three
    times to allow yourself to really look hard at the problem areas that could

    pass, look at paragraph construction; and in the third pass look at sentences,

    <p id="P-17691"><span id="SPAN-17692">14.9.1.1. Ensure the

    <p id="P-17695"><span id="SPAN-17696">14.9.1.3. Compare the
    introduction and conclusion to make sure they go together without sounding
    identical. The introduction should declare the purpose, and the conclusion
    should show the readers the purpose was accomplished.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17697"><span id="SPAN-17698">14.9.1.4. When checking
    for relevance and completeness, ensure the paragraphs clearly relate to the
    purpose statement, contain all main points, and are arranged in a consistent

    Structure, and Clarity.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17702"><span id="SPAN-17703">In the second pass,
    check whether the main points and supporting ideas are appropriately organized
    in paragraphs. For each paragraph, focus on the following areas:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17704"><span id="SPAN-17705">14.9.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-17706">Unity
    of Focus.</b>&nbsp;Ensure there is only one main point of the paragraph and all

    <p id="P-17707"><span id="SPAN-17708">14.9.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-17709">Topic

    <p id="P-17710"><span id="SPAN-17711">14.9.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-17712">Supporting
    Ideas.</b>&nbsp;Ensure sentences expand, clarify, illustrate, and explain
    points mentioned or suggested in each main idea. The paragraph should have
    enough details to support the central idea without any extra sentences that are
    irrelevant to the main point. Also, ensure all transitional words, phrases, and
    clauses improve the flow and show proper relationships. Finally, the paragraph
    should contain three to seven sentences.</span></p>

    and Words.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17716"><span id="SPAN-17717">Look
    at the details and concentrate on the small stuff that can sabotage your
    communication. These details include the passive voice, unclear language,
    excessive wordiness, grammatical errors, and spelling mistakes. Read the paper
    out loud. This requires the communicator to slow down and use two senses seeing
    and hearing which increases the chances of catching errors. What one sense
    misses, the other will pick up.</span></p>

    <p id="P-17722"><span id="SPAN-17723">Fighting
    for feedback and getting approval are both activities that are part of life in
    the Air Force. Feedback and coordination are closely linked. If the
    communicator does a good job at fighting for feedback, the coordination process
    becomes much smoother. The biggest benefit to fighting for feedback is getting
    a second pair of eyes to review the communication. Even the best writers and
    speakers cannot see where the communication can be made stronger as they become
    too close to the communication. Coworkers are usually a good choice because of
    their familiarity with the issue and jargon. Also, asking a trusted agent or
    someone you consider an expert in a specific area of the communication, such as
    grammar, is another choice to obtain feedback.</span></p>

    <p id="P-17727"><span id="SPAN-17728">To give effective
    feedback, refer to the following:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17729"><span id="SPAN-17730">14.10.1.1. First,
    effective feedback is consistent, objective, and sensitive to the stated
    purpose. If asked to review a package, make sure you understand what the person
    wants from your review and stick to it.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17731"><span id="SPAN-17732">14.10.1.2. Second,
    distinguish between necessary, desirable, and unnecessary changes. A page full
    of red marks is hard to interpret. Instead, give the author a sense of what
    really needs to be changed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17733"><span id="SPAN-17734">14.10.1.3.
    Third, avoid using general statements. Instead, pinpoint specific problems such
    as awkward sentences, grammar, etc. 14.10.1.4. Fourth, concentrate on improving
    the message's content, not the style or personal preferences of the author
    (unless the author has asked you specifically to comment on writing style).
    Before providing feedback, refer to the feedback philosophies in Figure
    14.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-17735">Figure 14.4. Feedback Philosophies</b></span></p>

    separate-page MFR is based on the official memorandum but omits the  FROM: 
    since the writer is both the sender and receiver. This MFR is an in-house
    document to record information that would otherwise not be recorded in writing
    (for example, a telephone call, results of a meeting, or information passed to
    other staff members on an informal basis). People who work together every day
    generally pass most information to their coworkers verbally, but there are
    times when information should be recorded and kept on file. A memorandum for
    record is the right tool for this purpose. Figure 14.6 illustrates the format

    This memorandum for record gives the reader a quick synopsis of the purpose of

    <p id="P-17931"><span id="SPAN-17932">14.12.1.<b id="B-17933">&nbsp;Step 1: Extract the Facts.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17934"><span id="SPAN-17935">Getting
    started can be the hardest part of bullet statement writing. The key is to
    collect all of the information you can find relevant to the actual
    accomplishment. First, gather as much information as you can, then sort through
    the information collected. When sorting the information:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17936"><span id="SPAN-17937">14.12.1.1. Isolate and
    record the specific action the person performed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17938"><span id="SPAN-17939">14.12.1.2. Mark the
    action with a power verb that best describes the action (for example, repaired,
    installed, designed, etc.).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17940"><span id="SPAN-17941">14.12.1.3. Document
    related numerical information (number of items fixed, dollars saved, man-hours
    expended, people served, pages written, etc.).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17942"><span id="SPAN-17943">14.12.1.4. Document how
    this accomplishment impacted the bigger picture and broader mission of the

    <p id="P-17944"><span id="SPAN-17945">14.12.1.5. Once
    captured, review each item and test to see if the item is truly associated with

    <p id="P-17946"><span id="SPAN-17947">14.12.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-17948">Step 2: Build the Structure.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17949"><span id="SPAN-17950">The next step is to take
    the sorted information and organize the information into an
    accomplishment-impact bullet. There are two components: the accomplishment
    element and the impact element.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17951"><span id="SPAN-17952">14.12.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-17953">Accomplishment
    Element.</b>&nbsp;The accomplishment element should always begin with an action
    and only focus on one single accomplishment. Most of the time this action takes
    the form of a strong action verb such as conducted, established, or led. If you
    need to give action verbs an added boost, you can use an adverb such as
    actively, energetically, or swiftly to modify the verb. For a more complete
    list of verbs and adverbs, refer to Air Force Handbook 33-337,&nbsp;<i id="I-17954">The
    Tongue and Quill</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17955"><span id="SPAN-17956">14.12.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-17957">Impact
    Element.</b>&nbsp;The impact element part of the bullet statement explains how
    the person's actions have had an effect on the organization. The impact element
    can show varying levels of influence, such as the person's actions connected to
    significant improvements to a work center's mission, a unit's mission, or as
    broad as the entire Air Force.</span></p>

    <p id="P-17979"><span id="SPAN-17980">This section focuses on
    spoken communication both speaking and listening.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17981"><span id="SPAN-17982">14.13.1.<b id="B-17983">&nbsp;Verbal Communication.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17984"><span id="SPAN-17985">An effective voice
    drives home ideas or information. The speaker has control over such things as
    rate, volume, pitch, and pause. The techniques used to create interest and help
    increase communication include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17986"><span id="SPAN-17987">14.13.1.1.<b id="B-17988">&nbsp;Rate.</b>&nbsp;There
    is no correct rate of speed for every speech; however, consider this: the
    average processing rate is 500 words per minute and the average speaking rate
    is 180 words a minute. Speak too slowly, and the audience will lose interest;
    on the other hand, speak too fast and the speech will become unintelligible.
    The key is to vary the rate of speech to hold the audience's attention and to
    add emphasis.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17989"><span id="SPAN-17990">14.13.1.2.<b id="B-17991">&nbsp;Volume.</b>&nbsp;Another
    verbal technique that can give emphasis to a speech is volume. If possible,
    check out the room to know how loudly you must talk, remembering you will need
    to talk louder with a crowd since the sound is absorbed. Remember your voice
    will carry further when the room is empty versus full. If the audience must
    strain to hear you, they will eventually tune you out from utter exhaustion.
    Speak louder or softer to emphasize a point  a softer level or lower volume is
    often the more effective way to achieve emphasis.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17992"><span id="SPAN-17993">14.13.1.3.<b id="B-17994">&nbsp;Pitch.</b>&nbsp;The
    use of notes, higher or lower, in the voice is called pitch. Speakers use pitch
    changes in vowels, words, or entire sentences. Use a downward (high to low)
    inflection in a sentence for an air of certainty, and an upward (low to high)
    inflection for an air of uncertainty. Variety in speech pitch helps to avoid
    monotone and to capture the listener's attention.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17995"><span id="SPAN-17996">14.13.1.4.<b id="B-17997">&nbsp;Pause.</b>&nbsp;The
    pause technique gives the speaker time to catch his or her breath and the
    audience time to collect the speaker's ideas. The pause technique serves the
    same function as punctuation in writing. Short pauses usually divide points
    within a sentence and longer pauses note the ends of sentences. The speaker can
    also use longer pauses for breaks from one main point to another, from the body
    to the conclusion of the speech, or to set off an important point worthy of
    short reflection.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-17998"><span id="SPAN-17999">14.13.1.5.<b id="B-18000">&nbsp;Articulation
    and Pronunciation.</b>&nbsp;Articulation is the art of expressing words
    distinctly. Pronunciation is the ability to say words correctly. People can
    articulate their thoughts and still mispronounce words while doing so.
    Unfortunately (and unfairly), many people consider word pronunciation or
    mispronunciation a direct reflection on the speaker's intelligence. If you are
    not sure of the pronunciation, consult a current dictionary.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18001"><span id="SPAN-18002">14.13.1.6.<b id="B-18003">&nbsp;Length.</b>&nbsp;The
    length of a presentation is crucial. A key rule in verbal communication is
    short and sweet.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18004"><span id="SPAN-18005">Be prepared, know what
    you want to say, then say what you want to say with your purpose and audience
    in mind.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18006"><span id="SPAN-18007">14.13.2.<b id="B-18008">&nbsp;Nonverbal Communication.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18009"><span id="SPAN-18010">Actually
    presenting the talk is the hardest part for many people. How can body movement,
    voice, and sincerity enhance a presentation? Communications experts tell us
    that over half of our meaning may be communicated nonverbally. Although
    nonverbal meaning is communicated through vocal cues, much meaning is carried
    by the physical behaviors of eye contact, body movement, and gestures.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18011"><span id="SPAN-18012">14.13.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18013">Eye
    Contact.</b>&nbsp;This is one of the most important factors in nonverbal
    communication. Nothing will enhance the delivery more than effective eye
    contact with the audience. Eye contact is important for three reasons. First,
    lets the listeners know the speaker is interested in them. Second, effective
    eye contact allows you to receive nonverbal feedback from the audience. Third,
    effective eye contact enhances the credibility of the speaker.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18014"><span id="SPAN-18015">14.13.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18016">Body
    Movement.</b>&nbsp;Good body movement is important because body movement
    catches the eye of the listener. Effective body movement can be described as
    free and purposeful. While not essential, the speaker should feel free to move
    around in front of the audience. When looking at note cards, speakers should
    drop their eyes, not their head.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18017"><span id="SPAN-18018">14.13.2.3.<b id="B-18019">&nbsp;Gestures.</b>&nbsp;Gestures
    are the purposeful use of the hands, arms, shoulders, and head to reinforce
    what is being said. Effective gestures are both natural and purposeful.
    Fidgeting with a paperclip, rearranging or shuffling papers, and constantly
    clicking a pen are distracting to the audience.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18020"><span id="SPAN-18021">14.13.3.<b id="B-18022">&nbsp;Delivery Formats.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18023"><span id="SPAN-18024">Your approach to
    delivery of the spoken message is usually affected by several factors,
    including the time you have to prepare and the nature of the message. Three
    common delivery formats are:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18025"><span id="SPAN-18026">14.13.3.1.<b id="B-18027">&nbsp;Impromptu.</b>&nbsp;Speaking
    when we respond during a meeting or  take the floor  at a conference. Speakers
    may do this when they have to speak publicly without warning or with only a few
    moments' notice. To do impromptu speaking well requires a great amount of
    self-confidence, mastery of the subject, and the ability to  think on your
    feet.  A superb impromptu speaker has achieved the highest level in verbal
    communications.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18028"><span id="SPAN-18029">14.13.3.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18030">Prepared
    (Formally Extemporaneous).</b>&nbsp;Prepared speaking or briefing refers to
    those times when we have ample opportunity to prepare. This does not mean the
    person writes a script and memorizes the script, but prepared delivery does
    require a thorough outline with careful planning and practicing. The specific
    words and phrases used at the time of delivery, however, are spontaneous and
    sound very natural.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18031"><span id="SPAN-18032">14.13.3.3.<b id="B-18033">&nbsp;Manuscript.</b>&nbsp;A
    manuscript briefing is the delivery format that requires every word spoken to
    be absolutely perfect. The disadvantage of a manuscript briefing is that people
    demonstrate a tendency to lack spontaneity, lack eye contact, and they stand
    behind the lectern with their script.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18034"><span id="SPAN-18035">14.13.4.<b id="B-18036">&nbsp;Types of Speaking.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18037"><span id="SPAN-18038">Types of speaking used
    in the Air Force include briefing, teaching lecture, and formal speech.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18039"><span id="SPAN-18040">14.13.4.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18041">Briefing.</b>&nbsp;The
    best military briefings are concise and factual. Their major purpose is to
    inform listeners about a mission, operation, or concept. Some briefings direct
    or enable listeners to perform a procedure or carry out instructions. Other
    briefings advocate, persuade, or support a certain solution and lead the audience
    to accept the briefing. Every good briefing has the qualities of accuracy,
    brevity, and clarity. Accuracy and clarity characterize all good speaking, but
    brevity distinguishes the briefing from other types of speaking. A briefer must
    be brief and to the point and should anticipate some of the questions that may
    arise. If a briefer cannot answer a question, he or she should not attempt an

    Lecture.</b>&nbsp;The teaching lecture is the method of instruction most often
    used in the Air Force. As the name implies, the primary purpose of a teaching
    lecture is to teach students about a given subject. Teaching lectures are either
    formal or informal. Formal lectures are generally one-way with no verbal
    participation by the students. Informal lectures are usually presented to
    smaller audiences and allow for verbal interaction between the instructor and
    students.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18045"><span id="SPAN-18046">14.13.4.3.<b id="B-18047">&nbsp;Formal
    Speech.</b>&nbsp;A formal speech generally has one of three basic purposes: to
    inform, persuade, or entertain. The informative speech is a narration
    concerning a specific topic but does not involve a sustained effort to teach.
    Orientation talks and presentations at commander's call are examples of
    informative speeches. The persuasive speech is designed to move an audience to
    believe in or take action on the topic presented. Recruiting speeches to high
    school graduating classes and court-martial summations are speeches primarily
    developed to persuade. The entertaining speech gives enjoyment to the audience.
    The speaker often relies on humor and vivid language to entertain listeners. A
    speech to entertain is appropriate at a Dining-Out.</span></p>

    Process.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18054"><span id="SPAN-18055">To
    better understand the listening process, let's begin by distinguishing between
    hearing and listening. Hearing occurs when your ears pick up sound waves being
    transmitted by a speaker or some other source. Hearing requires a source of
    sound and an ear capable of perceiving sound. Hearing does not require the
    conscious decoding of information.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18056"><span id="SPAN-18057">14.14.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18058">Listening To Make Sense.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18059"><span id="SPAN-18060">Listening,
    on the other hand, involves making sense out of what is being transmitted.
    Listening involves not only hearing, it involves attending to and considering
    what is heard. Effective listening is an active process. Active listening
    involves exerting energy and responding appropriately in order to hear,
    comprehend, evaluate, and remember the message.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18061"><span id="SPAN-18062">14.14.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-18063">The Importance of Listening.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18064"><span id="SPAN-18065">Listening
    is especially important in the Air Force, and actually in any military unit.
    Success is literally a matter of life and death, and we routinely
    maintain/operate equipment worth millions of dollars. Receiving, comprehending,
    and remembering spoken information is critical. Any miscommunication is
    potentially catastrophic. Effective listening helps to build the trust and
    mutual respect needed to do our jobs. Military personnel must understand their
    team members and the situation. Leaders with good listening skills often make
    better decisions and have a stronger bond with their Airmen.</span></p>

    <p id="P-18319"><b id="B-18320"><span id="SPAN-18321">14.23. Introduction.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-18322"><span id="SPAN-18323">Many
    Air Force positions require a job interview. Knowing how to prepare for and
    conduct yourself during this process can go a long way toward helping you get
    that special duty or some other much-coveted job in the Air Force. This section
    is designed to help you prepare for and succeed in conducting an effective Air
    Force interview:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18324"><span id="SPAN-18325">14.23.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18326">Purpose of Interviews.</b>&nbsp;So, you ve found
    a new job in the Air Force one that requires special talents and experience;
    one that requires you to gather letters of recommendation, submit a resume, and
    provide copies of your last five enlisted performance reports (EPR);&nbsp;<b id="B-18327"><i id="I-18328">and</i></b>&nbsp;one
    that requires you to sit through a job interview. If you ve ever completed a
    special duty assignment or worked at certain headquarters assignments, chances
    are you ve already sat through a job interview. However, for many Airmen out
    there, the Air Force job interview is a new experience one requiring
    preparation, practice, and perseverance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18329"><span id="SPAN-18330">14.23.1.1.
    Before you set off for that interview, there are a few things you will need to
    understand about the interview process. First, you need to understand the
    purpose of the job interview. All job interviews are designed with one goal in
    mind: to find the right person for a particular job. As military members, many
    of you will sit through job interviews to get that special job or position
    you ve been looking for. Understanding that employers may have to interview
    several member for the position, should give you some respect for the process
    and help you understand that your goal in an interview is to convince the
    interviewer that&nbsp;<b id="B-18331"><i id="I-18332">you</i></b>&nbsp;are the right person for the job.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18333"><span id="SPAN-18334">14.23.1.2. The second thing you should know
    about interviews is that they are a two-way process. You are not only
    interviewing for a job; you are interviewing the prospective employer to see if
    you actually want the job. Are you willing to spend the next 2-3 years of your
    career in this organization? Are you willing to work under the conditions laid
    out in the job description? Are you willing to make a permanent change of
    station for the position? There are a host of other concerns you should have in
    mind when preparing for the interview, many of which should center on your
    desire for the job and working in the new organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18335"><span id="SPAN-18336">14.23.1.3.
    Third, you need to understand that interviews are information-sharing events
    between you and the interviewer. Your job is to convince the interviewer that
    your unique knowledge, skills, and abilities are a perfect match for the
    position you re seeking. Conversely, the interviewer's job is to sift through
    reams of information gathered from numerous interviews and eventually match
    the&nbsp;<b id="B-18337"><i id="I-18338">right</i></b>&nbsp;person to the position. The interviewer is
    basically asking each interviewee the same question:  Why should I hire&nbsp;<b id="B-18339"><i id="I-18340">you</i></b>? 
    while all interviewees are also highlighting their particular skills for the
    job.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18341"><span id="SPAN-18342">14.23.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18343">Types of Interviews.</b>&nbsp;As
    you ve just read, the purpose of the interview is to find the best person for
    the job. However, interviews can be conducted in several different ways.
    14.23.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18344">Face-to-face Interviews:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18345"><span id="SPAN-18346">14.23.2.1.1.
    Face-to-face interviews usually take place in one of two formats: the
    individual interview or the panel interview. The individual interview may be
    the person who will supervise you or someone higher in the chain of command.
    Hiring decisions are often made based on this type of interview. Count on
    discussing your skills, experience, and training, and how they all relate to
    the job.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18347"><span id="SPAN-18348">14.23.2.1.2.
    A selection panel or board interview is frequently used when organizations are
    filling a managerial position. Usually, three or more people sit on the board,
    and all candidates are asked the same questions. A selection board interview
    usually involves more structured questions than an individual interview. This
    interview can be stressful because you have to answer questions from several
    people. Be sure to make eye contact with everyone on the panel. When answering
    a question, you should make eye contact with the person asking the question.</span></p>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <p id="P-18349"><span id="SPAN-18350">14.23.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18351">Phone Interviews:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18352"><span id="SPAN-18353">14.23.2.2.1.
    The phone interview is another strategy organizations use to select highly
    qualified Airmen. In this situation, the hiring organization interviews
    applicants over the phone. These interviews are sometimes used to make
    first-round cuts to the applicant pool.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18354"><span id="SPAN-18355">14.23.2.2.2.
    If you apply for a special assignment, chances are the location will be away
    from your current assignment. In this case, the hiring organization usually
    conducts the entire interview over the phone. In these situations, there are no
    second chances to make a good impression, and decisions are based strictly on
    the phone interview.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18356"><span id="SPAN-18357">14.23.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-18358">Interviewing:&nbsp;</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18359"><span id="SPAN-18360">14.23.3.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18361">Pre-interview Preparations:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18362"><span id="SPAN-18363">14.23.3.1.1.
    One of the first things you need to do to prepare for any Air Force job
    interview is to carefully study the job advertisement or position description.
    This provides you with information on the particular knowledge, skills, and
    abilities for which the hiring organization is looking. What experience or
    skills are required for the job? Do you have the required experience or skills?
    Note the key responsibilities of the job and try to match your knowledge,
    skills, and abilities to those requirements and you should make the connections
    now because you will be asked to do the very same thing during the interview.
    This first step helps you understand how your talents measure up to the
    requirements for the position you re seeking.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18364"><span id="SPAN-18365">14.23.3.1.2.
    The next step is to gather all required information and documentation for the
    application process. In many cases, you will need to submit past EPRs, a
    personnel report on individual personnel, a resume, letters of recommendation,
    and a cover letter. A targeted resume and letters of recommendation should
    highlight your particular knowledge, skills, and abilities, and relate them to
    the position for which you re applying. A cover letter should target one or two
    strengths not mentioned in your EPRs, resume, or letters of recommendation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18366"><span id="SPAN-18367">14.23.3.1.3.
    One important aspect to consider before the interview is to conduct research on
    the mission and history of the hiring organization before the interview. Who
    are the commander and senior enlisted members of the organization? How large is
    the organization? What are the mission and vision statements? If you know
    someone who works in the organization, you should call him or her and ask some
    particular questions about the organization. Are there any mission changes in
    the foreseeable future? How many enlisted personnel are assigned there? Has the
    organization done anything noteworthy in the past 2 or 3 years? The more you
    know about the organization, the better job you will do of convincing potential
    employers that you care about the organization, as well as the job you re
    seeking.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18368"><span id="SPAN-18369">14.23.3.1.4.
    When preparing for any interview, think about and write down your strengths and
    weaknesses. Identify two or three strengths that target the knowledge, skills,
    and abilities in the job advertisement. Next, identify one or two weaknesses
    that can be turned into strengths (for example, I m detail oriented but not a
    micromanager). Putting your strengths and weakness on paper allows you to study
    and become intimately familiar with them and builds your confidence as you
    prepare for the interview. As you write down your strengths and weaknesses,
    develop specific examples that highlight your skills. You will be asked to
    provide examples of your experience during the interview. Developing
    examples&nbsp;<b id="B-18370"><i id="I-18371">before</i></b>&nbsp;the interview can only help make the
    interview flow more smoothly.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18372"><span id="SPAN-18373">14.23.3.1.5.
    Use job descriptions and bullets from past EPRs to develop possible questions
    employers might ask during the interview. Remember, employers know exactly what
    they are looking for, and they are using the interview process to find the
    right person to fill the position. Put yourself in the interviewer's shoes and
    develop a set of questions you would ask if you were them. Then, develop
    answers to the questions you just came up with. If your EPRs were sent as part
    of the application package, you can bet some of the questions will be targeted
    toward specific achievements highlighted. Include specific, concrete examples
    that not only highlight your skills but also tie directly to the specific
    requirements of the job. Some examples of areas to concentrate on are: (1)
    problem-solving skills; (2) thoughts on Air Force transformation; (3)
    team-building skills; (4) how you support the Chief of Staff of the Air Force
    priorities; (5) leadership philosophy; (6) ability to adapt and work in
    fast-paced environments; (7) handling criticism; and (8) decision making
    ability.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18374"><span id="SPAN-18375">14.23.3.1.6.
    Also, be able to answer the following questions: Why should I hire&nbsp;<b id="B-18376"><i id="I-18377">you</i></b>?
    How soon can you report? If applicable, how does your family feel about the
    move? Where do you see yourself in 2 to 3 years? Are there any personal issues
    that may prevent you from accepting or performing in this position?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18378"><span id="SPAN-18379">14.23.3.1.7.
    Develop a list of questions to ask potential employers. Interviewers expect
    candidates to ask intelligent, thoughtful questions concerning the organization
    and the nature of the work. The nature and quality of your questions reveals
    your interest in the organization and the position you re seeking. Ensure your
    questions are employer-centered; avoid self-centered questions that might
    indicate you are primarily interested in knowing about the benefits of the
    position. Potential questions should center on (1) duties and responsibilities
    of the job; (2) possible mission changes in the organization; (3) chain of
    command or lines of responsibility; (4) unique requirements of the
    organization; and (5) a typical day in the organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18380"><span id="SPAN-18381">14.23.3.1.8. Finally, you need to practice,
    practice, practice. Practice how you will get out of your car. Practice how you
    will walk into the room. Practice how you will answer questions. Practice how
    you will ask questions. Practice your nonverbals. Practice anything you think
    you will do before, during, or after the interview. This will make you more
    comfortable and confident and will help you perform better during the
    interview. If possible, have friends and family conduct mock interviews.
    Practice in front of a mirror if mock interviews are impossible or impractical.
    The bottom line here is practice, practice, practice!</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18382"><span id="SPAN-18383">14.23.3.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18384">Listening
    Skills.</b>&nbsp;Listening during the interview is as essential to your success
    as talking openly and honestly about knowledge, skills, and abilities.
    Concentrate on what is being said and how it is said, rather than how you are
    doing. By listening to the interviewer's statements, comments, and questions,
    you gain a better understanding of the organization and what workplace would be
    like to work there. If you pay close attention, you can probably hear the
     questions behind the questions' your interviewer asks. In other words, pay
    close attention and read between the lines for what is&nbsp;<b id="B-18385"><i id="I-18386">not</i>&nbsp;</b>being
    said in the interview, and you can probably pick up useful nuggets of
    information that can benefit you during the interview. For instance, if the
    interviewer continually asks about your ability to develop and motivate teams
    or seems to refer to getting teams to work better, you may pick up a possible
    team-development issue within the organization. With this information, you can
    sell your ability to lead and motivate teams and possibly land yourself the
    job.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18387"><span id="SPAN-18388">14.23.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-18389">The Actual Interview.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18390"><span id="SPAN-18391">As
    mentioned earlier, most will be interviewed in one of two ways: by phone or in
    person. If conducted by phone, the interview begins the moment you pick up the
    phone and ends once you hang up. On the other hand, personal interviews begin
    the moment you get out of your car and end when you drive out of the parking
    lot. Either way, the interview is the one best chance you have of  selling
    yourself  to any potential employer. Whether you interview by phone or in
    person, there are certain rules you should keep in mind: (1) keep your answers
    concise; limited to about 2-3 minutes; (2) provide specific examples of your skills
    and achievements; (3) tie your strengths to the requirements of the job; (4)
    ask questions; (5) maintain a conversational tone throughout the interview; and
    (6) keep important documents nearby (such as EPRs, resumes, letters of
    reference, etc.).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18392"><span id="SPAN-18393">14.23.4.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18394">The Phone Interview.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18395"><span id="SPAN-18396">To
    some, the phone interview may seem less important than a personal interview
    because the interview is conducted from different locations and removed from
    direct observation of the interviewer. However, in many aspects, the phone
    interview is more difficult than a personal interview. For instance, in a
    personal interview you can usually gauge how the interview is going by paying
    attention to the interviewer's nonverbals. On the other hand, with a phone
    interview there are no visual cues to tell you how you are doing. Therefore,
    there are some areas you will have to pay close attention to if you want to
    successfully navigate through a phone interview. Here are a few tips to help
    you succeed:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18397"><span id="SPAN-18398">14.23.4.1.1.
    Smile during the interview, just as you would in a personal interview. While
    hiding behind a phone allows you to disguise your body language, there is no
    way you can disguise your vocal cues due to nonverbals. Smiling during a phone
    interview keeps you energetic and helps project enthusiasm.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18399"><span id="SPAN-18400">14.23.4.1.2.
    Keep a mirror in front of you during the interview. This allows you to see your
    own expressions and will help to ensure you are smiling and paying attention to
    your body language. Just because the interviewer can t see you doesn t mean he
    or she is not listening for details of your nonverbal responses during the
    interview. A mirror also ensures you conduct yourself in much the same way you
    would in a personal interview. You would not put your feet on a desk during a
    personal interview, would you? Of course not! So keep your feet off your desk
    during a phone interview. Believe it or not, your body posture naturally
    reflects in your voice. If your posture is slacking while you are on the phone,
    you can bet your vocal tone will convey that. Keeping a mirror in front of you
    will help you focus on your body language and nonverbal responses.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18401"><span id="SPAN-18402">14.23.4.1.3.
    Know when to speak, and then when to stop. In a personal interview, you can
    usually tell from the interviewer's nonverbals when you need to wrap up an
    answer or move on. Phone interviews are often filled with long, silent pauses.
    Do not feel that you need to fill that dead space with conversation. Pay close
    attention to the tone of the interviewer's voice and know when to stop talking
    and move on.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18403"><span id="SPAN-18404">14.23.4.1.4. Develop
    notes for telephone interviews. These notes should include a list of your
    strengths and weaknesses and how your skills match organizational needs.
    Develop a list of potential questions employers might ask, along with possible
    responses. Practice delivering responses so that you will be ready to give
    polished answers in a clear confident tone. Do not memorize canned answers
    since they are likely to sound canned over the phone. Instead, use the script
    to trigger appropriate responses that sound both spontaneous and energetic. Do
    not forget to ask questions. Questions for potential employers should be part

    in mind, the real key to success in any interview is practice.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18405"><span id="SPAN-18406">14.23.4.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18407">The Personal Interview:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18408"><span id="SPAN-18409">14.23.4.2.1.
    In many cases, personal interviews begin the moment you get out of your car and
    do not end until you drive away. Many prospective employers will observe you as
    you walk from your car to the front door of the building or office. Others will
    purposely let you sit in a waiting area for 10 to 20 minutes. All of this is
    designed to create tension and provide the employer an opportunity to observe
    your bearing before the actual interview begins. We cannot overstate that you
    are on the interviewing clock even though you are not sitting in an
    interviewing room.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18410"><span id="SPAN-18411">14.23.4.2.2.
    In job interviews, potential employers judge you on how you look and act, not
    just on what you say. Your actions, mannerisms, and appearance are reflected in
    your body language. They give nonverbal information about your work-related
    skills, attitudes, and values. Research shows that 65 percent of meaning in any
    interaction is conveyed nonverbally. In many interviews, nonverbal cues are just
    as important as verbal information in determining who is hired. After all, each
    person the organization interviews is probably qualified for the job.
    Therefore, you want to appear&nbsp;<b id="B-18412"><i id="I-18413">more</i></b>&nbsp;qualified than
    anyone else do not let your nonverbals cost you a job.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18414"><span id="SPAN-18415">14.23.4.2.3.
    The first thing required for the interview is to ensure you are wearing the
    proper uniform. You should get this information before the interview, but check
    before the interview to make sure. Your dress and appearance is the first
    nonverbal message you send to any employer, so ensure you are squared away and
    nothing is out of place.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18416"><span id="SPAN-18417">14.23.4.2.4.
    Offer a firm (but not&nbsp;<b id="B-18418"><i id="I-18419">too</i></b>&nbsp;firm), warm, whole-hand
    handshake. Shake hands with both men and women the same way. You would not give
    men and women different salutes, so do not offer them different handshakes.
    Practice your handshake before the interview.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18420"><span id="SPAN-18421">14.23.4.2.5.
    Make eye contact with the interviewers. Your eyes are your most powerful
    communication tools, and many interviewers use eye contact to determine
    enthusiasm, sincerity, and possible inconsistencies in your responses. If you
    use natural eye contact, the interview will become more like a conversation
    between acquaintances and you will get over some of your nervousness.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18422"><span id="SPAN-18423">14.23.4.2.6.
    Sit up straight, but not stiff, and lean slightly forward toward the
    interviewer. As the interview progresses, you may want to mirror the body
    language of the interviewer. If the interviewer takes a more relaxed posture,
    then you should relax too but not too much. If the interviewer is more formal,
    then you need to mirror that formal behavior.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18424"><span id="SPAN-18425">14.23.4.2.7.
    Use natural gestures. If you normally use your hands to gesture as you talk, do
    so during the interview. Gestures help you relax, convey enthusiasm, and
    release nervous energy. Be careful, though, to avoid nervous gestures such as
    drumming your fingers, playing with a pencil, jingling the change in your
    pocket, tapping your feet, etc.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18426"><span id="SPAN-18427">14.23.4.2.8. Speak
    clearly and evenly not too fast, but not too slow. Expression is a powerful way
    to show enthusiasm. Do not speak in a monotone voice. Allow your volume to rise
    and fall, and pronounce words clearly. Use good grammar and diction, and always
    think before you speak. The interviewer will assess your communication skills
    based on how clearly you express yourself.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18428"><span id="SPAN-18429">14.23.4.2.9.
    Notice the nonverbal cues of the interviewer. His or her facial expressions
    will let you know how well he or she is listening and may give you clues as to
    how you are doing. For instance, if the interviewer seems distracted or
    inattentive, you will need to shorten your answers, use examples, or ask
    questions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18430"><span id="SPAN-18431">14.23.4.2.10.
    As the interview ends, take 2 to 3 minutes to summarize. This gives you a
    chance to end the interview on a positive note, convey your interest in the
    position, and sell yourself one more time. During the summary, recap one or two
    of the key points of the interview and restate how your experience and skills
    match those required for the position.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18432"><b id="B-18433"><span id="SPAN-18434">14.24. Post-interview Actions:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-18435"><span id="SPAN-18436">14.24.1. Once the
    interview is complete, two things will increase your chances of success and
    help you learn from your experience. First, send a short (two or three
    paragraphs) thank-you note to the organization with which you interviewed. The
    letter should be typed or handwritten and should express your gratitude for the
    interview opportunity. Restate your interest in the position and highlight any
    particularly noteworthy points made in your conversation or anything you wish
    to further clarify. This is also an opportunity to add anything you forgot or
    wish you had said in the interview. Close the letter by mentioning that you
    will call in a few days to inquire about the employer's decision. Always mail
    the letter within a day or two of the interview.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18437"><span id="SPAN-18438">14.24.2. The second thing
    is to make a few notes about the interview. Record some of the questions asked
    and how you answered them. Write down your strong and weak points from the
    interview. Make a list of what made the interview successful, what you would
    change, and what you need to improve. These notes can be invaluable information
    for you to review and work on for future interviews.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18439"><b id="B-18440"><span id="SPAN-18441">14.25. Interview Conclusion.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-18442"><span id="SPAN-18443">The
    job interview is the most important step in any job-search process. Many Airmen
    will undergo the rigors of an interview for special positions during the course
    of their careers. Understanding the purpose of the job interview and your role
    in successfully planning for and conducting a proper interview can greatly
    increase your chances of landing a coveted job in the Air Force.</span></p>

    <p id="P-18451"><span id="SPAN-18452">Meetings are used to

    <p id="P-18453"><span id="SPAN-18454">14.26.1.<b id="B-18455">&nbsp;Planning the Meeting.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18456"><span id="SPAN-18457">Success or failure in a
    meeting can usually be traced to the planning phase. The key issues associated
    with planning a meeting are listed below. As you review these items, remember
    to check on what are standard operating procedures in your organization.
    Meetings come in all flavors from totally spontaneous to highly structured and
    ceremonial. Most are in the middle. If a group has been meeting regularly for a
    while, try to find out how they have done business in the past.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18458"><span id="SPAN-18459">14.26.1.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18460">Decide if the Meeting is
    Appropriate.</b>&nbsp;If you can achieve the goal by speaking face-to-face with
    one or two people, scheduling a formal meeting might not be necessary. If the
    goal is to just pass on information, consider if sending an e-mail is a viable
    and appropriate substitute for the meeting.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18461"><span id="SPAN-18462">14.26.1.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18463">Define
    the Purpose.</b>&nbsp;Every meeting should have a purpose and if there is no
    purpose, you should not meet. When thinking about the purpose, define in terms
    of the product wanted at the end of the meeting and what purpose will the
    product be used for.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18464"><span id="SPAN-18465">14.26.1.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-18466">Decide
    Who Should Be Invited.</b>&nbsp;Invite only those directly involved in the
    issues being discussed. If you are trying to solve a problem or make a decision
    on a controversial issue, make sure you have adequate representation from all
    groups who have a voice in the decision. If you only invite people with one
    point of view, your meeting will run smoothly, but your decision may not stand
    up later.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18467"><span id="SPAN-18468">14.26.1.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-18469">Decide

    Information during the Meeting.</b>&nbsp;This can be done by using standard
    note-taking procedures. Ensuring your meeting place has either a dry erase
    board, butcher paper, or other note-taking capabilities will assist in getting
    this accomplished.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18476"><span id="SPAN-18477">14.26.1.5.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-18478">Capturing

    later than 1 or 2 days before the meeting. The agenda should include the date,
    time, location, and purpose of the meeting. This advance notice gives everyone
    an opportunity to prepare their thoughts and know where the meeting is going

    you are in charge of a group that will meet over a period of time, you should
    learn the basics about group dynamics. In group dynamics which will be
    experienced in meetings, teams or groups move through predictable stages. To
    avoid frustration, becoming familiar with these stages is important.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18496"><span id="SPAN-18497">14.26.2.3.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-18498">Forming
    Stage.&nbsp;</b>When a team is forming, members cautiously explore the
    boundaries of acceptable group behavior. The forming stage is a stage of
    transition from individual to member status, and of testing the leader s
    guidance, both formally and informally. Because so much is going on to distract
    the members' attention in the beginning, the team accomplishes little, if
    anything, that is concerned with the project goals. Do not be overly concerned;
    this is perfectly normal!</span></p>

    Stage.</b>&nbsp;Probably the most difficult stage for the team is the storming
    stage. The team members begin to realize the task is different and more
    difficult than imagined and they become testy, accusatory, or overzealous.
    Impatient about the lack of progress, but still too inexperienced to know much
    about decision making or the scientific approach, members argue about what
    actions the team should take. They try to rely solely on their personal and
    professional experience, resisting any need for collaborating with other team
    members. Their behavior means team members have little energy to spend on
    progressing toward the team's goal, but they are beginning to understand one
    another.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18502"><span id="SPAN-18503">14.26.2.3.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-18504">Norming
    Stage.&nbsp;</b>During the norming stage, members reconcile competing loyalties
    and responsibilities. They accept the team, team ground rules (or  norms ),
    their roles in the team, and the individuality of fellow members. Emotional
    conflict is reduced as previously competitive relationships become more
    cooperative. As team members begin to work out their differences, they now have
    more time and energy to spend on the project. Thus, they are able to at last
    start making significant strides.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18505"><span id="SPAN-18506">14.26.2.3.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-18507">Performing
    Stage.</b>&nbsp;By the time of the performing stage, the team has settled their
    relationships and expectations. At last, team members have discovered and
    accepted each other's strengths and weaknesses and learned what their roles
    are. The team is now an effective, cohesive unit. They can begin
    performing diagnosing and solving problems, and choosing and implementing
    changes. You can tell when your team has reached the performing stage because
    you start getting a lot of work done finally!</span></p>

    concise, well-thought-out, and well-composed communication is essential for
    meeting the needs of today's Air Force. We are all involved in speaking and
    writing to some extent. Therefore, we must become proficient at the methods we
    use. The meeting is an important forum for providing information, solving
    problems, and answering questions. Written communication is also another area
    crucial to meeting the Air Force mission. Fortunately, we have several
    instruments at our disposal to help us with the process. The staff summary

    The Air Force requires military members to be prepared to serve and support the
    mission at all times. Force support organizations ensure Airmen and their
    families are cared for, pay and entitlements are properly addressed, and their
    individual rights are secure. Airmen need to comprehend the enlisted
    assignments, family care, reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits
    and services, personnel records and individual rights, the awards and
    decorations program, and the enlisted promotion systems programs and policies.
    Each of these areas has an impact, in some form or fashion, on every Airman;
    therefore, understanding the individual nuances associated with each of these
    programs is a necessity for all Airmen. The senior NCO promotion program,
    manpower management and requirements, competitive sourcing, and civilian
    personnel management programs, are all necessary areas of focus for our
    aspiring senior NCOs. A basic understanding of these subject areas are required
    to effectively lead Airmen and manage programs.</span></p>

    <p id="P-18753"><span id="SPAN-18754">Qualified
    Airmen must be in the right jobs at the right time to accomplish the Air Force
    mission. The Air Force classifies and assigns Airmen worldwide as equitably as
    possible to ensure a high state of readiness. The Air Force also recognizes a
    need for special assignment considerations to take care of Air Force Airmen
    with exceptional needs. The Air Force uses a coherent and logical classification
    system to identify valid manpower requirements, to identify and describe each
    Air Force occupational specialty, to ensure minimum prerequisite standards are
    set for each specialty, and to ensure qualified Airmen are placed into each
    specialty. While the primary consideration in selecting Airmen for reassignment
    is the Airmen's qualifications to accomplish the mission, the Air Force also
    considers additional factors:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18755"><span id="SPAN-18756">15.2.1. To the maximum
    extent possible, the Air Force assigns Airmen on a voluntary basis and in the
    most equitable manner feasible.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18757"><span id="SPAN-18758">15.2.2. The Air Force
    equitably distributes involuntary assignments among similarly qualified Airmen
    to minimize family separation and to avoid creating a severe personal hardship
    on Airmen.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18759"><span id="SPAN-18760">15.2.3.
    Limitations may be established on involuntary selection for permanent change of
    station following some temporary duties to allow Airmen to attend essential
    military and personal pre-permanent change of station requirements, as well as
    to reduce Airmen and family turbulence.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18761"><b id="B-18762"><span id="SPAN-18763">15.3. Assignment Authority.</span></b><span id="SPAN-18764">&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18765"><span id="SPAN-18766">The
    Department of Defense allocates funds, delegates authority, and directs
    policies for the permanent change of station assignment of Airmen to satisfy
    national security requirements. Permanent change of station assignments may
    also be directed to ensure equitable treatment of Airmen, such as permanent change
    of station from overseas to the continental United States upon completion of
    the prescribed overseas tour. Air Force Instruction 36-2110,&nbsp;<i id="I-18767">Assignments,</i>&nbsp;is

    authorizations. Air Force Personnel Center is the final approval authority for
    Airman assignments. The Airman Assignment Division is the final approval
    authority for Airman assignments in the grades of Senior Master Sergeant and

    <p id="P-18784"><span id="SPAN-18785">The Air Force assigns
    Airmen without regard to color, race, religious preference (except chaplains),
    national origin, ethnic background, age, marital status (except military
    couples), spouse's employment, education or volunteer service activities of
    spouse, or gender (except as provided for by statute or other policies). This
    applies to both permanent change of station and temporary duty assignments. The
    primary factor in selecting Airmen for permanent change of station is the
    Airmen's qualifications to fill a valid manpower requirement and perform
    productively in the position for which being considered. When Airmen with the
    required qualifications are identified, then permanent change of station
    eligibility criteria and other factors are considered.</span></p>

    <p id="P-18789"><span id="SPAN-18790">The
    special experience identifier system complements the assignment process and is
    used in conjunction with grade, Air Force specialty code, Air Force specialty
    code prefixes and suffixes, etc., to match uniquely qualified Airmen to jobs
    with special requirements. Special experience identifiers may be used when
    specific experience or training is critical to the job, and no other means is
    appropriate or available. The special experience identifier system is also used
    to rapidly identify Airmen to meet unique circumstances, contingency
    requirements, or other critical needs. Manpower positions are coded with a
    special experience identifier to identify positions that require or provide
    unique experiences or qualifications. The personnel records for the Airmen who
    earn a special experience identifier are similarly coded.</span></p>

    positions often require Airmen assigned to have access to a specified level of
    classified information. However, sometimes the urgency to fill a position does
    not allow selection of Airmen using permanent change of station eligibility
    criteria and subsequent processing (and/or investigation) for access at the
    specified level. Under these circumstances, selection may be necessary from
    among Airmen who currently have access or can be granted access

    Master Sergeants and Chief Master Sergeant-selects may be assigned in any Air
    Force specialty code or chief enlisted manager code they possess or are
    qualified to be awarded. Normally, Airmen in the grade of Senior Master
    Sergeants and below are selected for assignment in their control Air Force
    specialty code. Airmen with an incompatible grade and control Air Force
    specialty code skill level because of retraining or reclassification are
    selected for assignment and allocated against requirements commensurate with
    their grade, regardless of their control Air Force specialty code skill level.
    Normally, Airmen are selected based on their grade and skill level. Chief
    Master Sergeants fill chief enlisted manager code positions; Senior Master
    Sergeants fill 9-skill level positions; Master Sergeants and Technical
    Sergeants fill 7-skill level positions; Staff Sergeants and Senior Airman fill
    5-skill level positions; and Airman First Class, Airman, and Airman Basic fill

    a group of qualified Airmen who meet the minimum eligibility criteria for
    permanent change of station selection, volunteers are selected ahead of
    nonvolunteers. Furthermore, nonvolunteers qualified to fill a requirement who
    meet the minimum permanent change of station eligibility criteria are selected
    ahead of qualified volunteers who do not meet permanent change of station
    eligibility criteria. For example, time on station is a permanent change of
    station eligibility requirement. A qualified volunteer who meets the minimum time
    on station requirement is considered first in order of longest on station.
    Next, the qualified nonvolunteer who meets the time on station requirement in
    the order of longest on station, and finally the qualified volunteer who does

    Air Force/DPE uses the Chief Master Sergeant assignment policies to support the
    continued development of Chief Master Sergeants. Because Chief Master Sergeants
    are Air Force senior leaders, these policies are comparable with other senior
    leader assignment and development methods. Policies include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18812"><span id="SPAN-18813">15.4.6.1.<b id="B-18814">&nbsp;Three-year
    Limits for Headquarters Staff and Special Duty Tours.&nbsp;</b>Chief Master
    Sergeants serving in major command, Headquarters Air Force, and Joint Staff
    positions, as well as special duty positions will be limited to serving 3-year
    tours. This increases the opportunities for Chief Master Sergeants to serve in
    these positions, enhancing their development. Additionally, this improves the
    flow of field experience into headquarters staff positions and staff experience
    into base-level units.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18815"><span id="SPAN-18816">15.4.6.2.<b id="B-18817">&nbsp;Date
    Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) Management.&nbsp;</b>DEROS adjustment
    requests, like DEROS extensions, indefinite DEROSs, and in-place consecutive
    overseas tours, are closely scrutinized for Chief Master Sergeants and only
    considered if in the best interest of the Air Force and supportive of Chief
    Master Sergeant development. Subsequently, DEROS adjustments are not routinely
    approved for Chief Master Sergeants.</span></p>

    for these positions requests nominations from appropriate organizations,
    frequently each major command. Each organization then identifies their most
    qualified Chief Master Sergeants for the advertised position and nominates them
    to the hiring authority. The hiring authority then selects the best Airman for

    reassignment, Expedited Transfers and Exceptional Family Member Program
    reassignment or deferment are outlined in AFI 36-2110. These policies and
    procedures include but are not limited to:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18840"><span id="SPAN-18841">15.4.8.1.1.
    The Humanitarian Program provides reassignment or deferment for Airmen to help
    them resolve severe short-term problems involving a family member. The problem
    must be resolvable within a reasonable period of time (normally 12 months); the
    Airman's presence must be considered absolutely essential to resolve the
    problem; and the Airman must be effectively utilized in his or her control Air
    Force specialty code at the new assignment. Family members under the
    humanitarian program are limited to spouse, children, parents, parents-in-law,
    and those people who have served  in loco parentis.  A person  in loco
    parentis' refers to one who has exercised parental rights and responsibilities
    in place of a natural parent for at least 5 years before the Airman's or
    spouse's 21st birthday, or before the Airman's entry to the Regular Air Force,
    whichever is earlier. While brothers and sisters are not included in the
    definition of family member for humanitarian consideration, a request involving
    a brother's or sister's terminal illness will be considered as an exception to policy.</span></p>

    program from humanitarian policy.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-18846"><span id="SPAN-18847">The
    Exceptional Family Member Program is based on an Airman's need for special
    medical or educational care for a spouse or child that is required long term,
    possibly permanently. Therefore, this program is not a base-of-choice program,
    as assignment decisions are based on manning needs of the Air Force at
    locations where the special medical or educational needs for a spouse or child
    can be met. The Air Force's commitment and responsibilities under the
    Exceptional Family Member Program requires mandatory enrollment and
    identification of exceptional family members. Under the Exceptional Family
    Member Program, an Airman may receive a reassignment if a need arises for
    specialized care that cannot be met where currently assigned. A deferment from
    an assignment may be provided for a newly identified condition if the Airman s
    presence is considered essential. The purpose of such a deferment is to allow
    the Airman time to establish a special medical treatment program or educational
    program for the exceptional family member. When granted, the initial period of
    deferment is usually 12 months, after which an Airman may be reconsidered for
    permanent change of station, if otherwise eligible.</span></p>

    Air Force members who are sexually assaulted and file an unrestricted report.
    The Airman may request an Expedited Transfer with assistance from the Sexual
    Assault Prevention and Response Office. If an Airman is the victim of stalking
    or other sexual misconduct (i.e. indecent viewing, visual recording, or
    broadcasting; forcible pandering; indecent exposure) and files a report, the
    Airman may also request an expedited transfer with assistance from the Victim
    and Witness Assistance Program in the installation's Legal Office. An expedited
    transfer request initiated on behalf of another will not be accepted. Only
    exception applies to the vice wing commander applying on behalf of the alleged
    offender. To enhance protection for the sexual assault victim, potential
    reassignment of the alleged offender shall be considered by the vice wing
    commander (or equivalent), balancing interests of the sexual assault victim and
    the alleged offender. An Airman (victim or alleged offender) will generally
    only be delayed from departing permanent change of station when they are
    required to remain for completion of a criminal or disciplinary investigation
    or action in which they are the subject. All assignment action codes must be
    removed from the Airman's personnel file in order to facilitate permanent
    change of station eligibility. Retraining or cross-flow actions will be considered
    under this program on a case by case basis as the goal for transferring the
    Airman is a timely reassignment with minimal disruption to an Airman's career
    and family.</span></p>

    program is a reenlistment incentive. The Career Airman base of preference
    program is an incentive for other Airmen to continue an Air Force career.
    First-term Airmen in conjunction with reenlistment or retraining may request a
    permanent change of station from continental United States-to-continental
    United States or permanent change of station from overseas-tocontinental United
    States. First-term Airmen in the continental United States (only) may request a

    valid manning requirements and must perform duties that require the skills in
    which they are trained. Provided these criteria are met, military couples may
    be considered for assignments where they can maintain a joint residence.
    Military couples share the responsibility for reducing family separation. They
    should not make decisions on future service, career development, or family
    planning based on the assumption they will always be assigned to the same

    program applies to Airmen who volunteer for permanent change of station
    overseas to a long-tour location (one where the accompanied tour length is 24
    months or more, and the unaccompanied tour length is more than 15 months).
    Airmen who volunteer for an extended long overseas tour agree to serve the
    standard tour length plus an additional 12 months. Tour lengths for various
    overseas locations are listed in the Joint Travel Regulation, Volume 1,
    Appendix Q. Extended long overseas tour volunteers are considered ahead of
    standard overseas tour volunteers according to the priorities shown in AFI
    36-2110. The 12-month extended tour period is in addition to the normal
    (accompanied or unaccompanied) long tour length the Airman must serve. A change
    in status affects the service retainability that must be obtained and the tour
    length the Airman will be required to serve. The requirement for additional

    Back-to-back deferments may be possible and military-married-to-military
    spouses may also apply. As in all situations, however, the needs of the Air
    Force will come first and will be the determining factor in granting
    deferments. Requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and deferments

    procedures. The maximum temporary duty period at any one location in a 12-month
    period is 180 days unless the Secretary of the Air Force grants a waiver. To
    the degree possible, Airmen are not selected for involuntary overseas permanent
    change of station while performing certain kinds of temporary duty.

    expected to fulfill their military obligations on the same basis as other
    Airmen. They are eligible for worldwide duty and all assignments for which they
    qualify. To ensure all Airmen remain available for worldwide duty, they must
    have workable plans to provide parent-like care for their dependents as
    outlined in AFI 36-2908,<i id="I-18876">&nbsp;Family Care Plans</i>. Airmen who cannot or
    will not meet military commitments due to family needs will be considered for
    discharge. Airmen adopting children are given a limited time to complete the
    official adoption process and facilitate bonding. Airmen may be authorized
    deferment during the 6-month period following the date a child is officially
    placed in the Airmen's home. Airmen may also be authorized up to 21 days of

    time on station requirements exist to provide continuity to an Airman s

    life for Airmen. Further, upon selection for permanent change of station, an
    Airman must have or be able to obtain certain minimum periods of obligated
    service depending on the type of permanent change of station move. This
    committed service retainability ensures an Airman has a period of Regular Air
    Force remaining long enough to offset the costs associated with a permanent
    change of station. Minimum time on station provides continuity to the gaining
    unit and stability to Airmen and their families following permanent change of
    station. Some types of permanent change of station require time on station
    periods or obligated service periods more or less than the normal limits. Refer
    to AFI 36-2110 for the time on station and retainability requirements for
    specific types of permanent change of station.</span></p>

    for most voluntary assignments. Airmen who are eligible and desire that their
    dependents accompany them at government expense during their overseas tours
    must serve the  accompanied by dependents' overseas tour length. This tour is
    normally longer than the unaccompanied tour. Electing to serve the longer

    if the individual needs 15   months of retainability for an assignment, the
    individual must request a 16-month extension. Voluntary extensions for all
    Airmen are limited to a maximum of 48 months per enlistment. In the event Air
    Force specialty codes are constrained, Air Staff may limit first-term Airmen
    extensions to a specified period. Certain situations (such as citizenship
    pending) may warrant exceptions to policy. Once approved, an extension has the
    legal effect of the enlistment agreement by extending the period of obligated
    service. Extensions can only be canceled if the reason for the extension no
    longer exists, given the Airman has not entered into the extension. For
    example, if a member was approved for an extension due to an assignment and
    that assignment was canceled, the member could then cancel the extension within
    30 calendar days provided they have not entered into the extension period.</span></p>

    tax free monetary benefit paid to Veterans with disabilities that are the
    result of a disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active military
    service. Compensation may also be paid for post-service disabilities that are
    considered related or secondary to disabilities occurring in service and for
    disabilities presumed to be related to circumstances of military service, even
    though they may arise after service. Generally, the degrees of disability specified
    are also designed to compensate for considerable loss of working time from
    exacerbations or illnesses. The benefit amount is graduated according to the
    degree of the Veteran's disability on a scale from 10 percent to 100 percent
    (in increments of 10 percent). Compensation may also be paid for disabilities
    that are considered related or secondary to disabilities occurring in service
    and for disabilities presumed to be related to circumstances of military
    service, even though they may arise after service. Generally, the degrees of
    disability specified are also designed to compensate for considerable loss of
    working time from exacerbations or illnesses. If you have dependents, an
    additional allowance may be added if your combined disability is rated 30% or
    greater. Your compensation may be offset if you receive military retirement
    pay, disability severance pay, or separation incentive payments. Finally,

    Military pay stops when a member dies. Established by Congress on 21 September
    1972, the survivor benefit plan provides a monthly income to survivors of
    retired military personnel upon the member's death. The survivor benefit plan
    is a government program for retiring members to ensure their eligible survivors
    receive a portion of their military retired pay in the form of a monthly
    annuity after their death. The plan was structured so a surviving spouse cannot
    outlive the annuity, and cost-of-living adjustments are incorporated to offset
    inflation. Regular Air Force members with a spouse or dependent children are
    automatically covered by the survivor benefit plan at no cost while they remain
    on Regular Air Force. The member's death must be classified in line of duty in
    order for an annuity to be payable if the member is not yet retirement eligible
    (has not accrued 20 years of Regular Air Force) on the date of death. The
    annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the member would have been
    entitled to receive if retired with a total disability rating on the date of
    death. An annuity may also be payable if the member's death is classified not
    in line of duty, as long as the member was retirement eligible on the date of
    death. In this case, annuity payable is 55 percent of the retired pay the
    member would have been entitled to receive if retired for years of service on
    the date of death. The surviving spouse of a member who dies in the line of
    duty while on Regular Air Force may request the survivor benefit plan be paid
    only to the member's children, avoiding the reduction caused by a spouse s
    receipt of dependency and indemnity compensation, the survivor benefits paid by
    the Department of Veteran Affairs when a member's death is determined to have
    resulted from a serviceconnected cause.</span></p>

    paid to a member's survivors. Prior to retiring, each member must decide
    whether to continue survivor benefit plan coverage into retirement.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-19417"><span id="SPAN-19418">If
    electing coverage, survivor benefit plan premiums are assessed and
    automatically deducted from the member's monthly retired pay. Premiums are
    government-subsidized and deducted from a participating member's retired pay
    before taxes.&nbsp; 15.19.3. Survivor benefit plan premiums and beneficiary
    annuity payments depend on what is called the  base amount  elected as the
    basis of coverage. A service member's base amount can be the full monthly
    retired pay or a portion of retired pay, down to $300. Full coverage means
    full-retired pay is elected as the base amount. The base amount is tied to a
    member's retired pay; therefore, when retired pay receives cost-of-living
    adjustments, so does the base amount, and as a result, so do premiums and the
    annuity payments.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-19419"><span id="SPAN-19420">15.19.4. Generally the
    survivor benefit plan is an irrevocable decision. However, under limited

    change your coverage. As a survivor benefit plan participant, you have a 1-year
    window to terminate survivor benefit plan coverage between the second and third
    anniversary following the date you begin to receive retired pay. The premiums
    you paid will not be refunded, and an annuity will not be payable upon your
    death. Your covered spouse or former spouse must consent to the withdrawal.
    Termination is permanent, and participation may not be resumed under any
    circumstance barring future enrollment. The survivor benefit plan also has a
     paid-up  feature that permits members who have attained age 70 and who have
    paid survivor benefit plan premiums for 360 months to stop paying premiums but
    remain active participants in the plan. Additional information can be attained

    Force Board for Correction of Military Records; however, an applicant must
    exhaust other reasonably available administrative avenues of relief prior to
    applying to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records. For
    instance, Enlisted Performance Reports may be voided, upgraded, or rewritten;
    discharges and reenlistment/reentry eligibility codes may be upgraded; survivor
    benefit plan elections may be changed; leave may be credited; Article 15
    actions may be voided; reinstatement into the Air Force may be achieved, etc.
    Records may be changed, voided, or created as necessary to correct an error or
    to remove an injustice, and applicable monetary benefits are recomputed based
    on the records changed. The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records
    cannot, however, change the verdict of a courts-martial imposed after 5 May

    Application to the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records is a
    simple process. However, favorable consideration of the application depends on
    all the facts and circumstances of the case and how well the request is
    supported by documentary evidence. The Air Force Board for Correction of
    Military Records is not an investigative body and except in those rare cases
    where a personal appearance is granted and testimony is taken, and the decision
    is based on the evidence contained in the case file. This normally consists of
    the applicant's submission (e.g. statements, arguments, documentary evidence, etc.),
    military record, and advisory opinion(s) from the Air Force office of primary
    responsibility. There is a presumption of regularity on the part of the
    government and absent evidence to the contrary is assumed that all government
    officials exercised their duties in accordance with law and policy. Because of
    this, the applicant bears the burden of providing sufficient evidence to
    establish the existence of an error or an injustice in record. The type and
    extent of evidence necessary to support the case depends on the nature of the
    request.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-19698"><span id="SPAN-19699">15.25.5. Cases are
    reviewed in executive session by a panel of three members, randomly selected
    from the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records membership. These
    members, General Schedule-15s and above, the majority of whom are members of
    the Senior Executive Service cadre, are appointed from the executive part of
    the department and serve at the discretion of the Secretary. However, service
    on the board is a collateral, volunteer duty. Applicants may request a personal
    appearance before the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records;
    however, a personal appearance is not a statutory right and is granted solely
    at the discretion of the Board, predicated on the finding the applicant s
    presence, without or without counsel, will materially add to the Board s
    understanding of the issue(s) involved. Few personal appearances are granted
    and the decision to conduct such a hearing is made at the time the Board
    initially adjudicates the application. During deliberations, which are
    conducted in Executive Session, Board members decide whether the applicant has
    first exhausted all available avenues of administrative relief; whether the
    application has been timely filed and if not, whether the failure to do so
    should be waived in the interest of justice; whether the provisions of Title
    10, United States Code, Section 1034 apply to the case, and whether an error or
    an injustice exists. The Board is a recommending body on all cases and will
    vote to grant, partially grant, and deny the requested relief. If the board
    recommends favorable relief, the case is forwarded to the Secretary of the Air
    Force's designee for final decision. Applicants have the right to request
    reconsideration of the Board's decision; however, reconsideration is granted
    only if the applicant can provide newly discovered relevant evidence that was
    not reasonably available when the original application was submitted.</span></p>

    nature and magnitude</span><span id="SPAN-19788"><span id="SPAN-19789">.&nbsp;</span></span><span id="SPAN-19790">The
    acts or services recognized must place the unit's performance above that of
    other units similar in composition and mission and be of such importance that
    they cannot be appropriately recognized in any other way. Only one unit award
    is awarded for the same achievement or service. The unit's entire service must
    have been honorable during the distinguished act. An organization may display
    the award elements of a unit award. Designated subordinate units of the
    organization may also share in the award; however, higher organizations may
    not. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a period for
    which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they
    directly contributed to the mission and accomplishments of the unit. Questions
    concerning eligibility to wear a specific unit award may be directed to the
    local military personnel section. The five most common unit awards worn by Air

    Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, the Air Force Organizational Excellence

    Unit Citation.</b>&nbsp;The Gallant Unit Citation was approved by the Secretary
    of the Air Force in March 2004 and is awarded to Air Force units for
    extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States
    while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing
    foreign force on or after 11 September 2001. The unit must have performed with
    marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing
    its mission so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in
    the same conflict. The Gallant Unit Citation will normally be earned by units
    that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively

    service in direct support of combat operations for at least 90 continuous days
    during the period of military operations against an armed enemy of the United
    States on or after 11 September 2001. Superior performance of normal mission
    alone will not justify award of the Meritorious Unit Award. Service in a combat
    zone is not required, but service must be directly related to the combat
    effort. The Meritorious Unit Award is not awarded to any unit or unit component

    established and awarded in the name of the Secretary of the Air Force 6 Jan
    1954. The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award is awarded only to numbered units or
    numbered Air Forces, air divisions, wings, groups, and squadrons. To be awarded
    the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, an organization must have performed
    meritorious service or outstanding achievements that clearly set the unit above
    and apart from similar units. Commanders must annually review the
    accomplishments of their eligible subordinate units and recommend only those
    units that are truly exceptional. Only 10 percent of similar units assigned to
    a command are recommended annually. Commanders send Air Force Outstanding Unit
    Award recommendations to their major commands for consideration. Certain
    recommendations for the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award are exempt from annual
    submission. These are recommendations for specific achievements, combat
    operations, or conflict with hostile forces.</span></p>

    competition among the nominees is keen. The commander's nomination alone serves
    as a meaningful recognition because nomination places the individual in

    such importance that the person cannot receive proper recognition in any other
    way. When an individual is being considered for a decoration, the determining
    factors are level of responsibility, achievements, accomplishments, manner of
    performance, and the impact of the accomplishment. Each decoration has specific
    performance requirements for award, and an individual may receive only one
    decoration for any act, achievement, or period of service. Specific criteria

    approved retirement, declination for extension or reenlistment, court-martial
    conviction, control roster action, not recommended by the commander, failure to
    appear for scheduled testing without a valid reason, absent without leave, etc.
    When individuals are ineligible for promotion, they cannot test; cannot be
    considered if already tested; and the projected promotion, if already selected,
    will be canceled.</span></p>

    Personnel Center assigns promotion sequence numbers to Airmen selected for
    promotion to Staff Sergeants through Chief Master Sergeant based on date of

    service will be required to obtain 2-years retainability to serve the 2-year

    date of promotion and will be required to obtain 3-years retainability
    (regardless of total active federal military service) to serve the 3-year

    to promotion. The promotion fitness examination and specialty knowledge test

    Under Stripes for Exceptional Performers, commanders of major commands and
    field operating agencies and senior officers in organizations with large enlisted
    populations may promote a limited number of Airmen with exceptional potential
    to the grades of Staff Sergeant through Technical Sergeant (each major command
    determines their own procedures and Stripes for Exceptional Performers
    selection levels). The commander must ensure personnel who are promoted meet
    eligibility requirements including completion of the appropriate enlisted
    professional military education. An individual may not receive more than one
    promotion under any combination of promotion programs within a 12-month period.
    (<b id="B-20792">Exception:</b>&nbsp;A Senior Airman must serve 6 months of time in grade

    achievements should not be the sole basis for promotion under this program.
    Stripes for Exceptional Performers promotion opportunities are limited,
    therefore Commanders are encouraged to recognize and promote their exemplary
    performers who meet the minimum promotion eligibility criteria. Date of rank

    promotion testing is solely an individual responsibility. Weighted Airman
    Promotion System score notices are a means to give Airmen a report of their
    relative standing in the promotion consideration process and should never be
    provided to or used by anyone other than the individual and his or her
    commander. An Airman's scores cannot be disclosed without the Airman's written
    consent. Commanders support staff, first sergeants, supervisors, etc., are not
    authorized access to an Airman's Weighted Airman Promotion System scores. The
    commander has the specific duty to notify Airmen of promotion selection or
    nonselection results and may need to review their score notices to determine
    status. Commanders must restrict their use of the scores to notification and
    advisory counseling on behalf of the Airman and must not allow further
    dissemination of scores. Individuals may retrieve a copy of their score notice
    on the virtual military personnel flight after the initial promotion selection
    for the current cycle.</span></p>

    considers academic education completed on or before the promotion eligibility
    cutoff date. Up to three academic education levels can be reflected on the
    senior NCO evaluation brief. When the academic education level is updated in
    the personnel data system, the promotion file is updated and a new data
    verification record and evaluation brief is produced to reflect the change. If
    the Community College of the Air Force degree was awarded by Community College
    of the Air Force or any other accredited college requirements were completed
    before the promotion eligibility cutoff date but the evaluation brief was
    completed within 10 days of the board convening date, the education services
    office will update the personnel data system. The individual must notify the
    Air Force Personnel Center by message of this update. This information is then
    used to post the senior NCO evaluation brief filed in the senior NCO selection
    folder. Promotion eligible Airmen are responsible for ensuring this data is

    performance reports). Approved decorations, resubmissions, or decorations being
    upgraded must be submitted and placed into official channels before the

    Board.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22141"><span id="SPAN-22142">The evaluation
    board is very important because the evaluation board accounts for over half the
    total score. Understanding how board members are selected, the evaluation board
    process, and those areas considered by board members can provide valuable
    insight into what is required to get promoted.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22143"><span id="SPAN-22144">15.49.1.<b id="B-22145">&nbsp;Selection of Board Members.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22146"><span id="SPAN-22147">The number of
    promotion eligible personnel identified by major command and Air Force
    specialty codes determines the number and career field backgrounds of the board
    members. Board members are divided into panels, each consisting of one colonel
    and two Chief Master Sergeants. The board president is always a general
    officer. Before evaluating records, board members are briefed on the task
    objective, eligible population profile, and selection folder content. Board
    members are then sworn to complete the board's task without prejudice or
    partiality. They also participate in an extensive trial-run process to ensure
    scoring consistency before evaluating any  live  records.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22148"><span id="SPAN-22149">15.49.2.<b id="B-22150">&nbsp;Areas the Board Considers.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22151"><span id="SPAN-22152">The board looks at performance,
    education, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence,
    specific achievements, and leadership. In each area, the individual has control
    over the information the board reviews. Individuals therefore not board
    members are responsible for their own promotions by ensuring the board receives
    the most current updates.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22153"><span id="SPAN-22154">15.49.2.1.<b id="B-22155">&nbsp;Performance.</b>&nbsp;The
    evaluation board reviews all enlisted performance reports for the 5 years
    preceding the promotion eligibility cutoff date. The board members consider all
    aspects of the enlisted performance report  job description (key duties, tasks,
    and responsibilities), individual rating factors, periods of supervision,
    overall evaluations, levels of endorsements, and each narrative word picture.
    If the person is an exceptional performer, the enlisted performance reports
    should convey to the board that he or she has demonstrated the highest
    qualities required of a leader and manager.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22156"><span id="SPAN-22157">15.49.2.2.<b id="B-22158">&nbsp;Education.</b>&nbsp;When
    considering educational opportunities, enlisted members should focus on a
    degree program that complements their career field and enhances their ability
    to do their job. When the board evaluates academic education as part of the
    whole-person assessment, the most important consideration should be the degree
    to which the education enhances the member's potential to serve in the next
    higher grade.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22159"><span id="SPAN-22160">15.49.2.3.<b id="B-22161">&nbsp;Breadth
    of Experience.</b>&nbsp;This factor refers to the individual's overall
    professional background, experience, and knowledge gained during his or her career
    to the present. Board members consider knowledge and practical experience in
    areas other than the current Air Force specialty code. If the eligible
    individual remained in one career field, board members consider whether he or
    she had wide exposure across the career field. Board members also consider
    potential to fill other types of jobs, as well as supervisory and managerial
    experience.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22162"><span id="SPAN-22163">15.49.2.4.<b id="B-22164">&nbsp;Job
    Responsibility.</b>&nbsp;This factor does not refer entirely to the career
    field's command-level positions, although experience at this level is a
    consideration. Many base-level jobs demand just as much of an individual as
    jobs at higher command levels. Consideration is primarily given to what was
    asked of the individual and how well the individual accomplished the task. Did
    the job require significant decisions, or was it a job in which the individual
    routinely carried out the decisions of others? Is the individual a proven,
    effective leader, responsible for directing the work of others, or is the
    person responsible only for his or her own performance?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22165"><span id="SPAN-22166">15.49.2.5.<b id="B-22167">&nbsp;Professional
    Competence.</b>&nbsp;What do rating and endorsing officials say about the
    individual's expertise? Is it truly outstanding? How much does the individual
    know about the job, and how well does he or she accomplish it? The Air Force
    Chief of Staff has emphasized the need for careful selection of individuals for
    promotion to the senior NCO grades. Therefore, those selected must be the best
    qualified. They must have sufficient leadership and managerial experience to
    prepare them for the challenges they, and the Air Force, face.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22168"><span id="SPAN-22169">15.49.2.6.<b id="B-22170">&nbsp;Specific
    Achievements.</b>&nbsp;These are often recognized in the form of awards and
    decorations. However, many other significant accomplishments are often
    addressed in the enlisted performance report's narrative comments. Such
    recognition, either in the form of decorations or narrative comments, can help
    board members identify truly outstanding performers.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22171"><span id="SPAN-22172">15.49.2.7.<b id="B-22173">&nbsp;Leadership.</b>&nbsp;Board
    members use their judgment, expertise, and maturity when reviewing records to
    assess a member's potential to serve in a higher grade. In particular, board
    members evaluate leadership potential. How well does he or she manage, lead,
    and interact with peers and subordinates? What have rating officials said about
    the person's leadership qualities and potential? What haven t they said?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22174"><b id="B-22175"><span id="SPAN-22176">15.50.</span></b><span id="SPAN-22177">&nbsp;<b id="B-22178">Evaluation

    <p id="P-22179"><span id="SPAN-22180">15.50.1.<b id="B-22181">&nbsp;Trial Run.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22182"><span id="SPAN-22183">As previously
    mentioned, board members are given two selected sets of records to score as a
    practice exercise before the actual scoring process. Using the whole-person
    concept, they score the records using secret ballots. This process helps
    establish a scoring standard they can apply consistently throughout the board
    process.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22184"><span id="SPAN-22185">15.50.2.<b id="B-22186">&nbsp;Scoring:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22187"><span id="SPAN-22188">15.50.2.1. After
    the trial run is completed and discussed, panels begin the actual scoring of
    live records. The same panel evaluates all eligibles competing in a chief
    enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code. Each panel member scores
    each record, using a 6- to 10-point scale and half-point increments. An
    individual's record may receive a panel composite score (3 members) from a
    minimum of 18 (6-6-6) to a maximum of 30 (10-10-10) points. The composite score
    (18 to 30 points) is later multiplied by a factor of 15, resulting in a total board
    score (270 to 450). Using a secret ballot, panel members score the record
    individually with no discussion. Records are given to each panel member, and
    after they are scored, the ballots are given directly to a recorder. This
    ensures each panel member has scored each record independently.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22189"><span id="SPAN-22190">15.50.2.2. A record scored with a difference of more than 1 point
    between any of the panel members (for example, 8.5, 8.0, and 7.0) is termed a
    split vote and is returned to the panel for resolution. At this point, all
    panel members may discuss the record openly among themselves. This allows them
    to state why they scored the record as they did. Only those panel members
    directly involved in the split may change their scores. If panel members cannot
    come to an agreement on the split vote, they give the record to the board
    president for resolution. This ensures consistency of scoring and eliminates
    the possibility that one panel member will have a major impact (positive or
    negative) on an individual's board score.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22191"><span id="SPAN-22192">15.50.2.3. Actual
    scores will vary between panels; the specific reason why certain panels scored
    the way they did cannot be determined because this is a subjective decision.
    However, because a single panel reviews each chief enlisted manager code or Air
    Force specialty code, all records within a chief enlisted manager code or Air
    Force specialty code are evaluated under the same standard. Some panels may
    award high scores, while others may award low ones. Therefore, whether a panel
    scores  easy  or  hard  is not significant. The important part of the final
    board score is how one eligible compares to his or her peers in the final order
    of merit. This allows each eligible to see how competitive he or she was.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22193"><span id="SPAN-22194">15.50.2.4. Because
    each board is completely independent, board members do not know how an
    individual scored or ranked during the previous cycle. Each board arrives at
    their own scoring standard. However, as long as everyone competing in a chief
    enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code is looked at under the same
    standard, fair and equitable consideration is ensured. A number of factors
    affect board scores from year to year new panel members with different thought
    processes, previous promotion eligible with changed or improved records, and a
    large pool of new eligibles. As a result, board scores do vary (often
    significantly) from one board to the next.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22195"><span id="SPAN-22196">15.50.2.5.
    Board members do not have access to the weighted scores of individuals
    competing for promotion. Their primary concern is to align all eligible in a relative
    order of merit, based on their panel score, within their chief enlisted manager
    code or Air Force specialty code. When board members leave, they do not know
    who was selected.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22197"><span id="SPAN-22198">They only know they
    have reviewed and scored each record within the standard that evolved from the
    trial run.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22199"><span id="SPAN-22200">15.50.3.<b id="B-22201">&nbsp;Not Fully Qualified Process:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22202"><span id="SPAN-22203">15.50.3.1. A
    process associated with enlisted promotion boards often misunderstood is the
    not fully qualified process. As previously stated, senior NCO evaluation board
    members use the whole-person concept to align promotion eligible in a relative
    order of merit within their chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty
    code based on the quality of each promotion eligible's senior NCO evaluation
    record. Also, board members are formally charged to ensure individuals are not
    only best qualified, but also fully qualified to assume the responsibilities of
    the next higher grade.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22204"><span id="SPAN-22205">15.50.3.2. If the
    board determines an individual is not fully qualified based on an evaluation of
    the record, the individual is rendered not fully qualified for promotion. In
    this case, Air Force Personnel Center removes the individual from promotion
    consideration and deactivates his or her promotion record, rendering the
    individual ineligible for promotion. The parent major command and military
    personnel section are then notified of the board's decision in writing. The
    parent major command must immediately notify the individual through the unit
    commander. The board is not allowed to disclose the exact rationale for their
    findings. However, factors contributing to the decision can be as general as an
    overall noncompetitive record when compared to peers or as specific as a
    demonstrated substandard performance and disciplinary problems. Additionally,
    the chief enlisted manager may have a very small number of eligibles and the
    board has exercised the authority to prevent promotion by default. In any
    event, the member is ineligible for that cycle.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22206"><span id="SPAN-22207">15.50.4.<b id="B-22208">&nbsp;Post-Board Processing.</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22209"><span id="SPAN-22210">After the board is
    finished, the weighted factor scores are combined with the board scores. This
    completely electronic operation builds an order of merit listing by total score
    within each chief enlisted manager code or Air Force specialty code, and the
    overall promotion quota is then applied to each list. After the selection
    results are approved, the data is transmitted to the military personnel
    section. Questions regarding the Master Sergeant, Senior Master Sergeant, and
    Chief Master Sergeant promotion selection process should be directed to the

    <p id="P-22454"><span id="SPAN-22455">The
    Air Force provides most civilian personnel services from two sources:
    installation civilian personnel flights, usually located in the force support squadron,
    and Air Force Personnel Center. Air Force activities collocated on an Air Force
    installation with a civilian personnel flights, or within the same locality,
    are to be served by that civilian personnel flights.&nbsp; When an activity is
    not collocated or located near a civilian personnel flights, services are to be
    provided by the nearest civilian personnel flights. Civilian Personnel Sections
    must service all civilian employees to ensure they are all included in the Air
    Force Civilian Personnel Program. Exceptions to the civilian personnel
    servicing arrangements are to be submitted to Air Force/A1C for approval due to
    impact on Reduction in Force retention and bargaining unit
    representation.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22456"><span id="SPAN-22457">This includes
    arrangements to centralize or decentralize civilian personnel servicing
    arrangements.&nbsp;<b id="B-22458">&nbsp;</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22459"><b id="B-22460"><span id="SPAN-22461">15.54. Civilian Resource Management:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-22462"><span id="SPAN-22463">15.54.1. While
    military pay is centrally managed by Headquarters United States Air Force,
    civilian pay is a budget line item at major command, field operating agency,
    and installation level, as well as at Headquarters United States Air Force. The
    availability of performance payout and numbers of authorized civilian positions
    comprise the base line for civilian employment levels. Civilian Pay funds are
    needed for civilian overtime; performance awards; special act awards; notable
    achievement awards, retention, recruitment, and relocation bonuses; student
    loan repayment program, seasonal and longerterm overhires; and voluntary
    separation incentive payments to minimize involuntary reduction-in-force
    separations and severance pay for affected employees as the result of reduction
    in force. Accurate requirement projections and development of employment plans
    are critical to support the workload demand within budget, while executing work
    years, end strength and civilian pay resource.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22464"><span id="SPAN-22465">15.54.2. Civilian
    resource management is a team effort. Commanders and senior leaders depend on
    human resource officers, financial managers, and manpower officers to recommend
    effective use of employees, funds, and manpower authorizations to meet mission
    requirements. Major commands and installations use a corporate board structure,
    meeting at least quarterly, to manage annual appropriations, revolving funds,
    or reimbursements used for civilian employment costs.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22466"><span id="SPAN-22467">15.54.3. When funds
    are available, civilian overhire positions can be established to handle peak
    workloads, recurring annual programs, military manning shortfalls, or other
    short-notice requirements that cannot be met through normal manpower
    requirements or personnel assignment processes. Most overhire positions are
    filled using temporary appointments (not to exceed 1 year). If the workload
    continues beyond a year, term appointments of up to 5 years may be used.
    Permanent appointments to overhire positions are unusual, although a permanent
    employee may be placed in an overhire position in a reduction-in-force.</span></p>

    <p id="P-22471"><span id="SPAN-22472">15.55.1. Civilian
    employees, except those above grade General Schedule-15 do not have a rank.
    Instead, they take the grade of the position they occupy. Since the position is
    graded, not the employee, detailed written job descriptions are the basis for
    determining pay, qualification requirements, performance expectations, and
    appraisal ratings.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22473"><span id="SPAN-22474">15.55.2. Position
    descriptions historically have covered duties, responsibilities, and
    supervisory controls. The Air Force has expanded the scope of core personnel
    documents to include performance standards, qualifications required for
    recruitment, and training requirements for a new employee in the position.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22475"><span id="SPAN-22476">15.55.3.
    Supervisors are responsible for core personnel documents accuracy, and for
    implementing standard core personnel documents from a growing library of these
    documents. Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC (formally AFMA/MAH) coordinates
    standard core personnel document content with appropriate Headquarters United
    States Air Force functional representatives before issuing new standard core
    personnel documents. Supervisors who select standard core personnel documents
    save the time required to write a new document and the time a position
    classification specialist would need to determine the correct pay plan or
    schedule, occupation series or code, and grade. Standard core personnel
    documents can also be used as templates for a unique core personnel documents
    that requires a new classification analysis.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22477"><span id="SPAN-22478">15.55.4. Air Force
    civilian personnel sections with relatively large numbers of serviced civilian
    personnel retain position classification authority and responsibilities until
    they transition to Air Force Personnel Center/DPIC. Air Force Personnel
    Center/DPIC performs classification support for installations with smaller
    civilian employee populations. From either source, supervisors can seek
    assistance in developing core personnel documents or selecting or modifying
    standard core personnel documents.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22479"><b id="B-22480"><span id="SPAN-22481">15.56. Filling Jobs:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-22482"><span id="SPAN-22483">15.56.1. Vacant
    civilian positions are filled based on an organization's needs using a variety
    of recruitment sources and&nbsp; appointing authorities consistent with
    applicable laws, regulations, directives and policies as established by the
    Office of Personnel Management, Department of Defense, and Department of the
    Air Force. Referral and selection priorities must be observed when filling
    competitive service positions. Employees with mandatory selection or priority
    referral rights normally include those adversely affected by reduction-in-force
    through involuntary separation or demotion. These priorities may also include
    transfer of function declinations or transfer of work outside the commuting
    area, overseas returnees, reduction-in-force reclassification, civilian
    spouses, or spouses of Regular Air Force military following a change in duty
    location. Supervisors work in concert with their servicing Human Resource
    specialist in the civilian personnel sections or Air Force Personnel Center to
    determine appropriate recruitment sources. A vacancy for competitive fill
    actions is announced, candidates are screened by Air Force Personnel Center,
    and one or more lists of candidates are referred to the supervisor.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22484"><span id="SPAN-22485">15.56.2. Based on
    their qualifying experience and/or education, civilians can enter civil service
    at different pay grade levels. The competitive staffing process used by the Air
    Force and other Federal agencies determines the relative qualifications of the
    candidates and refers only the best qualified for selection. Office of
    Personnel Management provides agencies with qualification standards written
    broadly for government-wide application. The standards are covered by either a
    Group Standard (multiple occupations) or by Individual Occupation. The Group
    Standards cover occupations under Professional and Scientific, Administrative
    and Management, Technical and Medical Support, Clerical and Administrative
    Support and Student Trainee positions. Some occupations have education
    requirements identified in the qualification standards. The level of education
    is dependent upon the duties and the grade of the position. Many jobs in
    professional and related occupations require a 4-year college degree. Some of
    these occupations including engineers, physicians and surgeons, and biological
    and physical scientists require a bachelor's or higher degree in a specific
    field of study. 5 United States Code, Section 3308 prohibits requiring
    education for positions that are competed, unless Office of Personnel
    Management has determined the duties of a scientific, technical, or
    professional position cannot be performed by an individual who does not have
    the prescribed minimum education. The minimum qualification requirements are
    listed on job announcements which may include specific job-related work
    experience, education level, medical or physical standards, training, security,
    certifications and/or licensure requirements.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22486"><span id="SPAN-22487">15.56.3.
    Competitive placements require collaboration between supervisors and human
    resource specialists at the civilian personnel sections or the Air Force
    Personnel Center. Human resource specialists advise supervisors regarding
    recruitment sources. The minimum area of consideration includes Department of
    Defense-wide, Transfer and Reinstatement eligibles for all locally and
    centrally managed permanent positions. Exceptions to the standard area of
    consideration will be limited to positions subject to the Developmental Team
    process, career broadener/intern outplacements and placements to minimize
    adverse action.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22488"><span id="SPAN-22489">15.56.4. Once
    established priority requirements are cleared, the vacancy is announced for
    competitive actions. The supervisor is issued a candidate referral list of
    qualified candidate names. Once the supervisor receives the candidate referral
    list, he or she may confer with the human resource specialist for interview
    procedures. If an interview is used as part of the selection process, the
    supervisor arranges the interview. Interviews are required for all General
    Schedule-14 and General Schedule-15 positions. Should the selecting official
    choose to interview, questions must be approved by the civilian personnel
    sections prior to use. All candidates should be asked the same questions, and
    the interview periods should be of relatively equal length. Some interview
    requirements may be defined by a locally negotiated agreement with the
    representative union.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22490"><span id="SPAN-22491">15.56.5. Centrally
    managed career programs cover most vacancies in grades General Schedule-12
    through General Schedule-15. Senior functional managers set career development
    and placement policies for employees in career program covered positions. These
    positions are subject to the same recruitment processes as non-centrally
    managed positions.</span></p>

    performance. Supervisors are responsible for determining training requirements

    <p id="P-22502"><span id="SPAN-22503">15.57.1.2. Although
    first-line supervisors are the key individuals in determining development
    needs, they may need additional guidance from higher-level management, other
    supervisors, or the employees themselves. The servicing employee development
    specialist is available to assist in training needs analysis and identification
    of methods and training sources.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22504"><span id="SPAN-22505">15.57.1.3. Not all
    training and developmental needs can or should be met through Air Force
    sponsorship. Employees are responsible for independently pursuing training and
    education that will prepare them for promotion or develop them for career
    transitions. Such self-development activity is employee initiated and
    accomplished during off-duty hours. Supervisors should encourage civilian
    employees to participate in self-development activities, when appropriate.
    Civilian tuition assistance is available in some major commands and field
    operating agencies.</span></p>

    may include on-thejob training, in-house training, and Air Force formal
    schools. On-the-job training and in-house training are often the most effective
    because the supervisor tailors the training to meet the specific job
    requirements. On-the-job training usually is as casual as giving a few pointers
    to a new worker or as formal as a fully structured training program with
    timetables and specified subjects. Therefore, on-the-job training can include
    directing employees to appropriate publications for self-study. Some functional
    activities also use in-house training. This type of training is very effective

    Employees.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22548"><span id="SPAN-22549">The employee is
    advised of the duties and responsibilities of the job and the supervisor s
    performance expectations in their core personnel document. Employees receive
    annual appraisals on how well they perform their duties. Supervisors may reward
    employees for performing their duties well. A performance award is a management
    option to recognize high performance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22550"><span id="SPAN-22551">15.58.1.1.
    Supervisors set the performance elements (duties and tasks) for the civilian
    employees they supervise. In developing an employee's performance elements,
    supervisors determine the major and important requirements of the employee s
    job based on the employee's direct contribution to organization or work unit
    objectives.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22552"><span id="SPAN-22553">15.58.1.2.
    Performance standards prescribe how a particular element or duty must be
    accomplished. Set by supervisors, the standards must reflect levels necessary
    for acceptable performance. When possible, supervisors should identify
    observable behaviors that lead to success on the job.&nbsp;<b id="B-22554">Note:</b><i id="I-22555">&nbsp;</i>Elements
    and standards are documented in writing on Air Force Form 860,&nbsp;<i id="I-22556">Civilian
    Performance Plan</i>, if a core personnel document is not used.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22557"><span id="SPAN-22558">15.58.1.3. The
    performance appraisal is the basis for personnel actions to identify and
    correct work performance problems, recognize and reward quality performance,
    improve productivity, and grant periodic pay increases. Supervisors review the
    employee's performance of each element and rate the performance against each
    element's standards and then render an overall summary rating. AFI
    36-1001,&nbsp;<i id="I-22559">Managing the Civilian Performance Program</i>, provides
    guidance for evaluating civilian employee performance for General Schedule and
    Federal Wage System employees.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22560"><span id="SPAN-22561">15.58.1.4.
    Performance awards (performance cash award, time-off award, and quality step
    increase) can be used as tools to motivate General Schedule and Federal Wage
    System employees to perform above an acceptable level as well as compensate them
    for performing beyond expectations. Effective management of the performance
    awards program can help improve productivity and morale in the organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22562"><span id="SPAN-22563">15.58.1.5. Poor
    performance must be corrected. Employees who fail one or more performance
    elements are administered an unacceptable appraisal and will have an
    opportunity to improve. Causes for poor performance are identified (medical
    conditions, training deficiencies, etc.). However, if performance does not
    improve to a satisfactory level, the employee may be removed from the position.
    Placement in another position at the same or lower grade is possible.
    Separation from civilian employment is also possible.</span></p>

    instructions. Discrimination and sexual harassment, drug and alcohol abuse,
    misuse of government purchase cards, misuse of government computers, vehicles
    and other equipment, taking bribes, conducting personal business at work, and
    criminal behavior off-duty that reflect adversely on Air Force employment are
    among the prohibited activities. The Air Force does not attempt to list all

    <p id="P-22579"><span id="SPAN-22580">15.58.3.<b id="B-22581">&nbsp;Discipline:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22582"><span id="SPAN-22583">15.58.3.1.
    Disciplinary action is taken to correct employee misconduct or performance when
    the employee can control the essentials of the performance problems and has the
    skills, knowledge, and capacity to perform well but is unwilling to do so.
    Guidance is in AFI 36-704,&nbsp;<i id="I-22584">Discipline and Adverse Actions</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22585"><span id="SPAN-22586">15.58.3.2. The Air
    Force goal in the area of civilian discipline is to maintain a constructive
    work environment. If a disciplinary or adverse action must be taken against a
    civilian employee, this action must be done without regard to race, color,
    religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or other factors (such as marital
    status or politics). Actions based on an employee's inability to perform
    because of a physical or mental disability should only be taken when the
    employee's disability cannot be reasonably accommodated.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22587"><span id="SPAN-22588">15.58.3.3. The
    employee must receive advance notice of impending actions. Disciplinary or
    adverse actions must be prompt and equitable and comply with the intent and
    letter of all governing requirements, and respect must be given to the private
    nature of the actions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22589"><span id="SPAN-22590">15.58.3.4. Proper
    administration of discipline is a chief concern of labor organizations
    representing Air Force employees. Procedures governing disciplinary and adverse
    actions are common features of most Air Force labormanagement agreements.
    Moreover, a basic tenet of federal labor relations law states that an employee
    who is a member of a bargaining unit has a right to union representation, upon
    the employee's request, during an investigatory interview where the employee
    reasonably believes disciplinary action may result from the interview.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22591"><span id="SPAN-22592">15.58.3.5. Oral
    admonishment, the least severe disciplinary action, is often adequate to
    improve work habits or correct behavior. For significant misconduct or repeated
    infractions, a written reprimand may be an appropriate penalty. Written
    reprimands are recorded in the employee personnel record for a specified
    period, as directed by AFI 36-704, or an applicable negotiated labor-management
    contract.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22593"><span id="SPAN-22594">15.58.3.6.
    Suspension is a disciplinary action that may be imposed for more serious
    infractions when the situation indicates that a lesser penalty is not adequate.
    A suspension is a particularly severe disciplinary action that places the
    employee in a nonpay and nonduty status, usually for a specific length of time.
    Employees accused of serious crime may be suspended indefinitely until criminal
    justice is complete.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22595"><span id="SPAN-22596">15.58.3.7. For
    employees who have received oral admonishments, written reprimands, or
    suspensions and whose behavior continues to be inappropriate, or for such a
    onetime egregious event of misconduct, removal may occur. Like all other
    disciplinary actions, the supervisor must ensure the disciplinary action is
    warranted and well documented. Reprimands, suspensions, and removals must be
    coordinated with the civilian personnel sections and the staff judge advocate
    so a procedural violation or an administrative oversight does not jeopardize a
    valid disciplinary action.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22597"><b id="B-22598"><span id="SPAN-22599">15.59. Working Conditions:</span></b></p>

    <p id="P-22603"><span id="SPAN-22604">15.59.1.1. Civilian
    employees are paid every 2 weeks. General Schedule employee pay is expressed as
    an annual salary and high cost areas have higher pay rates. All General
    Schedule pay rates in the United States include locality pay and pay rates
    overseas do not include locality pay and are approximately 10 percent lower
    than United States rates. General Schedule pay scales normally increase in
    January through the legislative process.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22605"><span id="SPAN-22606">15.59.1.2. The
    Federal Wage System consists of wage grade, wage leader, and wage supervisor.
    The Federal Wage System pay is expressed as hourly wage rates. Federal Wage System
    rates vary more between local areas than General Schedule. Federal Wage System
    rates may also be increased annually but on an area-by-area basis throughout
    the year.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22607"><span id="SPAN-22608">15.59.1.3. Both
    General Schedule and Federal Wage System have steps in each grade. Employees
    progress through the steps via longevity. The General Schedule grades have 10
    steps. Within grade or step increases start at 1-year intervals, but slow to
    3-year intervals in the higher steps. Federal Wage System grades have five
    steps. Federal Wage System within grade increases start at 6-month intervals
    and slow to 2-year intervals.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22609"><span id="SPAN-22610">15.59.1.4. Pay for
    overtime is at time-and-a-half or 1.5 times base pay. Overtime pay for General
    Schedule employees is capped at 1.5 times the GS-10, step 1, pay rate; for
    employees with rates of basic pay greater than the basic pay for General
    Schedule-10, step 1, the overtime hourly rate is the greater of either the
    hourly rate of basic pay for General Schedule-10, step 1, multiplied by 1.5, or
    the employee's hourly rate of basic pay. Instead of overtime pay, an employee
    may receive compensatory time off for each hour of overtime worked. Work at
    night, on Sunday, and on a federal holiday earns extra pay.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22611"><span id="SPAN-22612">15.59.2.<b id="B-22613">&nbsp;Work Hours:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22614"><span id="SPAN-22615">15.59.2.1. Civilian
    work hours are more precisely defined and less flexible than those of Regular
    Air Force military personnel. Civilian work schedules are defined in such terms
    as administrative workweek, basic workweek, regular tour of duty, uncommon tour
    of duty, and part-time tour of duty. Most civilians work a regular tour of
    duty. Normally, this is five 8-hour days, Monday through Friday. Uncommon tours
    of duty (a 40-hour basic workweek that includes Saturday and/or Sunday or fewer
    than 5 days, but not more than 6 days of a 7-day administrative workweek) are
    authorized when necessary for mission accomplishment.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22616"><span id="SPAN-22617">15.59.2.2. Special
    circumstances permit part-time, intermittent, or special tours of duty.
    Installation and tenant commanders establish, by written order, daily work
    hours to include designated rest and lunch periods. Two types of alternate work
    schedules can be implemented by organization commanders. Flexible work
    schedules allow employees to start and end work at different times. Compressed
    work schedules cover 80 hours in a pay period in fewer than 10 workdays. The
    most common schedule has four 9-hour days each week, an 8-hour day in 1 week,
    and a regular day off in the other week. AFI 36-807,&nbsp;<i id="I-22618">Weekly and Daily

    <p id="P-22622"><span id="SPAN-22623">15.59.3.1. Civilian
    employees earn 13 days of sick leave each year and 13, 20, or 26 days of annual
    leave, depending on their length of service. Annual leave accumulation is
    capped at 30 days for most General Schedule and Federal Wage System employees.
    Employees working overseas can accumulate 45 days. There is no cap on sick
    leave accumulation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22624"><span id="SPAN-22625">15.59.3.2. Annual
    leave is used for vacations and/or personal reasons and should be approved in
    advance of being taken, unless emergency conditions exist. Leave is charged and
    taken in 15-minute increments. Sick leave for medical appointments or care for
    a family member should be scheduled and approved in advance except in cases of
    emergency. Illness or injury that keeps an employee away from work should be
    reported to a supervisor during the first two hours of the duty day.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22626"><span id="SPAN-22627">15.59.3.3. Absence
    for jury duty, dismissals for extreme weather conditions, or absences excused
    by the installation commander are not charged to annual leave. Employees who have
    earned compensatory time for overtime or timeoff awards should schedule
    absences to use that time like they schedule annual leave. Absence and leave
    are covered in AFI 36-815,&nbsp;<i id="I-22628">Absence and Leave.</i></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22629"><b id="B-22630"><span id="SPAN-22631">15.60. Unions in the Air Force:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-22632"><span id="SPAN-22633">15.60.1.
    Approximately 70 percent of Air Force civilian employees are covered by labor
    agreements between unions and installations or major commands. As such, they
    are members of the bargaining unit, even if they are not dues-paying union
    members. Unions have legal status under federal law. Guidance is included in
    AFI 36-701,&nbsp;<i id="I-22634">Labor Management Relations.</i></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22635"><span id="SPAN-22636">15.60.2. A labor
    relations officer or specialist in the civilian personnel sections is the usual
    liaison between supervisors and other management officials and union officials.
    The job can be full-time or part of a larger assignment. The labor relations
    officer speaks for management in routine communications with the union and with
    parties outside the Air Force who have roles in labor contract negotiations and
    dispute resolution.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22637"><span id="SPAN-22638">15.60.3. A variety
    of union officials may act for, and make commitments for, unions. These include
    elected officers such as the president, vice president, and treasurer; and
    appointed officials such as stewards and union delegates to special meetings or
    projects. As part of a democratic organization, the union official may be
    required to present issues to a committee, such as a bargaining committee for
    approval. At other times, the official may have been delegated authority to
    make commitments. One of the duties of union officials is to raise employee
    concerns in the early stages of policy formulation and to resolve employee
    complaints. Managers should strive to work with union officials, particularly
    where grievances have been filed, in a professional, nondefensive manner.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22639"><span id="SPAN-22640">15.60.4. Management
    and union representatives negotiate collective bargaining agreements
    (contracts) covering grievance procedures, use of official time for union
    matters, use of Air Force resources by unions such as office space, telephone, and
    computers, and other local or major command-wide items of interest impacting
    the working conditions of bargaining unit employees. These contracts bind both
    sides with agreements subject to interpretation by third parties outside
    Department of Defense and Air Force; for example, the Federal Labor Relations
    Authority and/or arbitrators. Contracts do not cover pay, benefits, or other
    matters governed by Federal laws and government-wide regulations. However,
    revised Air Force instructions that differ from provisions in a contract may
    need to be negotiated. In recent years, civilian performance appraisal changes
    were not implemented at some installations until conclusion of lengthy
    negotiations between management and unions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22641"><b id="B-22642"><span id="SPAN-22643">15.61. Dispute Resolution:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-22644"><span id="SPAN-22645">15.61.1. Civilian
    employees have a variety of avenues to resolve disputes. Labor-management
    contracts must include a negotiated grievance procedure that must be used by
    members of the bargaining unit. Most start with an option to seek resolution
    using outside neutral facilitators or mediators (alternative dispute
    resolution). Formal grievances follow two or more steps before one side decides
    to refer the dispute to a paid, outside arbitrator. Costs are usually shared
    equally by the union and management, so union decisions to pursue arbitration
    are not routine. Subject to challenge on points of law or contract terms,
    arbitrators' decisions are final.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22646"><span id="SPAN-22647">15.61.2.
    Supervisors, managers, and employees who are not covered by a collective
    bargaining agreement, or who are not members of the bargaining unit follow
    different grievance procedures. AFI 36-1203,&nbsp;<i id="I-22648">Administrative Grievance
    System,</i>covers the administrative grievance process. Administrative
    grievances are decided by Air Force officials, usually the installation
    commander or designee, although outside fact finders may be used at
    management's option.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22649"><span id="SPAN-22650">15.61.3. A number
    of personnel decisions, for example, nonselection for promotion and performance
    recognition, are excluded from administrative grievances and most negotiated
    grievance procedures. Appeals of adverse actions covered by legal appeal rights
    are also excluded from the administrative grievance system. The Merit System
    Protection Board hears appeals of suspensions without pay of more than 14 days,
    demotions (change to lower grade), and removals. Disputes pursued as grievances
    cannot be duplicated as equal employment opportunity complaints and vice versa.
    Appeals of adverse actions that include allegations of discrimination may be
    reviewed by both Merit System Protection Board and the Equal Employment
    Opportunity Commission.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22651"><span id="SPAN-22652">15.61.4. A
    different route is taken to resolve union/management disputes concerning the
    statutory rights of either party. The Federal Labor Relations Authority
    investigates charges of unfair labor practice brought by either union or
    management. The union files most unfair labor practice charges when managers or
    supervisors are accused of changing working conditions or calling formal
    meetings without proper notice to the union. If found guilty, management may be
    required to revert back to the previous working condition, and the organization
    commander, including a wing commander, can be required to post an admission of
    managements wrong doing on official base bulletin boards.</span></p>

    <p id="P-22656"><span id="SPAN-22657">15.62.1. The Air
    Force mission requires military members to be prepared for service at all
    times. Force support organizations ensure Airmen's families are cared for, pay
    and entitlements are properly addressed, and their individual rights are
    secure. This chapter included information on enlisted assignments, family care,
    reenlistment and retraining opportunities, benefits and services, personnel
    records and individual rights, the awards and decorations program, and the

    the private commercial sector. This chapter also introduced civilian personnel
    management, covering such areas as job descriptions, filling positions,
    training, performance, conduct, and discipline; and working conditions, equal
    employment opportunity working conditions, and unions. Senior NCOs require a

    pay is the fundamental component of military pay and typically, the largest
    component of a member's pay. Every member is entitled to basic pay while on
    Regular Air Force, with some exceptions such as: during periods of unauthorized
    absence, excess leave, or after an enlistment expires. Annual military pay
    raises are set by Congress and the President in the National Defense
    Authorization Act. In accordance with Federal Law (37 United States Code 1009)
    the January 1 annual pay raise will automatically match the private sector wage
    increases, as measured by the Employment Cost Index for the previous year. If,
    because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the
    general welfare, the President may submit a plan to Congress requesting a lower
    annual pay raise.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-22708"><span id="SPAN-22709">16.3.1.2.<b id="B-22710">&nbsp;</b>Grade
    and length of military service determine the actual rate of basic pay. Military
    pay date is important because this date determines the length of service for
    pay purposes. In general, the pay date should be the same date the individual
    entered on Regular Air Force if he or she had no prior service before entering
    the Air Force. However, if the individual previously served in certain
    governmental agencies the Air Force adjusts the pay date to reflect credit for
    these periods. Periods of absence without leave, desertion, and sickness or
    injury due to personal misconduct will result in negative pay date adjustments.</span></p>

    <p id="P-22720"><span id="SPAN-22721">Allowances
    are monies provided for specific needs such as food or housing. Monetary
    allowances are provided when the government does not provide for that specific
    need. For example, the quantity of government housing is not sufficient to
    house all military members and their families. Those who live in government
    housing do not receive full housing allowances. Those who do not live in
    government housing receive allowances to assist with the cost of obtaining
    commercial housing. The most common allowances are basic allowance for
    subsistence and basic allowance for housing. Most members receive both of these
    allowances, and in many cases, these allowances comprise a significant portion
    of the member's total pay. Other than continental United States cost-of-living
    allowance, allowances are not taxable, which is an additional embedded benefit
    of military pay.</span></p>

    <p id="P-22725"><span id="SPAN-22726">Basic
    allowance for subsistence is a nontaxable allowance used to offset the cost of
    the service member's meals. Most junior grade enlisted members assigned to
    single-type government quarters at their permanent duty station are required to
    eat in the government dining facilities, receive basic allowance for subsistence,
    and are charged the discounted meal rate which is deducted from their pay. When
    certified by the commanding officer or designee, members are allowed to claim
    reimbursement for missed meals.</span></p>

    Allowances.&nbsp;</b>Housing allowances are based on member's grade, dependency
    status, and duty location. The location determines whether the allowance is
    basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance. In some cases,
    members who are not able to take their families to the permanent duty station
    are eligible for payment of family separation housing allowance in addition to
    basic allowance for housing or overseas housing allowance.</span></p>

    Allowance for Housing.</b>&nbsp;The intent of basic allowance for housing is to
    provide uniformed service members accurate and equitable housing compensation
    based on housing costs in local civilian housing markets. This allowance is
    payable when government quarters are not provided. Many Air Force installations
    have privatized their quarters, meaning that private contractors have taken
    over much of the previously Air Force-owned-andoperated family housing. Members
    in these privatized quarters are entitled to basic allowance for housing, and
    the rental agreement requires a rent amount not to exceed the basic allowance
    for housing entitlement paid via allotment. Members without dependents residing
    in government single-type quarters are entitled to partial basic allowance for
    housing unless the quarters (including government-leased quarters) exceed the
    minimum standards of single quarters for their grade. Members living in
    single-type government quarters who pay court-ordered child support may qualify
    for differential (basic allowance for housing-Differential). The leave and
    earning statement displays the basic allowance for housing rate below the
    heading ENTITLEMENTS, listed as basic allowance for housing. The PAY DATA

    allowance rate for each locality, grade, and dependency status. There are two

    separation allowance is a type of allowance payable to members with dependents
    in addition to any other allowance or per diem to which a member may be
    entitled. Family separation allowance has three different categories: family
    separation allowance-restricted, family separation allowance-serving on ships,
    and family separation allowance-temporary. A member may not receive more than
    one payment of family separation allowance for the same period, even though
    qualified for family separation allowance-restricted and family separation
    allowance-serving on ships or family separation allowance-temporary. The
    purpose of family separation allowance is to compensate qualified members for
    added expenses incurred because of an enforced family separation. Members are
    eligible for family separation allowance-restricted if transportation of
    dependents, including dependents acquired after effective date of orders, is
    not authorized at government expense, and the dependents do not live in the

    lodging, transportation expenses, local ground transportation, and rental car
    expenses authorized on travel orders. The cardholder, while in a travel status,
    may use the card for nonreimbursable incidental travel expenses such as rental

    automated teller machine access. Automated teller machine advances will not be
    obtained earlier than 3 working days before scheduled travel and are limited to
    authorized expenses exempt from mandatory card usage (meals, incidentals,
    miscellaneous expenses, etc.). The travel card vendor will charge the
    cardholder a transaction fee for automated teller machine use. This includes
    international transaction fees made as a result of any foreign currency
    conversion. These charges, which appear on the cardholder's billing statement,
    are typically part of the incidental expense portion of per diem and are

    Salary-offset processing. The travel card vendor may also initiate pay
    garnishment proceedings through the judicial system against cardholder accounts
    over 126 days delinquent. Upon written request of the travel card vendor,
    Department of Defense may act on their behalf and collect by payroll deduction
    from the amount of pay owed to the cardholder any funds the cardholder owes to

    collection and the Air Force would be unlikely to collect the debt. Due process
    may not apply when the collection action can be completed within two monthly

    enlisted service members. Under this provision, an enlisted service member may
    sell back up to 30 days of special leave accrual. Such a sell back counts
    toward the service member's cap of 60 days over a career. This provision has no
    termination date. Members lose any leave in excess of 60 days at the end of the
    fiscal year unless they are eligible for special leave accrual. Eligible
    members who lose leave on 1 October may have only that portion of leave

     ordinary  leave is annual leave. Normally, members request leave, as accruing
    (earning), within mission requirements. Members use annual leave to take
    vacations, attend to parental family needs such as illnesses, celebrate
    traditional national holiday periods, attend spiritual events or other
    religious observances, or as terminal leave with retirement or separation from
    Regular Air Force.</span></p>

    <p id="P-23069"><span id="SPAN-23070">Advance
    leave is leave granted based on a reasonable expectation that a member will
    accrue at least that much leave during the remaining period of active military
    service. The purpose of advance leave is to enable members to resolve
    emergencies or urgent personal situations when they have limited or no accrued
    leave. When a member has taken all the advance leave that represents what he or
    she will be accruing during the remaining period of active service, unit
    commanders change member's leave status from advance to excess leave. The financial
    service office stops or collects, if applicable, all pay and allowances paid
    after the member's leave status changes from advance to excess leave.</span></p>

    leave is an authorized absence normally for the minimal time needed to meet the
    medical needs for recuperation. Convalescent leave is not chargeable leave.
    Unit commanders normally approve convalescent leave based on recommendations by
    either the medical treatment facility authority or physician most familiar with
    the member's medical condition. When a member elects civilian medical care at
    personal expense and an Air Force physician determines the medical procedure as
    elective by military medical treatment facility authorities, such as cosmetic
    surgery, the member must use ordinary leave for all absences from duty,
    including convalescence. When medical authorities determine a medical procedure
    is necessary, such as childbirth, and the member elects civilian medical care,
    the commander, upon the recommendation by either the medical treatment facility
    authority or the attending physician most familiar with the member's medical
    condition may grant convalescent leave.</span></p>

    <p id="P-23079"><span id="SPAN-23080">Emergency
    leave is chargeable leave granted for personal or family emergencies involving
    the immediate family. Unit commanders approve emergency leave; however,
    commanders can delegate leave approval to no lower than the first sergeant for
    enlisted personnel. Normally, verification by the America Red Cross is not
    necessary. However, when the official granting leave has reason to doubt the
    validity of an emergency situation, he or she may request assistance from the
    military service activity nearest the location of the emergency or, when
    necessary, from the American Red Cross. The initial period of emergency leave
    is usually for no more than 30 days with possible extensions of an additional
    30 days. If the individual needs an extension while on emergency leave, he or
    she must contact the unit commander or first sergeant for approval. Unit
    commanders should advise members to apply for a humanitarian or exceptional
    family member reassignment or hardship discharge if the leave period is more
    than 60 days. Air Force Personnel Center approves emergency leave if leave
    requested results in a member having a cumulative negative leave balance of
    over 30 days. The member may not request emergency leave for reasons such as
    attending court hearings or the resolution of marital or financial problems;
    the member may, however, request ordinary leave for these situations.

    commander approves up to 30 days en route leave with any change of station move
    if the leave does not interfere with the reporting date to either a port or new
    assignment. Members who complete basic or technical training may request at

    supervisor. The supervisor approves or disapproves the leave and, if approved,
    sends the leave information to the unit leave monitor to validate. Once
    validated, the leave is sent electronically to finance. The member prints a

    The Air Force is a richly diverse community consisting of Airmen, military and
    civilian, with widely varied backgrounds, beliefs, multicultural influences,
    and many unique life experiences. Airmen are most effective when they are
    working in an environment that promotes teamwork, inclusion, and mutual
    respect. Therefore, we must train and prepare our Airmen to view human relation
    issues and circumstances more broadly. This will allow them to effectively
    understand, engage, and defeat any potential adversary or personal situation
    with intelligence and integrity.</span></p>

    The Equal Opportunity office will assist commanders at all levels in conducting
    a continuing campaign to eradicate every form of unlawful discrimination or

    discrimination, to include sexual harassment, the Equal Opportunity office will
    take proactive steps to ensure all available efforts are in place (for example,

    Unlawful discrimination against military members includes any unlawful action
    that denies Equal Opportunity to persons or groups based on their race, color,
    religion, national origin, sexual orientation or sex (including sexual

    Unlawful discrimination against Department of Defense civilian employees
    includes any unlawful employment practice that occurs when an employer fails or
    refuses to hire or promote, discharges, or otherwise discriminates against any
    individual with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of
    employment; or limits, segregates, or classifies employees or applicants for
    employment in any way that deprives or tends to deprive any individual of
    employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affects his/her status as an
    employee because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, (including
    sexual harassment, pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation age (40
    or older), genetic information, physical or mental disability, or reprisal.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23234"><span id="SPAN-23235">16.25.3.
    Unlawful discrimination can also include the use of disparaging terms regarding
    an individual's birthplace, ancestry, culture, or the linguistic
    characteristics common to a specific ethnic group. The use of terms that
    degrade or connote negative statements pertaining to race, color, religion,
    national origin, sex, age, genetic information, and mental or physical disability
    can constitute unlawful discrimination. These terms include insults, printed
    material, visual material, signs, symbols, posters, or insignia.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23236"><span id="SPAN-23237">16.25.4.
    The operational language of the Air Force is English. Air Force personnel must
    maintain sufficient proficiency in English to perform their official/military
    duties. All official communications must be understood by everyone who has a
    need to know their content. Commanders may require Air Force personnel to use
    English only when such use is clearly necessary and proper for the performance
    of military duties. Accordingly, commanders, supervisors, and managers at all
    levels must not require the use of English for personal communications
    unrelated to official duties.</span></p>

    perceive, the work environment as hostile or offensive. Workplace is an

    purpose of the Air Force Mishap Prevention Program is to minimize the loss of
    Air Force resources and protect Air Force people from death, injuries, or
    occupational illnesses by managing risks on- and off- duty. This program
    applies to all operations except where otherwise prescribed or specified in
    Status-of-Forces Agreements. Continuing to meet this goal is critical to our
    mission effectiveness. The challenge of deployments, technologically advanced
    combat systems, and changing duty requirements demands strong on-duty mishap
    prevention programs. Off-duty mishap prevention must also adapt to meet the
    challenges posed by motor vehicles, sports and recreation, and other off-duty
    activities. All Air Force personnel have responsibilities in the mishap
    prevention program as aligned within the Air Force Safety Management System and
    will utilize sound risk management principles, processes, tools, and techniques
    to assess and mitigate risk associated with both on- and off-duty activities.

    a decision-making process to systematically evaluate possible courses of
    action, identify risks and benefits, and determine the best course of action
    for any given situation. Risk management enables commanders, functional managers,
    supervisors, and individuals to maximize capabilities while limiting risks
    through application of a simple, systematic process appropriate for all
    personnel and functions in both on- and off-duty situations. Appropriate use of
    risk management increases an organization's and individual's ability to safely

    <p id="P-23725"><span id="SPAN-23726">16.39.1.1.<b id="B-23727">&nbsp;Accept
    No Unnecessary Risk.&nbsp;</b>Unnecessary risk comes without a commensurate
    return in terms of real benefits or available opportunities and will not
    contribute meaningfully to mission or activity accomplishment, and needlessly
    jeopardizes personnel or other assets. All Air Force missions and daily
    routines involve risk. The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are
    those that meet all mission requirements while exposing personnel and resources
    to the lowest acceptable risk; take only those risks that are necessary to accomplish
    the mission or task. However, we cannot and should not be completely risk
    averse; even high risk endeavors may be undertaken when there is a well-founded
    basis to believe that the sum of the benefits exceeds the sum of the costs.
    Balancing benefits and costs is a subjective process and tied intimately with

    Risk Decisions at the Appropriate Level.&nbsp;</b>Although anyone can make a
    risk decision that impacts their personal well-being, some risk acceptance
    decisions must be made by an appropriate decision-making authority that can
    effectively allocate resources and implement controls to mitigate or eliminate
    risks associated with an operation/activity. Making risk decisions at the
    appropriate level also establishes clear accountability. Leaders and
    individuals must be aware of how much risk they can accept and when to elevate
    risk management decisions to a higher level. Those accountable for the success
    or failure of the mission or activity must be fully engaged in the risk
    decision process.</span></p>

    risk management into planning at all levels and as early as possible. This
    provides the greatest opportunity to make well informed risk decisions and
    implement effective risk controls. To effectively apply risk management,
    commanders, supervisors, and personnel must dedicate time and resources to
    integrate risk management principles into planning, operational processes and
    day-to-day activities. Risk assessments of operations and activities are most
    successful when they are accomplished in the normal sequence of events (the
    pre-planning of a mission or activity) by individuals directly involved in the
    event, and not as a last minute or add-on process. Any amount of pre-planning
    that can be accomplished, even in a time constrained environment is better than
    no planning at all.</span></p>

    <p id="P-23740"><span id="SPAN-23741">The principles,
    goals and fundamental concepts of risk management highlight the universal
    application of risk management concepts both on- and off-duty. There are two
    primary levels of risk management (<i id="I-23742">Deliberate&nbsp;</i>and<i id="I-23743">&nbsp;Real-Time</i>)
    that dictate the level of effort and scope that should normally be undertaken
    when evaluating risk(s). Figure 16.3 depicts the basic relationship of these
    levels and how they relate across the strategic (long-term) to tactical
    (short-term) spectrums. The controls/resources and issues shown below the risk
    management levels are examples of resources and impacts that might apply across
    the planning and execution timelines. As the diagram shows, Deliberate and
    Real-Time risk management are interrelated when making risk management
    decisions; they are separated only at the point where the planning phase
    transitions to the execution phase of the mission/activity. A strong, effective
    risk management process involves careful and deliberative planning coupled with
    effective, realtime risk management. This full spectrum approach ensures
    comprehensive risk mitigation and the likelihood of mission/activity success.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23744"><span id="SPAN-23745">16.39.2.1.<b id="B-23746">&nbsp;Deliberate
    Risk Management.&nbsp;</b>Deliberate risk management refers to
    pre-mission/activity planning and involves the full formal application of the
    complete 5-Step risk management process outlined in paragraph 16.39.3. This
    process can range from an in-depth planning process involving thorough hazard
    identification, detailed data research, diagram and analysis tools, formal
    testing, and long-term tracking of the risks associated with an operation,
    activity or system, down to normal day-to-day operations/activity planning that
    utilize the same 5-Step risk management process, but require less time and
    resources to complete. Generally associated with strategic-level planning,
    in-depth risk management planning is reserved for complex operations/systems,
    high priority/high visibility situations or circumstances in which hazards are
    not well understood. In-depth risk management is normally implemented well in
    advance of the planned system, mission, event, or activity and is normally
    reserved for more complex and risky efforts (such as large troop/unit
    movements, airshow planning, system development, tactics and training curricula
    development, scheduled vacations, organized camping/hiking activities,
    scheduled home repairs, etc.). As the situation, operation, or activity becomes
    less complex, familiar and/or closer to execution, deliberate risk management
    planning becomes simplified and the focus shifts to ensuring near-term hazards
    and mitigation strategies are considered. Across the spectrum of deliberate
    risk management, we must always include the experience, expertise, and knowledge
    of experienced personnel to identify known hazards/risks and strategies to
    effectively mitigate risks for the specific mission, activity, or task in both
    on- and off-duty situations. Although pre-planning is always desired for any
    situation, we must also consider how we deal with risk management once we begin
    the execution phase of an activity.</span></p>

    level of risk management is always associated with risk management decisions
    made in  Real-Time  during the  execution  or tactical phase of training,
    operations, emergency/crisis response situations, or off-duty activities where
    there is normally little or no time to conduct formal/deliberate risk
    management planning. Real-time is usually an informal, mental risk assessment
    that is done  on the fly  (i.e. shortnotice taskings, weather/natural phenomena
    driven activities, emergency responses, spontaneous off-duty activities, etc.)
    using basic risk management process steps to identify and mitigate hazards in
    the new or changing situation. As time is normally constrained or limited in
    these situations, deliberate risk management planning is impractical.
    Imperative to the Real-Time situations, is that individuals are able to
    efficiently and effectively apply risk management concepts to mitigate risks.
    To enhance recall of critical risk management steps, the Air Force has adopted
    an easy to remember mnemonic (ABCD discussed in paragraph 16.39.4.) to assist
    personnel in making sound risk management decisions during  Real-Time  and to
    provide a description of the Air Force real-time risk management process that

    process involves application of appropriate hazard identification techniques in
    order to identify hazards associated with the operation or activity. Hazards
    can be defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission
    degradation, injury, illness, death to personnel or damage to or loss of
    equipment/property. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>

    quantitative and/or qualitative measures to determine the probability and
    severity of negative effects that may result from exposure to risks/hazards and
    directly affect mission or activity success. Assessing hazards can be a
    formalized or intuitive process. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23781"><span id="SPAN-23782">16.39.3.2.1. Assess

    Complete Risk Assessment: Combine severity and probability estimates to form a

    with severity, a matrix is created where intersecting rows and columns define a
    Risk Assessment Matrix. Figure 16.5 provides one example of a Risk Assessment
    Matrix; color coding, coupled with numeric values is one way to ensure the
    matrix is readable in both color and grayscale formats. Risk Assessment

    3) Develop Controls and Make Decisions:&nbsp;</b>Step three involves the
    development and selection of specific strategies and controls that reduce or
    eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the three
    components (Probability, Severity or Exposure) of risk. Risk mitigation decisions
    must be made at the appropriate level for the identified risk. The higher the
    risk, the higher the decision-level needs to be to ensure that an appropriate
    analysis of overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. Keep in mind
    there is no  cookie-cutter  approach or specific standard for establishing
    levels of risk management decision authority across the Air Force. Critical is
    that leadership/decision makers ensure the levels of decision authority are
    aligned appropriately for mission requirements and experience levels of the
    personnel conducting operations/activities under their responsibility. Decision
    levels may vary within a command for differing operations/activities if
    training requirements, mission sets or activities are divergent enough to
    warrant separate standards (for example, Air Education and Training Command,
    Air Force Special Operations Command, etc.). Decision makers must ultimately
    choose the most mission supportive risk controls, consistent with risk
    management principles that provide the best solution for the given hazards.
    Risk decisions must never be delegated to a lower level for convenience or when
    the situation dictates senior-level involvement; exceptions may be considered
    in time critical situations where delays might endanger lives, resources or
    equipment. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23803"><span id="SPAN-23804">16.39.3.3.1.
    Identify Control Options: Starting with the highest-risk hazards as assessed in
    Step 2, identify as many risk control options as possible for all hazards. Each
    hazard should have one or more controls that can effectively eliminate, avoid,
    or reduce the risk to an acceptable level.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23805"><span id="SPAN-23806">16.39.3.3.2.
    Determine Control Effects: Determine the effect of each control on the risk(s)
    associated with the hazard. With controls identified, the hazard should be
    re-assessed taking into consideration the effect the control will have on the
    severity and or probability. This refined risk assessment determines the
    residual risk for the hazard (assuming the implementation of selected
    controls). At this point, consider the cost (personnel, equipment, money, time,
    etc.) of the control and the possible interaction between controls; do they
    work together?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23807"><span id="SPAN-23808">16.39.3.3.3.
    Prioritize Risk Controls: For each hazard, prioritize those risk controls that
    will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The best controls will be
    consistent with mission objectives and optimize use of available resources
    (manpower, material, equipment, funding, time).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23809"><span id="SPAN-23810">16.39.3.3.4. Select
    Risk Controls: For each identified hazard, select those risk controls that will
    reduce the risk to an acceptable level. As in prioritizing controls, the best
    controls will be consistent with mission/activity objectives and optimum use of
    available resources (outlined above).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23811"><span id="SPAN-23812">16.39.3.3.5. Make
    Risk Control Decision: Analyze the level of risk for the operation/activity
    with the proposed controls in place. Determine if the benefits of the
    operation/activity now exceed the level of risk the operation/activity
    presents. Be sure to consider the cumulative risk of all the identified hazards
    and the long term consequences of the decision. If the cost of the risk(s)
    outweighs the benefits, re-examine the control options to see if any new or
    modified controls are available. If no additional controls are identified,
    inform the next level in the chain of command that, based on the evaluation,
    the risk of the mission exceeds the benefits and should be modified. When
    notified of a situation in which risk outweighs the benefit, the next level in
    the chain of command must assist and implement required controls, modify/cancel
    the mission, or accept the identified risks based on a higher level of the
    risk-benefit equation. Keep in mind that as circumstances change for a given
    mission/activity, the benefit-torisk comparison must also be made to ensure
    that previous  Go/No-Go  decisions are valid.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23813"><span id="SPAN-23814">16.39.3.4.<b id="B-23815">&nbsp;(Step
    4) Implement Controls.&nbsp;</b>Once control measures have been selected, an
    implementation strategy must be developed and carried out. The strategy must
    identify the: who, what, when, where and costs associated with the control
    measure. For mission-related controls, accountability must be emphasized across
    all levels of leadership and personnel associated with the action so that there
    is clear understanding of the risks and responsibilities of commanders and
    subordinates alike. There must always be accountability for acceptance of risk
    regardless of circumstances. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23816"><span id="SPAN-23817">16.39.3.4.1. Make
    Implementation Clear: Provide a roadmap for implementation, a vision of the end

    <p id="P-23818"><span id="SPAN-23819">16.39.3.4.2.
    Establish Accountability: Accountability is a critically important area of risk
    management. The accountable person is the one who makes the decision (approves
    the control measures), and hence, the right person (appropriate level) must
    make the decision. Also, be clear on who is responsible at the unit or
    execution level for implementation of the risk control. Individuals involved in
    a specific risk management process must be aware of who is responsible and
    accountable at each stage of an operation/activity and when (if possible)
    decisions will be elevated to the next level.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23820"><span id="SPAN-23821">16.39.3.4.3.
    Provide Support: To be successful, command/leadership must be behind the
    control measure(s) put in place. Provide the personnel and resources necessary
    to implement the control measures. Incorporate sustainability from the
    beginning and be sure to deploy the control measure along with a feedback
    mechanism that will provide information on whether the control measure is
    achieving the intended purpose.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23822"><span id="SPAN-23823">16.39.3.5.<b id="B-23824">&nbsp;(Step
    5) Supervise and Evaluate.&nbsp;</b>Risk management is a process that continues
    throughout the life cycle of a system, mission, or activity. Leaders and
    supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles to ensure
    controls are sustained over time. Key aspects of this step include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23825"><span id="SPAN-23826">16.39.3.5.1.
    Supervise: Monitor the operation/activity to ensure:</span></p>

    <p id="P-23832"><span id="SPAN-23833">16.39.3.5.1.3.
    Action is taken when necessary to correct ineffective risk controls and

    <p id="P-23834"><span id="SPAN-23835">16.39.3.5.1.4. Risk
    and controls are re-evaluated anytime the personnel, equipment, or

    <p id="P-23837"><span id="SPAN-23838">16.39.3.5.1.5. There
    is continuity of selected risk management controls during leadership changes.
    Ensuring outgoing leaders share knowledge, experiences, and lessons with

    <p id="P-23839"><span id="SPAN-23840">16.39.3.5.2.
    Evaluate: The risk management process review/evaluation must be systematic.
    After assets are expended to control risks, a cost benefit review must be
    accomplished to see if risk and cost are in balance. Significant changes in the
    system are recognized and appropriate risk management controls are reapplied as
    necessary to control the risks. Effective review/evaluation will also identify
    whether actual costs are in line with expectations and how the controls have
    affected mission performance (good or bad). Other considerations:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23841"><span id="SPAN-23842">16.39.3.5.2.1.
    Every risk analysis will unlikely be perfect the first time. When risk analyses
    contain errors of omission or commission, it is important that those errors be
    identified and corrected.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23843"><span id="SPAN-23844">16.39.3.5.2.2.
    Measurements are necessary to ensure accurate evaluations of how effectively
    controls eliminate hazards or reduce risks. When available, After-Action
    reports, surveys, and in-progress reviews are excellent tools for measurements.
    To be meaningful, measurements must quantitatively or qualitatively identify
    reductions of risk, improvements in mission success, or enhancement of
    capabilities.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23845"><span id="SPAN-23846">16.39.3.5.3.
    Feedback: A review by itself is not enough; a feedback system must be established
    to ensure that the corrective or preventative action taken was effective and
    that any newly discovered hazards identified during the mission/activity are
    analyzed and corrective action taken. Feedback informs all involved as to how
    the implementation process is working and whether or not the controls were
    effective. Feedback can be in the form of briefings, lessons learned,
    cross-tell reports, benchmarking, database reports, etc. Without this feedback
    loop, we lack the benefit of knowing if the previous forecasts were accurate,
    contained errors, or were completely incorrect. Commanders, supervisors and
    individuals must work with appropriate risk management process managers,
    Instructors/Advisors to ensure effective risk management feedback and cross tell
    is collected and distributed to enhance future operations, and activities.</span></p>

    or when the complexity or perception of overall risk is low. Effective
    assessment requires the key elements of hazard/risk identification and
    understanding the negative effects associated with those hazards/risks.
    Individuals must seriously consider the activity or action in which they are
    about to engage and choose appropriate mitigation strategies to meet the
    hazards they identify. In real-time risk management process, a complete
    assessment of the situation requires three stages of situational awareness in a
    relatively short time: (a) Perception of what is happening; (b) Integration of
    information and goals; and (c) Projection into the future. Unlike Deliberate
    risk management, where there is ample time to assess potential situations, an
    individual's ability to discern the situation and apply available resources
    quickly and effectively that can mean the difference between success or
    failure. This first step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model
    effectively combines the first two steps of the 5-Step risk management Process.</span></p>

    second step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is specifically
    tied to making risk control decisions (Step 3 of the 5-Step risk management
    process) to mitigate or eliminate the risks identified in assessing the hazards
    of the activity. After assessing the situation, personnel must consider all
    available controls (resources) to facilitate mission or activity success and
    how to manage them. Controls/resources can vary in scope and availability from
    situation to situation. The better-prepared individuals are prior to an
    activity, the more likely they will have more controls/resources available to
    create multiple redundancies or  blocks' to effectively eliminate or mitigate
    potential risks in real-time. As an example, this equates to having a good
    understanding of the situation, being properly trained, wearing correct
    personal protective equipment, knowing personal limitations, and having a
     Wingman  to support their effort. Each of these controls/resources serves as a
    layer of protection and enhances a decision maker's ability to balance risk
    versus reward through proper preparation and understanding of the situation and
    options. When making these considerations, Airmen must communicate with their
    team and leadership to ensure all options and resources are effectively
    utilized in making a sound, yet timely risk decision.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23887"><span id="SPAN-23888">16.39.4.3.<b id="B-23889">&nbsp;Communicate.&nbsp;</b>The
    third step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is to
    communicate. This communication can take various forms such as Real-Time
    communication with leadership to discuss problems and/or intentions, internal
    team/crew communication to discuss Real-Time hazards and mitigation options, or
    an individual internalizing their current situation and taking time to evaluate
    if they are heading down the right path. This step assumes individuals and/or
    teams carefully consider options and controls available to them in Real-Time
    situations, and that they are aware of how perception and communication skills
    change in unanticipated and changing environments. Perception and communication
    skills are adversely affected as individuals become increasingly stressed and
    lose situational awareness. Feeling undo pressure to succeed or to continue
    with a plan when anticipated conditions require  mid-stream  changes can have
    similar effects on individuals and/or team members as they try to compensate.
    In these high stress situations, communication skills diminish as individuals
    channelize attention and lose awareness of the overall situation; they can
    experience tunnel vision and be unable to multitask effectively to deal with
    the changing circumstances. Understanding this, individuals and teams who are
    thrust into these situations can better prepare, anticipate, and identify if
    they or others are losing situational awareness and make corrections. This
    awareness enables individuals to communicate with teammates and leadership in
    Real-Time situations, and allows them to take a step back and reevaluate
    options. Asking questions such as:  Who needs to know about the situation? 
     Who can help or assist?   Who can provide back-up?  or  Can this be done
    differently?  are just a few examples of the considerations that must be made
    prior to implementing a mitigation strategy in real-time. 16.39.4.4.<b id="B-23890">&nbsp;Decide

    <p id="P-23891"><span id="SPAN-23892">16.39.4.4.1. The
    final step of the real-time risk management process/ABCD model is to make the
    decision to continue, modify or abandon the mission/activity based upon
    Real-Time circumstances and conditions. Unlike step 4 of the 5-Step risk
    management process where an implementation strategy is carefully developed and
    carried out through identification of the who, what, when, where and cost
    associated with the control prior to an activity, realtime risk management
    process relies on the individual or small group taking immediate or near
    immediate action to mitigate risk(s) in real-time. This aspect alone can make
    real-time risk management process decisions riskier than deliberate risk
    management decisions. Individuals must realize this and make every effort to
    deliberately weigh risk decisions before taking action to ensure they are
    selecting the best course of action.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-23893"><span id="SPAN-23894">16.39.4.4.2.
    Sometimes the original plan must be modified or changed to account for
    unforeseen issues in order to assure success. Although minor changes or
    modifications to a plan or strategy may be easily implemented, others may
    require higher authority (if available) to properly weigh the risk and determine
    the best course of action. Accountability under these circumstances rests
    solely with the individual(s) involved in the activity and their responsibility
    is to fully understand the scope and limits of their Go/No-Go decision and act
    accordingly. As such, the acceptance of risk and associated consequences needs
    to be taken seriously with the understanding that any adverse outcome from a
    selected course of action may not only affect the individual, but greatly
    impact loved ones, co-workers, and ultimately their valuable contribution to
    the Air Force mission. Although the goal for any mission or activity is to
    operate safely and achieve success, all Airmen must consider the possibility of
    abandoning the mission or activity if the situation appears too risky or too
    costly to continue and there are no reasonable options or strategies to
    change/alter the circumstances in the time remaining to conduct the
    mission/activity.</span></p>

    Asking questions such as:  Was our assessment accurate?   Were we lucky?   How
    well did we use the controls/resources?   Was the communication effective?  and
     What can we do to improve the events in the future?  are a few examples of

    Dress and personal appearance standards immediately identify us as United
    States Air Force Airmen. These standards are intended to ensure all Airmen
    maintain a distinctive, plain, standardized appearance. Deeply rooted in our
    Air Force heritage our dress and personal appearance standards provide visible
    examples of self-discipline, commitment and a willingness to set aside
    individuality for the betterment of the whole. Wearing the Air Force uniform
    means carrying on a tradition that identifies the person as a member of a
    historical profession, a close-knit society, quietly assured of his or her
    competence and professionalism.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24055"><span id="SPAN-24056">17.1.2.
    The Air Force uniform developed slowly into what is worn today. During this
    evolution, the uniform design changed from one with many devices and
    accouterments to one with very few embellishments. The present Air Force
    uniform with authorized badges, insignia, and devices is plain yet distinctive,
    presenting the appearance of a military professional. Wearing the Air Force
    uniform means carrying on a tradition one that identifies the person as a
    member of a historical profession, a close-knit society, quietly assured of his
    or her competence and professionalism. This chapter identifies the most common
    uniform items and combinations for enlisted members.&nbsp;<b id="B-24057">Note:</b>&nbsp;Consult

    Air Force members in uniform will adhere to standards of neatness, cleanliness,
    safety, uniformity, military image, and present the appearance of a disciplined
    service member. Air Force members will procure and maintain all mandatory
    clothing items, follow local supplements and procedures, and keep uniforms
    neat, clean, pressed, buttoned, and properly maintained. Members will not stand
    or walk with hands in pockets of any uniform combination (other than to insert
    or remove items). While walking in uniform use of personal electronic media
    devices, including ear pieces, speaker phones or text messaging is limited to
    emergencies or when official notifications are necessary. Military customs and
    courtesies take precedence. (<b id="B-24065">Exception:</b>&nbsp;Earphones are authorized

    a uniform is optional when a member is departing from a military airfield on
    Department of Defense aircraft or United States government commercial
    contracted flights. Those who choose to wear civilian clothing will ensure
    items are neat, clean, and appropriate for inflight operations, the mode of
    travel, and the destination. Examples of inappropriate clothing include:
    ripped, torn, frayed, or patched clothing; tank tops, shorts, short skirts,
    undergarments worn as outer garment, bathing suits, and any garments which are
    revealing or display obscene, profane, or lewd words or drawings. The Airman

    <p id="P-24520"><span id="SPAN-24521">18.3.3. Muscular strength
    is the maximum force generated by a specific muscle or muscle group.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24522"><span id="SPAN-24523">18.3.4. Muscular
    endurance is the ability of a muscle group to execute repeated contractions
    over a period of sufficient time duration to cause muscular fatigue.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24524"><span id="SPAN-24525">18.3.5. Flexibility is

    refers to how hard one exercises. Moderately intense aerobic activity equates
    to continuous exercise that raises heart and respiratory rates, initiates
    sweating (varies with climate), and permits conversation; vigorously intense
    aerobic activity elicits higher physiological responses and permits light or
    broken conversation. Intensity, considered the most important variable in
    training, may be prescribed as a percentage of maximum velocity, or percentages
    of physiological variables, i.e., a percent of maximal volume of oxygen
    consumed (%VO</span><sub id="SUB-24551"><span id="SPAN-24552">2&nbsp;</span></sub><span id="SPAN-24553">max) or percent of maximal heart rate (%heart

    172 beats a minute, targeting 160 beats a minute for at least 20 minutes to 25
    minutes 3 days a week. Unfit individuals should start at the lower end of the
    heart rate Range. As fitness level increases, the resting heart rate will
    decrease, therefore increase the intensity percentage from low (50%) towards
    optimal (75%). Also, base fitness personnel can help fine tune these
    calculations taking into account medications, risk of injury, and individual
    preferences and objectives.</span></p>

    and endurance training program should include the principles of specificity,
    regularity, recovery, balance, and variety.</span></p>

    <p id="P-24608"><span id="SPAN-24609">A
    strength training program should provide resistance to specific muscle groups
    that need to be strengthened. These groups can be identified by doing a simple
    assessment of functional movement. The Airman slowly does workrelated or
    functional movements he or she wants to improve upon. An example would be the
    Airman whose job requires them to bend over, pick up an object, and place it in
    an overhead position. This work-related task has the functional movement of a
    squat and an overhead press with a weight. By incorporating these moves into a
    strength training program, the Airman can improve strength and, therefore,
    improve work-related tasks while reducing injuries by being conditioned in
    those muscles needed to perform the work. If the Airman's performance of a task
    is not adequate, or if he/she wishes to improve, strength training for the
    identified muscles will be beneficial. In this way, he/she ensures maximum
    carryover value to his/her warrior tasks.</span></p>

    <p id="P-24614"><span id="SPAN-24615">Exercise
    must be done regularly to produce a training effect. Sporadic exercise may do
    more harm than good. Airmen can maintain a moderate level of strength by doing
    proper strength workouts only once a week for a short period of time if they
    have already established a strong baseline level of muscular fitness. However,
    three workouts per week are best for optimal gains. The principle of regularity
    also applies to the exercises for individual muscle groups. An Airman can work
    out three times a week, but when different muscle groups are exercised at each
    workout, the principle of regularity is violated and gains in strength are
    minimal. Airmen should strive for exercising the same muscle group a minimum of
    twice each week.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-24616"><span id="SPAN-24617">18.5.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-24618">Principle of</b>&nbsp;<b id="B-24619">Recovery.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24620"><span id="SPAN-24621">Consecutive
    days of hard resistance training for the same muscle group can be detrimental.
    The muscles must be allowed sufficient recovery time to adapt. Strength training
    may be done every day only if the exercised muscle groups are rotated, so the
    same muscle or muscle group is not trained (exercised) on consecutive days.
    There should be at least a 48-hour recovery period between workouts for the
    same muscle groups. For example, the legs can be trained with weights on
    Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and the upper body muscles on Tuesday, Thursday,
    and Saturday. Recovery is also important within a workout. The recovery time
    between different exercises and sets depends, in part, on the intensity of the
    workout. Normally, the recovery time between sets should be 30-180
    seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-24626"><span id="SPAN-24627">When
    developing a strength training program, remember the importance of including
    exercises to work all the major muscle groups   in both the upper and lower
    body. You should not work just the muscle groups in the upper body, with the
    idea running will strengthen the legs. Most muscles are organized into opposing
    pairs; activating one muscle results in a pulling motion, while activating the
    opposing muscle results in the opposite or pushing movement. When planning a
    training session, one training technique is to follow a pushing exercise with a
    pulling exercise resulting in movement at the same joints. For example, follow
    an overhead press with a lateral pull-down exercise. This technique helps
    ensure good strength balance between opposing muscle groups which may, in turn,
    reduce the risk of injury. Sequence the program to exercise the larger muscle
    groups first, then the smaller muscles.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-24632"><span id="SPAN-24633">Using
    different equipment, changing the exercises, and altering the volume/intensity
    are good ways to add variety   and they may also produce better results. The
    Airmen should periodically substitute different exercises for given muscle
    groups. For example, Airmen can do squats with a barbell instead of leg presses
    on a weight machine. Also, for variety or due to necessity (for example, when
    in the field), they can switch to partner-resisted exercises or another form of
    resistance training. However, avoid frequent fundamental changes as Airmen may
    become frustrated if they do not have enough time to adapt or to see
    improvements in strength.</span></p>

    <p id="P-24637"><span id="SPAN-24638">18.6.1.
    Flexibility is an important component of any fitness program. Many
    activity-related injuries have their root in lack of flexibility. Think of
    muscles as rubber bands. When they are cold, they are rigid and brittle. When
    warm, they stretch and retract more easily. Conducting a good warm-up before
    exercising and a good cool down upon completion will help prevent injury and
    reduce muscle soreness.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24639"><span id="SPAN-24640">18.6.2. Regardless of
    your current fitness level, you should always begin your exercise sessions with
    a warm-up and end it with a cool down. Recommendations are listed in paragraphs
    18.8.1 and 18.8.2. below.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24641"><b id="B-24642"><span id="SPAN-24643">18.7. Body Composition.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-24644"><span id="SPAN-24645">The two largest
    contributing factors to maintaining a positive body composition are exercise
    and diet.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24646"><span id="SPAN-24647">18.7.1.
    A combination of exercise and diet is the best way to lose excessive body fat.
    Losing 1-2 pounds a week is a realistic goal best accomplished by reducing
    caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure. In other words, eat less and
    exercise more. Dieting alone can cause the body to believe the body is being starved.
    In response, the body tries to conserve its fat reserves by slowing down its
    metabolic rate and, as a result, loses at a slower rate.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24648"><span id="SPAN-24649">18.7.2.
    Airmen must consume a minimum number of calories from all the major food
    groups, with the calories distributed over all the daily meals   including
    snacks and drinks. This ensures an adequate consumption of necessary vitamins
    and minerals. A male, not under medical supervision, requires a caloric intake
    of at least 1,500; women require at least 1,200 calories and Airmen should
    avoid diets failing to meet these criteria.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24650"><span id="SPAN-24651">18.7.3. There is no
     quick and easy  way to improve body composition. Losing fat safely takes time
    and patience.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24652"><span id="SPAN-24653">18.7.4.
    Exercise not only burn calories, but helps the body maintain its useful muscle
    mass and may help keep the body's metabolic rate high during dieting. Fat is
    best utilized during aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise, which uses lots of
    oxygen, is the best type of activity for burning fat. Aerobic exercise includes
    jogging, walking, swimming, bicycling, cross-country skiing, rowing, stair
    climbing, and jumping rope. Anaerobic activities, such as sprinting or lifting
    heavy weights, burn little, if any, fat.</span></p>

    <p id="P-24657"><span id="SPAN-24658">18.8.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-24659">The Warm-up.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24660"><span id="SPAN-24661">Before
    beginning any vigorous physical activity, you should prepare your body for
    exercise. The dynamic warmup increases the flow of blood to the muscles and
    tendons, thus helping reduce the risk of injury and increasing the joint s
    range of motion and positively affects the speed of muscular contraction. The
    following is the recommended sequence of dynamic warm-up activities for 5-7
    minutes before vigorous exercise:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24662"><span id="SPAN-24663">18.8.1.1. Slowly jog in
    place or walk for 1-2 minutes. This causes a gradual increase in the heart
    rate, blood pressure, circulation, and increases the temperature of the active
    muscles.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24664"><span id="SPAN-24665">18.8.1.2. Slowly rotate
    joints (for example, arm circles, knee and ankle rotations) to gradually
    increase their range of motion; work each major joint for 5-10 seconds.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24666"><span id="SPAN-24667">18.8.1.3. Slowly mimic
    the activities to be performed. For example, lift a lighter weight to warm up
    before lifting the heavier one; this helps prepare the neuromuscular pathways.
    The dynamic warm-up increases the flow of blood to the muscles and tendons,
    helping reduce the risk of injury, increasing the joint's range of motion, and
    positively affects the speed of muscular contraction.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24668"><span id="SPAN-24669">18.8.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-24670">Cool Down.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24671"><span id="SPAN-24672">18.8.2.1.
    Do not stop suddenly after vigorous exercise, but gradually bring your body
    back to a resting state by slowly decreasing the intensity of the activity.
    After running, for example, you should walk for 1-2 minutes. Stopping exercise
    suddenly can cause blood to pool in the muscles, thereby reducing blood flow to
    the heart and brain. This may cause fainting or abnormal heart rhythm and this
    could lead to serious complications.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24673"><span id="SPAN-24674">18.8.2.2.
    Repeat the stretches done in your warm-up to help ease muscle tension and any
    immediate feeling of muscle soreness; be careful not to  over-stretch . The muscles
    are warm from activity and could be over-stretched to the point of injury.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24675"><span id="SPAN-24676">18.8.2.3. Hold stretches
    15-30 seconds or more during your cool down to improve flexibility.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24677"><span id="SPAN-24678">18.8.2.4.
    Do not limit flexibility training to the cool down periods. Stretching is one
    form of exercise that takes very little time relative to the benefits gained
    and may be done easily at home or work. Repetitive movements at work or having
    a more sedentary job can increase tension in specific muscle groups, which
    would benefit from mild stretching during the course of the day.</span></p>

    The Air Force uses a composite fitness score based on aerobic fitness, muscular
    strength/endurance, and body composition (using abdominal circumference
    measurements) to determine overall fitness. Overall fitness is directly related
    to health risk, including risk of disease (morbidity) and death (mortality). A
    composite score of 75 or greater, in addition to meeting the minimum component
    scores, represents the minimum accepted for health, fitness, and readiness
    levels. Health and readiness benefits continue to increase as body composition
    improves and physical activity and fitness levels increase. Members are
    encouraged to optimize their readiness status and posture by improving their
    overall fitness. Age and gender-specific fitness score charts are provided in
    AFI 36-2905, Attachment 10.&nbsp;<b id="B-24694">Note:</b>&nbsp;Meeting the minimum
    component scores does not constitute the minimum points required to earn a

    Airmen s' health and readiness. The Air Force recognizes abdominal circumference
    as one of the most specific indicators of disease risk in adults because
    abdominal fat is a predictor of obesity-related diseases. In addition to
    meeting military appearance standards, overweight and obese Airmen have
    increased risk of high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, heart disease,
    stroke, Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, breathing problems and certain types of
    cancer. Gradual improvements in diet, physical activity and lifestyle are
    easier to incorporate and more likely to be maintained. This can be achieved by
    following the key dietary guideline recommendations to consume a healthy eating
    pattern that accounts for all foods and beverages within an appropriate calorie
    level. A healthy eating pattern includes: a variety of vegetables from all the
    subgroups- dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy, and
    other; fruits, especially whole fruits; grains, at least half of which are
    whole grains; fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or

    <p id="P-24954"><span id="SPAN-24955">18.15.2.4.1.1.
    Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source your body uses during exercise. An
    appropriate amount of carbohydrates is important to maintain glycogen stores
    for energy reserve. Carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels and supply energy.
    Simple carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels rapidly while complex
    carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels slowly over a longer time. Simple
    carbohydrates are often found in packaged or processed foods, examples are;
    table sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, honey, fruit drinks, soft drinks and
    candy. Added sugars are simple sugars added to foods or beverages when they are
    processed or prepared and should account for less than 10% of calories per day.
    Complex carbohydrates can be found in fruits, breads, cereals, grains, milk and
    starchy vegetables (potatoes, corn, peas, and squash). Healthy carbohydrates
    contain fiber and whole grains and limited added sugars. The recommended
    serving size is about the size of the palm of your hand and contains
    approximately 15 grams of carbohydrate; sizes differ with sweets and
    vegetables. The general recommendation for carbohydrate intake is 45-65% of
    total calories.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24956"><span id="SPAN-24957">18.15.2.4.1.2.
    Fiber is classified as soluble or insoluble. Soluble fiber attracts water and turns
    to gel during digestion. Therefore, soluble fiber lowers low-density
    lipoprotein/bad cholesterol and prolongs stomach emptying time so sugar is
    released and absorbed more slowly. Additionally, fiber can be found in oatmeal,
    oat bran, nuts and seeds, dry beans and peas, and most fruits. Insoluble fiber
    adds bulk to the stool and helps food pass more quickly through the stomach and
    intestines. Finally, fiber can be found in whole wheat bread, barley, brown
    rice, seeds, and in most vegetables and fruits. The average American consumes
    12-15 grams per day, whereas the recommended total fiber intake is 20-35 grams
    per day.</span></p>

    <p id="P-24961"><span id="SPAN-24962">Proteins
    are used by our bodies for tissue maintenance, replacement, function and growth
    of our muscles. If our body is not getting enough calories from dietary sources
    or tissue stores, protein may be used for energy. The general recommendation
    for protein intake is 10-35% of total calories or 0.8 to 1.2 grams/kilograms
    body weight to meet daily needs. Protein can be found in meats, poultry, fish,
    legumes, tofu, eggs, nuts and seeds, milk and milk products, and grains.
    Individuals should focus on lean meats and low fat milk products to reduce
    saturated fats. The recommended serving size of meat is the size of a deck of
    cards and contains about 21 grams of protein. One 8 ounce glass of milk
    contains 8 grams of protein.&nbsp;</span></p>

    reserve. Fats can be found in oils, high fat cuts of meat, baked sweets,
    whole-fat milk and cream, butter, cheeses, nuts and seeds, avocados, and fish.
    The general recommendation for fats is 20-35% of total calories. The

    high-fat cheeses, high-fat cuts of meat, whole-fat milk and cream, butter, ice
    cream, and palm and coconut oils.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-24972"><span id="SPAN-24973">18.15.2.4.3.
    Trans fats have also been linked to coronary heart disease and intake of these

    the fatty parts of meat and milk products and in foods that contain partially
    hydrogenated oils. Trans fats can be made from vegetable oils through a process

    <p id="P-24981"><span id="SPAN-24982">Americans
    consume about 3,400 milligrams of sodium every day, mostly in the form of salt
    found in processed foods- canned foods, soups, cheese, bread, prepared mixes
    and deli meats. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults
    limit their sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day-about the amount in one teaspoon
    of table salt. Certain  at-risk  groups including adults over the age of 51,
    African Americans, and people who have high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney
    disease should limit their sodium intake to about 1,500 milligrams per day.
    High sodium intake raises blood pressure which is a major risk factor for the
    nation's leading cause of death   heart disease. The best way to ensure a low
    sodium diet is to eat whole foods such as fresh or frozen fruits and
    vegetables; lean, unprocessed poultry and fish; unsalted nuts; whole grains; and
    low-fat dairy products such as skim milk or yogurt.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-24986"><span id="SPAN-24987">Water is essential for
    life, in fact the body is made up of over 60% water. Water has no calories and
    is needed to transport nutrients throughout your body via blood plasma, while
    also assisting many of your body's other functions, including waste
    elimination. Depending on age, sex, race, and body composition water needs
    differ. The exact percentage is different for males and females and from one
    person to another with a range of 45-75%. Taking these factors into account,
    daily water balance for each individual also depends on the total difference
    between water gain and water loss. Water gains occur from consumption of
    liquids, foods, and the body's natural production of water. Water losses occur
    from the following sources: sweat, respiration, gastrointestinal, and renal.
    The body is in constant demand for water and this demand increases when you
    exercise, when you are ill, and in environmental conditions, such as humidity
    and altitude. For a generally healthy individual, the Dietary Reference
    Intakes, recommend a total daily water consumption (combination of drinking
    water, beverages, and food) for women, 19-70 years of age, as 2.7 liters per

    is a stimulant present in a variety of products including coffee, tea, colas,

    foods. According to the Human Performance Resource Center, daily caffeine
    intake up to 400 mg has been found safe for healthy adults and
    non-pregnant/non-lactating women. Caffeine used in moderation with a dose of up
    to 200 mg has been shown to improve cognitive performance in individuals. A cup
    of coffee typically has 100 mg of caffeine. Be aware that taking large doses of
    caffeine, roughly 400 500 mg, at one time can result in a serious condition
    known as  caffeine intoxication.  Symptoms of caffeine intoxication can include
    nausea, vomiting, agitation, nervousness, or headache. Excessive caffeine
    intake can be life-threatening and could potentially cause electrolyte
    imbalance or high levels of acid in the blood which could cause seizures.</span></p>

    drinks and sports drinks are both marketed by manufacturers to improve
    performance. Evidence as to the effect of energy drinks on athletic performance
    is inconsistent. Be aware, case studies have reported seizures after heavy
    consumption of energy drinks. Energy drinks usually carry a  warning  due to
    the use of stimulants such as caffeine, green tea extract, guarana seed
    extract, yerba mate, acacia rigidula, taurine, ginseng or other proprietary
     energy boost blends.  Proprietary blends can contain novel, untested
    ingredients, along with botanicals, amino acids, proteins, peptides, or
    extracts. Additionally, vitamins and minerals (e.g. B-vitamins and magnesium)
    may be added, leading to excessive intakes. Energy drinks are not meant to
    hydrate. Sports drinks, or carbohydrateelectrolyte beverages, are designed to
    hydrate and do not contain caffeine unless otherwise stated. Sports drinks
    generally contain a mixture of carbohydrates (14 to 19 grams per 8-ounce
    serving), sodium (115-175 mg per 8ounce serving), and potassium (20-98
    milligrams per 8-ounce serving) which has been shown to improve exercise
    performance. If eight liters of sweat are lost per day or higher intensity
    exercise lasts greater than 60 minutes, a carbohydrate-electrolyte beverage may
    be needed. In conclusion, the safest solution is to avoid energy supplements

    drinking can be harmful to your health and may increase the risk for high blood
    pressure, liver cirrhosis and several forms of cancer. The Dietary Guidelines
    for Americans advise limiting alcohol to one drink per day for women and two
    drinks per day for men. The serving size for beer is 12 ounces, wine is 5
    ounces and 80 proof distilled spirits is 1.5 ounces. The average serving of
    alcohol generally has about 150 calories. Additionally, alcohol has 7 calories
    per gram and can be a significant contributor caloric consumption in the diet.
    Alcohol may lead to excess weight gain, increased risk for chronic diseases,

    <p id="P-25008"><span id="SPAN-25009">Nutrition
    plays an important role in maintaining health and performance, particularly
    exercise. This next section builds upon the basic nutrition principles and
    focuses on fueling strategies that will help enhance and optimize physical
    performance. The basics of performance nutrition focus on fluid hydration and
    timing of fueling strategies (before, during, and after
    exercise).&nbsp;<b id="B-25010">&nbsp;</b></span></p>

    Requirements with Exercise.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25015"><span id="SPAN-25016">Exercise
    substantially increases fluid loss, placing greater demands on fluid replacement;
    so that proper hydration before, during, and after intense workouts is
    critical. Decrements in performance starts to occur with fluid losses of 2% of
    body weight degrades both cognitive and mental performance. One liter of water
    is equivalent to 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. An example would be a
    150 pound individual losing 3 pounds of body weight through sweat losses which
    would equate to 1.36 liters of fluid. During exercise, sweat rate losses can
    vary from 0.3-2.4 liters. Fluid losses are dependent on exercise intensity,
    genetic predisposition, fitness status, acclimation of heat, altitude,
    clothing, and other environmental conditions. Dehydration occurs with fluid
    losses of greater than 2% of body weight and increases risk for heat illness,
    exhaustion and stroke. In general, for activities less than 60 minutes, water
    is the best beverage for hydration. If you are doing more than 60 minutes of
    continuous exercise, then you may benefit from a sports drink to replace
    electrolytes and carbohydrates. Also know that a while dehydration can affect
    performance and be life threatening, the same can occur on the opposite end of
    the spectrum with excess fluid consumption. Excess fluid can lead to
    over-hydration resulting in symptoms such as chills, vomiting, dizziness,
    disorientation, altered mental status, fatigue, headache, and even death.
    According to the United States Army Research Institute of Environmental
    Medicine, regardless of how hot it is or how hard you are working, you should
    limit fluids to no more than 6 cups an hour and 48 cups a day. The key with
    fluid intake is to aim to replace losses and monitor signs and symptoms of
    under/over hydration. Determine how much water is lost by taking a weight
    measurement (without clothes/gear) before and after a hard training workout.
    Drink 16 ounces of fluid for every pound of weight lost.</span></p>

    purpose of a pre-exercise beverage, snack or meal is to provide enough fluid to
    maintain hydration and enough carbohydrates to maintain proper blood sugar
    levels during activity. A pre-exercise meal (includes some carbs, protein and
    low or moderate fat) should be consumed 3 to 4 hours before starting the
    activity. This allows time for the body to digest the food. A small amount of
    protein before exercise may reduce muscle soreness later. Pre-exercise
    snacks/beverages should be consumed 30 to 60 minutes before an activity. The
    snacks and beverages consumed one hour before should contain mainly
    carbohydrates since they are digested quickly and turned to energy-giving
    glucose. Snack examples are bananas or other fruits (grapes, applesauce, and
    peaches), graham crackers, pretzels, or low fiber dry cereal. Avoid foods with fat
    and fiber in a pre-exercise snack to minimize possibility of an upset stomach.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25026"><span id="SPAN-25027">18.15.3.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-25028">During
    Exercise:&nbsp;</b>During exercise duration of less than 45 minutes,
    carbohydrate consumption is not warranted. In sustained high intensity exercise
    with a duration of 45-75 minutes, small amounts of carbohydrates during
    activity (sports drinks and products) may enhance performance, but does not
    provide a source of fuel. During endurance exercise of 1-2.5 hours in length,
    carbohydrate intake provides a source of fuel. The recommended intake of
    carbohydrates for events 1-2.5 hours in length is 30-60 grams per hour. In
    ultra-endurance events, greater than 2.5-3 hours in length, carbohydrate
    intakes of up to 90 grams per hour can improve performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25029"><span id="SPAN-25030">18.15.3.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-25031">Post-exercise/Recovery:&nbsp;</b>If
    exercising at a low or moderate intensity for less than a half hour a post
    workout beverage or snack is not necessary. However, if the exercise routine is
    rigorous and lasts for more than 45 minutes, a snack or light meal will help in
    recovery. This  recovery  meal helps replenish the carbohydrates burned during
    exercise and converts them into a storage form (glycogen) for later use. Adding
    protein to the meal or snack helps rebuild muscle tears that occur during
    exercise. Following exhaustive exercise a minimum of 24 hours is required to
    replace the glycogen stores lost in training. Timing and the ratio of
    carbohydrate to protein are also important factors to consider. The critical
    window of refueling is within 45 minutes of finishing your exercise. High
    glycemic foods are the most effective for restoring glycogen. An optimal
    composition of a post recovery beverage or snack is a 4:1 carbohydrate to
    protein ratio. This means that for every 4 grams of carbohydrates there should
    be 1 gram of protein. A great example is the recovery beverage chocolate milk.
    A regular 8 ounce glass of chocolate milk contains about 29 grams of
    carbohydrates and 8 grams of protein, a 3.6:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. In
    contrast, a regular 8 ounce glass of milk contains 12 grams of carbohydrates
    and 8 grams of protein, a 1.5:1 carbohydrate/protein ratio. Other examples of
    simple post-workout snacks include low fat yogurt, trail mix (cereal, nuts and
    dried fruit) and water, or string cheese and a fruit bar with water. Hydration
    repletion should also be a priority. Recovery fluids should include sodium and
    potassium. Examples of these types of fluids are: water, juices, sports
    beverages, coffee, tea, soups, and water containing foods such as fruits and
    vegetables.</span></p>

    The use of dietary supplements continues to be popular among members of the
    military. The term dietary supplement includes many products, such as vitamins,
    minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, or other substances, and are sold as
    pills, powders, bars, packs, gels, drinks, or shakes. The Food and Drug
    Administration does not test products before they are sold in stores or via the
    internet; this lack of oversight means there is no guarantee that what you
    purchase is what you get. Knowing the  red flags' when choosing a dietary
    supplement is important. First, be aware that the most popular types of
    supplements- bodybuilding, performance enhancement, sexual enhancement, and
    weight loss products, are the ones most likely to be  tainted  with
    prescription drugs, heavy metals, or other undeclared ingredients. Second,
    avoid products that have ingredients listed as  blends,   proprietary blends, 
    or  delivery systems' on the label. These blends do not specify the amount of
    each ingredient in the blend and increase the risk of overdosing on ingredients
    such as creatine or caffeine. Third, be wary of products that promise a  quick
    fix  or amazing results that seem too good to be true. Fortunately, there are
    third party verification/certification companies that will test the purity
    and/or quality of the product, so look for those types of labels on your
    products (Figure 18.3). Remember, climate and stress may alter the effects of
    dietary supplements, especially in a deployed environment which can increase
    the risk of having a bad reaction to a product.</span></p>

    Tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of disease and death in the

    about 1 in 5 deaths (at least 480,000 deaths per year, of which an estimated

    <p id="P-25282"><span id="SPAN-25283">18.28.1. Optimal health
    and total fitness are force multipliers and critical to the military mission.
    Tobacco use, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, spit tobacco
    (also known as smokeless tobacco or  chew ), and electronic cigarettes
    (e-cigarettes), is inconsistent with the Air Force's goal of a mission-ready,
    healthy and fit force. Tobacco use affects all bodily systems, not just the
    mouth and lungs. Some types of cancer, cardiovascular diseases and many types
    of other diseases, have been linked to tobacco use. For the military member,
    tobacco use decreases endurance, night vision and fine motor coordination (for
    example, the coordination needed to hold a weapon steady), increases the risk
    of injuries (such as fractures) and post-operative respiratory complications,
    and impairs (or slows) wound healing. Additionally, the Environmental
    Protection Agency classifies tobacco smoke as a class  A  carcinogen. This
    means smoking causes cancer. Smoking is an obvious cancer threat to the smoker;
    but, more importantly, it poses a cancer threat to the individual who chooses
    not to smoke. Tobacco not only harms the user but can also cause cancer or
    contribute to cardiovascular disease in those who breathe the exhaled smoke
    called environmental tobacco smoke.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25284"><span id="SPAN-25285">18.28.2.
    While studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
    National Institutes of Health have shown a decline in cigarette smoking, the
    use of other forms of tobacco has significantly increased. The increased use of
    smokeless tobacco is based on the faulty assumption of less hazardous.
    Smokeless tobacco actually contains 28 different cancercausing agents
    (carcinogens). Oral cancers affect 30,000 people annually, and one person dies
    every hour as a result of this disease. The 5-year survival rate is very low.
    Only 50 percent of persons are alive at 5 years after diagnosis.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25286"><span id="SPAN-25287">18.28.3. Nicotine found
    in tobacco products is addictive. Nearly one-half of all smokers in the United
    States have tried to quit in the past year. Because of the powerful physical
    and psychological addiction, quitting can be a challenge. The longer one uses
    tobacco, the more difficult cessation can be. Therefore, never using products
    containing nicotine is the best prevention. The United States Surgeon General
    has found that nearly 100 percent of adults who smoke every day started smoking
    when they were 26 years of age or younger, reinforcing prevention in our
    younger Airmen is critical to reducing tobacco prevalence in the Air Force.</span></p>

    TRICARE has estimated that tobacco use costs the Department of Defense $1.7

    families do not pay enrollment fees, annual deductibles, or copays for care,
    unless they seek care in the network without a primary care manager referral.
    Each Prime enrollee is assigned a primary care manager who is responsible for
    providing routine, non-emergency, and urgent health care. The primary care
    manager is responsible for submitting referrals for specialty care and
    establishing medical necessity when needed. The primary care manager also
    coordinates with the regional TRICARE contractor, when necessary, to find
    specialists in the network. TRICARE Prime also has time and distance standards
    for urgent, routine, and specialty care to ensure beneficiaries can
    conveniently access care when the care is needed. Other Prime benefits include
    travel reimbursement for some specialty care, and a point-of-service option
    that permits enrollees to seek care from any provider without a referral;
    however, the point-of-service option carries significantly higher deductibles
    and cost shares then those under TRICARE Standard. TRICARE Prime is the only

    visit any TRICARE-authorized provider within the network or outside the

    space-available basis only. Referrals for health care are not needed under
    these two health plans, but some services may require prior authorization. The
    network status of the provider being seen determines whether the beneficiary
    will be charged copays under TRICARE Standard or TRICARE Extra. When visiting a

    apply. When visiting a network provider, the Extra option is being used and the
    beneficiary will pay less out of pocket as compared to non-network providers.

    roughly 40,000 Americans die by suicide, almost twice as many as are killed by
    homicide. The military is not exempt from the problem of suicide. Suicide
    remains a leading cause of concern and preventable form of death among Air
    Force personnel. During the last five years (2011 - 2015) the Air Force lost
    between 43- 63 Airmen per year to death by suicide. This equates to 12.9 to
    20.3 suicides for every 100,000 Airmen. The Air National Guard and Air Force
    Reserve components have lost an average of 25 Airmen per year. Additionally,
    the Air Force has lost an average of 18 civilian employees to death by suicide
    over the last five years. Within the Air Force, the most common stressors
    experienced by those who die by suicide are relationship problems, legal
    problems, mental health problems, financial hardship and work problems. Air
    Force data shows that while all age, rank, gender and ethnic groups are
    represented suicide is most common amongst young, junior enlisted Caucasian
    males.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25436"><span id="SPAN-25437">18.41.1. The reasons for
    considering suicide will vary from person to person. All people experience
    stressors (i.e., challenges or problems) and distress (i.e., the negative
    feelings associated with stressors). Research tends to identify that risk for
    suicide is associated with feeling isolated/not belonging, the belief that the
    individual is or will become a burden and an acquired capability both in access
    to a means to die and overcoming the fear of dying. Other factors associated
    with suicide are new or worsening stressors/distress combined with an inability
    to problem solve/cope. The Air Force promotes and supports Airmen who resolve
    their problems and challenges in healthy, safe, and constructive ways. To that
    end, the Air Force has developed many resources to help Airmen and their
    families resolve these problems.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25438"><span id="SPAN-25439">18.48.2.
    Airmen must know the importance of recognizing that anyone can become suicidal,
    regardless of how well they have managed military or personal stress
    previously. If an Airman experiences stressors or problems that overwhelm their
    ability to cope, it may result in feeling distressed, alone, and a burden to
    others. This may increase vulnerability and susceptibility to suicide.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25552"><span id="SPAN-25553">18.43.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-25554">Legal
    Problems.</b>&nbsp;Being under investigation for a suspected criminal offense
    is extremely stressful. Legal problems almost always entail some type of career
    impact and can be cause for administrative action by the Air Force. Military
    members who face serious legal problems often worry about public disgrace, a
    very real threat to their careers, their freedom, or their ability to find work
    if separated from the Air Force. While criminal charges carry realistic
    consequences, some individuals may begin thinking of the worst possible outcome
    whether realistic or not. This increased stress (real or perceived) is why they
    need more support from their command, unit, and Air Force community regardless
    of the crime for which they have been investigated/charged/convicted.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25555"><span id="SPAN-25556">18.43.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-25557">Financial
    Problems.&nbsp;</b>Financial problems can be a stressor and a cause of
    distress. Alert commanders often recognize this as symptomatic of a possible
    broader pattern of problems or poor decision-making. Financial problems can
    also be a symptom of other problems such as gambling or substance
    misuse/addiction.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25558"><span id="SPAN-25559">18.43.3.<b id="B-25560">&nbsp;Relationship
    Problems.&nbsp;</b>Relationship problems are the most common stressor type
    among Air Force members who have died by suicide. An abrupt loss, like a break
    up in a romantic relationship is a frequently seen stressor. A healthy, happy
    and supportive relationship can be an important protective factor against many
    other kinds of stress. When relationships are troubled they may add to personal
    stress/distress and/or make other stressors more challenging to manage.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25561"><span id="SPAN-25562">18.43.4.<b id="B-25563">&nbsp;Work
    and Administrative Problems.&nbsp;</b>Work and administrative problems (e.g.,
    failure to complete tasks, poor performance or showing up to work late) have
    been noted in many Air Force suicides. These work related stressors may be a
    sign of other problems (e.g., alcohol or relationship problems) and/or they may
    influence or increase feelings of hopelessness and isolation. Feelings of hopelessness
    and isolation increase vulnerability and susceptibility to suicide. An Airman
    facing administrative problems like fitness testing failures may feel his
    career and future are at risk. Airmen must be able to identify and understand
    the seriousness of workplace or administrative problems. Front line leaders and
    fellow Airmen should understand the challenges that an Airman may be
    experiencing and act to provide support.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25564"><span id="SPAN-25565">18.43.5.<b id="B-25566">&nbsp;Mental
    Health Problems.&nbsp;</b>Studies in non-military populations have tended to
    show that up to 90% of individuals dying from suicide have evidence of past
    mental health problems. This has led to the assumption that mental health
    problems lead to suicide. While many individuals who die by suicide have a
    mental health history the majority of individuals with a mental health history
    will not attempt or die by suicide. Mental health problems are common among
    Airmen who die by suicide. Despite the difficulty to fully quantify mental
    health problems among Airmen who die by suicide, since Airmen may avoid seeking
    mental health care and/or may under-report their symptoms. Most mental health
    problems treated in the Air Force are not severe and many mental health visits
    are related to difficulties with life stresses rather than a serious mental
    illness. However, individuals with significant mental illness are at increased
    risk of suicide. Therefore, Airmen with symptoms of a mental illness must
    understand the importance of seeking help early and complying with their
    treatment plans. Effective treatments for mental illness are available and can
    reduce risk of suicide.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25567"><b id="B-25568"><span id="SPAN-25569">18.44. Facts about Air Force Suicides.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-25570"><span id="SPAN-25571">18.44.1.<b id="B-25572">&nbsp;Planned
    versus Unplanned.&nbsp;</b>Suicides may be unplanned (impulsive) or planned. In
    unplanned suicides, there may be little or no warning. These may be very
    difficult to predict or prevent and can be associated with excessive use of
    alcohol or other substances. In planned suicides, an individual may take the
    time to plan out the aspects of their death, like updating a will or checking on
    life insurance. While these are normal activities for most adults to undertake,
    a pattern of behavior in an Airman that indicates he is  putting his affairs in
    order  may indicate consideration of suicide. There are often some indicators
    in either planned or unplanned suicides that can be detected. See the list of
    risk factors to identify potential changes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25573"><span id="SPAN-25574">18.44.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-25575">Communication
    of Intent.&nbsp;</b>Not every Airman who dies by suicide will communicate their
    intention to end their life. Some may make suicidal statements (e.g., stating
    that others would be better off without them), or send texts, use voicemails,
    social media posts or leave a note. Sometimes suicidal individuals talk about
    themes of death and suicide, without referring to themselves. In other cases, the
    deceased may not communicate their intent at all. The increase in the use of
    electronic communications presents another medium for people to communicate
    suicidal thoughts or intentions as well as new opportunities for alert Airmen
    to intervene. Any suicidal remark should be taken very seriously and followed
    up on. Some people are reluctant to ask a person whether they are having
    thoughts of suicide because of the fear that they will give someone the idea.
    Substantial research indicates that this is not the case. The opposite is true:
    asking a person if they are having thoughts of suicide may prevent a suicide by
    getting the person the care they need.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25576"><span id="SPAN-25577">18.44.3.<b id="B-25578">&nbsp;Time of
    Year versus Unpredictable Variability.</b>&nbsp;Statistically, suicide is a
    rare occurrence. Because of the infrequent, suicide rates in small populations
    (e.g. a major command) vary quite randomly. This often leads people to try to
    find factors like time of year to explain rises and dips in rate. One such myth
    is that suicide is more common during the holidays when people may feel more
    alone and isolated. This is not true. Personal factors like the ones described
    above are much more important. Vigilance must be maintained year round.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25579"><span id="SPAN-25580">18.44.4.<b id="B-25581">&nbsp;Changes
    in Behavior versus no Change in Behavior.&nbsp;</b>A common myth is that once
    an Airman has made the decision to die by suicide, they may appear calm, as if
    all their problems have been resolved. This may be true for some, but not all.
    Airmen need to be observant for any sudden changes in behavior or attitude in
    their fellow Airman. These changes should be attended to in a supportive manner
    to ensure the individual is not considering suicide.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25582"><b id="B-25583"><span id="SPAN-25584">18.45. Self-injurious Behavior and Suicide
    Attempts.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-25585"><span id="SPAN-25586">Self-injurious
    behavior (i.e., cutting, burning) is any behavior that intentionally causes
    harm to the individual regardless of the severity of the injury. A suicide
    attempt is any behavior whose intent is to end the individual's life,
    regardless of the outcome. Any self-injury or suicide attempt should be treated
    as serious as the severity of injury is not an accurate indicator of the
    person's potential risk or intent. These injuries warrant immediate medical and
    command attention and should be addressed and reported without delay.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25587"><b id="B-25588"><span id="SPAN-25589">18.46. Every Airman's Responsibilities.</span></b></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-25590"><span id="SPAN-25591">In the Air Force, each
    Airman has the responsibility to identify and support other Airmen (Regular Air
    Force, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Civilians and Family Members) in
    times of need. Each Airman must be aware of the following:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25592"><span id="SPAN-25593">(1)
    Command is available and trained to provide support to Airmen in need, or those
    attempting to support their Airmen; (2) The Air Force established numerous
    resources aimed at resolving problems and stressors. Airmen can access these
    resources through chaplains, medical services or command leadership; (3) Airman
    can access counseling through Military One Source (1-800-342-9647) as well as
    Military Family Life Counselors; and (4) National resources like the Military
    Crisis line (1-800-273-8233, Press 1). Early identification combined with
    proactive problem solving enhances careers. Early intervention increases the
    probability of success, and is most likely to save a life; similarly, this
    helps maintain the balance promoted through the four domains of Comprehensive
    Airmen Fitness (Social, Mental, Physical and Spiritual). There are a number of
    identifiable risk factors and warning signs. These may include: (1) multiple
    stressors or an intense stressor, sudden mood or behavior changes; (2) giving
    away personal effects; and (3) making statements about suicide/suggesting it
    would be better if the individual were not alive. Safety is increased when an
    at-risk Airman has limited access to means of self-harm (e.g., firearms or
    potentially dangerous medications). Command and Legal should be part of this
    process. Any sudden purchase of lethal means can be a very significant warning
    sign that should be questioned and reported.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25594"><span id="SPAN-25595">18.46.1.<b id="B-25596">&nbsp;</b>The
    people most likely to spot a person at risk for suicide are the ones who
    interact with that person on a daily basis (e.g., friends, coworkers or
    immediate supervisors). These individuals are best positioned to notice changes
    in an atrisk Airman's behavior, mood, and performance. Engage with that person,
    find out what caused the observed changes, assist in choosing resources to
    resolve stressors, and communicate concerns with the chain of command as
    appropriate.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25597"><span id="SPAN-25598">18.46.2. Know your
    resources and encourage appropriate help-seeking from installation and other
    support agencies to resolve the challenges. Challenges and stressors are a
    normal part of each person's life. You are encouraged to engage with fellow
    Airman and know how they generally look and behave. When you notice there is a
    problem, assist your fellow Airman in finding help to resolve the challenge early.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25599"><b id="B-25600"><span id="SPAN-25601">18.47. Military Leadership Role in Preventing
    Suicide:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-25602"><span id="SPAN-25603">18.47.1. While suicide
    prevention is the ultimate responsibility of every Airman, the Air Force has
    identified that leadership support and action across the levels of command are
    critical to the goal of reducing suicide in the Air Force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25604"><span id="SPAN-25605">18.47.2.
    The Air Force Suicide Prevention program is based on leadership action. Leaders
    at all levels are responsible for implementing this program. Successful risk
    identification rests with the Airman's most immediate associates and his or her
    first-line supervisors who see and interact with them on a daily basis and are
    in a position to see any changes in behavior or performance that may signal a
    problem. Open communication between Airmen and their supervisors, especially in
    an environment where there is genuine concern for everyone's well-being, is
    vitally important.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25606"><span id="SPAN-25607">18.47.3.
    Frontline supervisors have tremendous and complex responsibilities in our high
    ops tempo Air Force, executing the mission and taking care of their
    subordinates. Effective training and strong leadership can enhance the support
    that an Airman will receive. Some factors that can challenge effective
    supervision are: (1) tunnel vision on the mission to the exclusion of
    subordinate needs; (2) not being engaged with their Airmen; (3) difficulty
    recognizing risk factors and warning signs; (4) lack of knowledge of Air Force
    supported resources and the true impact of seeking help on an Air Force career;
    and (5) inappropriately  protecting  the Airman from the consequences of their
    actions or failing to take proper action. Some examples of inappropriate
    supervisor actions are supervisors telling subordinates to avoid seeking mental
    health assistance as this will hurt their career, helping subordinates hide alcohol
    and drug misuse problems, promoting the avoidance of installation helping
    services and possible safe and constructive resolution of problems. The
    majority of the time, seeking help appropriately does not have long-term
    negative career impact. In fact, seeking help can improve performance and
    enable people to better solve problems. Supervisors should engage in problems
    early to ensure subordinates get the help they need to maintain peak
    performance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25608"><span id="SPAN-25609">18.47.4.
    When risk is identified, appropriate professional resources can be obtained and
    applied to the problem. The Air Force has invested in the development of
    outstanding helping resources whose purpose is to support individuals in
    distress, leaders in enhancing safety, promoting balance in the four domains of
    Comprehensive Airmen Fitness and preventing suicide. Appropriate intervention
    will vary depending on the nature of the problem and degree of risk. Sometimes
    situations require services from multiple support agencies (e.g., Mental
    Health, Airman &amp; Family Readiness and Chaplains, etc.). The Airman's Guide
    for Assisting Personnel in Distress provides resources to help supervisors and
    Airmen guide personnel to appropriate helping agencies and is available

    <p id="P-25617"><span id="SPAN-25618">While
    not every suicide can be prevented, definite steps can be taken by Air Force
    personnel to reduce risk in Air Force populations. The following actions can be
    taken to support Airmen in resolving life's challenges and reducing the number
    of suicides: (1) Knowing your co-workers; their usual mood and behaviors, and
    how they are functioning; (2) Being able to recognize early signs of risk,
    stress and distress; (3) Engaging with Airmen to determine what may be
    stressful or problematic; (4) Assisting Airmen with choosing the most
    appropriate resource to help resolve the problem; and (5) Following up with
    Airmen to ensure the stressors are resolving and new ones are not taking their
    place.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25619"><b id="B-25620"><span id="SPAN-25621">18.49. Psychological Services.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-25622"><span id="SPAN-25623">Mental Health Services
    are designed to be a force multiplier in the Air Force. Seeking care for a
    mental health problem is a sign of strength and increases the likelihood of
    recovery while reducing risk for suicide. More than 12% of Air Force personnel
    voluntarily seek mental health services each year.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25624"><span id="SPAN-25625">18.49.1.
    At the installation level, mental health clinic staff members typically perform
    a risk assessment on all individuals who come in for services as well as screen
    for suicide at follow up appointments. The services and treatment provided at
    mental health clinics play an important role in suicide prevention, but the
    healthcare system does not own the problem and can only act if aware of the
    problem. This means individuals at risk must either seek help themselves or be
    brought into the healthcare system by others. Suicide prevention is the
    responsibility of the entire Air Force community.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25626"><span id="SPAN-25627">18.49.2.
    A common fear is that seeking care at the mental health clinic will have
    negative impact on the person's career. A 2006 study (Rowan, A.B. &amp; Campise
    R. L., 2006) reviewing more than 1,000 self-referred mental health cases found
    that in 89 percent of cases there was no contact at all between the mental

    <p id="P-25645"><span id="SPAN-25646">Commander,
    commissioned an integrated product team composed of all functional areas of the

    chair the 75-member committee and develop suicide prevention strategies. The
    suicide prevention integrated product team quickly realized suicide was not a
    medical problem, but instead was a community problem. To establish an effective
    program, they designed a line program owned by the Chief of Staff of the Air
    Force with the Air Force Surgeon General as the office of primary
    responsibility. The program was founded upon the concept that decreasing
    suicides required a community/Public Health approach in which prevention and

    for Disease Control and academic researchers and theorists, to address the
    issue of suicide in the Air Force and move the program forward. Based on the
    recommendations of the Summit, six interconnected Suicide Prevention Lines of

    you see or hear any of the warning signs discussed in this section, or are
    aware of risk factors in someone's life, ask questions to learn more about the
    person's problems or concerns. If you have any concerns about someone's safety,
    calmly but directly ask the question,  Are you thinking of killing/hurting yourself? 
    Asking about suicide gives people permission to talk about a subject that may
    otherwise be difficult to bring up and lets the Airman know you are ready to
    discuss what they are experiencing. Do not promise to keep thoughts of suicide
    a secret. Airmen need to remember the importance of sharing these concerns with
    command and professionals who can help the person.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25680"><span id="SPAN-25681">18.51.1.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-25682">Care.
    S</b>howing care and concern for those at risk is important. Simply taking the
    time to ask about problems, and asking specifically about suicide shows caring
    and concern. If someone acknowledges thoughts of suicide, listen to them and
    allow them to share what is troubling them. Avoid making judgmental statements,
    such as  you wouldn t do something so stupid  or immediately trying to solve
    their problem or talk them out of suicide. If they have shared thoughts of
    suicide with you, accept that they are in distress, listen to their concerns,
    and begin the process of getting them help. You should also identify if they
    have a plan for suicide, what the plan is, and attempt to remove anything that
    might be used for self-harm, such as weapons or medications. First, understand
    there are many potential means for self-harm and recommend you take reasonable
    steps to secure the potential means of suicide while not putting yourself in
    harm's way. If you are not able to secure the potential means of selfharm, or
    you have significant concern about the individual's safety, then command and
    emergency services need to be contacted.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25683"><span id="SPAN-25684">18.51.1.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-25685">Escort.&nbsp;</b>After
    asking about suicide and showing concern, the final step is to escort the
    person to command, or a professional support agency that can provide
    appropriate assistance. Do not leave him or her alone, or send the person alone
    to a chaplain or mental health clinic as he or she may change his or her mind
    on the way. At most bases, chaplains and mental health professionals are on
    call through the command post, and evaluations can be conducted in local
    emergency rooms if on-base services are not accessible. If an Airman reveals
    that he or she is thinking about suicide, this is a life or death emergency and
    command must be contacted. If a distressed Airman will not agree to go with
    you, you should contact your chain of command or emergency services for help to
    ensure the person's safety.</span></p>

    a fellow Airman. Engage the Airman to understand the problem. Utilize
    leadership to support safety and good decision-making. In non-crisis situations
    utilize resources such as chaplain services, Military Family Life Counselors or
    Military One Source. If an Airman is in crisis utilize emergency services
    including Air Force, local civilian or national resources, 911, emergency room,

    <p id="P-25695"><span id="SPAN-25696">Understanding
    the difference between operational stress and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
    (PTSD) is important. Most individuals who experience a traumatic event in an
    operational environment will have some reaction and some signs of  stress' like
    problems with sleep or troublesome memories; however, the majority of
    individuals exposed to a traumatic event will not develop PTSD. PTSD is a
    complex mental health diagnosis made by trained professionals for individuals
    meeting specific diagnostic criteria. Prolonged or repeated exposures to
    stressful or traumatic events increase the chance of stress reactions, and if
    over looked or untreated can lead to mental health symptoms to include
    recurrent and unwanted thoughts, images and dreams, exaggerated startle
    response, and avoidance of situations or activities that remind the individual
    of aspects of the traumatic event. PTSD also causes persistent mood symptoms,
    including feelings of depression, foreshortened sense of the future, and an
    inability to express the full range of emotions. This latter symptom is often
    noticed by friends and family members who are more likely to notice a mood or
    behavioral change in the individual with PTSD. Since the dawn of time, people
    have experienced traumatic events and many have the skills and resources to
    deal with them. For this reason most stress reactions resolve on their own or
    with minimal assistance, especially when identified early. Therefore, the
    benefit to the individual, unit and mission is to recognize and respond to
    stressors and stress-related symptoms proactively when they are present in the
    unit or individual. However, do not assume that simply because someone has been
    exposed to trauma, they will inevitably develop PTSD. If symptoms from a
    traumatic event emerge, they usually emerge within the first 30 days of the
    trauma and for someone to develop delayed onset PTSD in the absence of any
    initial symptoms is unusual. Some of the symptoms of PTSD you might notice in
    yourself or your wingmen are listed below. Depending on many factors, like the
    severity and number of exposures, for a small subset of individuals, stress
    reactions do not resolve on their own, and symptoms of PTSD may develop. The
    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual5 defines PTSD by eight criteria: (1) stressor
    (there must be a traumatic incident the person was exposed to); (2) intrusive
    symptoms (the person persistently re-experiences the event); (3) avoidance (the
    person attempts to avoid reminders of the event); (4) negative alterations in
    cognitions (thoughts) and mood; (5) alterations in arousal and reactivity (like
    irritability, easy startle and sleep difficulties); (6) duration (persistence
    of symptoms greater than one month); (7) functional significance (impact to
    functional areas (e.g., social, occupational)); and (8) exclusion (disturbance
    not due to medication, substance use or other illness). As with most mental
    health diagnoses, other conditions must first be ruled-out before a diagnosis
    of PTSD can be made. This includes the effects of medication, alcohol or a
    co-existing medical condition that shares some of the symptoms of PTSD.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25697"><b id="B-25698"><span id="SPAN-25699">18.53. PTSD Incidence.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-25700"><span id="SPAN-25701">New
    rates of diagnosed PTSD continue to remain relatively low (under 1%) among
    total force Airmen, but differ by gender and career group. Women are twice as
    likely to be diagnosed with PTSD as men, and specific career fields show
    elevated rates of PTSD, including special investigators, medical, and support
    personnel. Deployment is a risk factor for PTSD because deployment increases
    the likelihood of exposure to trauma. However, an important note is that most
    people who develop PTSD experience a non-combat trauma such as interpersonal
    violence which can occur in a number of different environments.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25702"><b id="B-25703"><span id="SPAN-25704">18.54. Prevention.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-25705"><span id="SPAN-25706">The
    prevention of PTSD occurs by fostering resilient coping responses to stress.
    The more psychologically capable the individual is to withstand a stressful
    situation, the less likely that individual is to develop PTSD. An internal
    locus of control, the belief that and commitment to life values, and a
    supportive peer network are all factors that bolster the stress response and
    enable Airmen to go through trauma without negative consequences. Further, the
    ability to recognize stress reactions and intervene when they are present is
    important in the prevention of PTSD and other mental health issues. This is
    based on the theory that preparation for trauma helps to  insulate  the
    individual and gain a sense of control or mastery over the environment.
    Deploying Airman receive just in time training on stress reactions,
    psychological first aid, and referral resources through online Pre-Deployment
    mental health training (in Advanced Distributed Learning Service).
    Additionally, post deployment training (currently provided by installation
    mental health staff) focuses on the reintegration back into home life and work
    after a deployment and how to recognize stress reactions and symptoms that can
    remain or emerge following a deployment where there have been potentially
    traumatic experiences. Critical to the prevention of PTSD is for leaders to
    clearly communicate mission details and expectations to the extent possible so
    that deploying Airmen can anticipate their deployment experiences and practice
    adaptive coping responses prior to exposure to trauma. Preparation also helps
    Airman evaluate the possible difficulties they may experience during deployment
    and develop a plan for managing those difficulties before they occur.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25707"><span id="SPAN-25708">18.54.1.<b id="B-25709">&nbsp;Risk and Protective Factors.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25710"><span id="SPAN-25711">18.54.1.1.
    There are many factors that can make an individual more vulnerable to negative
    effects of traumatic experiences and to eventually develop PTSD. Some of these
    include ongoing life stresses, lack of social support, history of a psychiatric
    disorder/or family history of one, and past stresses like prior combat
    exposure, and even childhood history of abuse. Each individual has different
    personal strengths and resilience skills that help him or her deal with
    traumatic experiences. Therefore, each unit is a sum of these strengths and
    each deployed unit should capitalize on these strengths. Understanding your
    personal strengths and vulnerabilities and those of the others in your unit
    allows you to intervene early after a traumatic event and seek out the support
    needed for resolving stress reactions. Remember, risk factors or even exposure
    to horrific events do not equal a diagnosis of PTSD.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25712"><span id="SPAN-25713">18.54.1.2.
    Effective unit leadership is a critical factor in preventing PTSD. A cohesive
    unit with solid leadership, clear operational goals, and frequent communication
    can reduce risk. Leadership which stresses and Airmen who practice good
    self-care (getting regular and adequate sleep, eating a balanced diet, and
    having adequate time for rest and relaxation) along with the use of positive
    stress management skills can help reduce operational stress and decrease the
    risk of PTSD. Informed leaders can actively impact their units to reduce the
    risk of PTSD and other related problems to their Airmen by ensuring they are
    engaged and working as a team.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25755"><span id="SPAN-25756">18.54.4.1.
    The goal of Pre-Exposure preparation is to enhance resilience through
    anticipating and understanding normal responses to unusual stressors which
    might include exposure to battle or a mass accident scene with human
    casualties. Individuals are better prepared, are calmer and feel more in
    control when they have some advance knowledge of what to expect on scene and
    what stress reactions are normal and to be expected. Pre-Exposure preparation
    focuses on preparing Airmen for a particular mission or incident by providing
    relevant (and sometimes graphic) details applicable to the probable upcoming
    mission or situation. In preparing Airmen for a mission, PreExposure
    preparation training will educate the Airman on three key steps to support
    successful performance under stress by: (1) Being aware of the individual s
    functioning and changes in functioning (such as changes in their behavior,
    sleep, or mood); (2) Identifying and practicing positive stress management
    behaviors (such as getting proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise); and (3)
    Avoiding unhelpful coping behaviors (such as excessive alcohol usage, poor
    sleep or eating practices, etc). Pre-Exposure preparation should be tailored to
    the unit and specific mission in order to be relevant and effective.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25767"><b id="B-25768"><span id="SPAN-25769">18.55. Treatment.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-25770"><span id="SPAN-25771">Today,
    there are treatments available for PTSD that have been demonstrated through
    rigorous scientific research to be high effective. These are referred to as
    Evidence-Based Treatments. The Air Force has supported training in two
    EvidenceBased Treatments by requiring training in one or more Evidence-Based
    Treatments during mental health residency programs in psychiatry, psychology,
    and social work. Direct accession providers receive training in Evidence-Based
    Treatments during their first assignment through a collaborative arrangement
    with the Center for Deployment Psychology. The two Evidence-Based Treatments
    that are taught to all mental health providers in the United States Air Force
    are: (a) Cognitive Processing Therapy; and (b) Prolonged Exposure. These are
    among the Evidence-Based Treatments that have been recommended as first-line
    treatment of PTSD by the Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense Clinical
    Practice Guidelines based on a detailed review of the scientific literature.
    Typical treatment protocols include 10-12, weekly sessions with a trained
    provider in a supportive, therapeutic environment. Most research indicates that
    Evidence-Based Treatments reduces PTSD symptoms by approximately 50% and that
    this improvement is sustained over several months to years. In many cases,
    Airmen diagnosed with PTSD and treated with Evidence-Based Treatments will
     lose  the PTSD diagnosis and will notice that symptoms either disappear
    entirely, or are sub-threshold and do not interfere with quality of life. If
    properly treated, the majority of Airmen diagnosed with PTSD never require a
    medical board.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25779"><span id="SPAN-25780">18.56.1.
    At some point in your life, you have probably experienced stress. Long work
    days, increased deployments, and financial issues are just a few of the things
    that can make you feel stressed. The frequency of stress and the significant
    negative effect stress can have on people and organizations make this a major
    concern of enlisted leaders at all levels. The importance at the organizational
    level is because stress can negatively affect performance, organizational
    effectiveness, and mission accomplishment. On a personal level, experiencing
    stress over an extended period of time can lead to health problems and affect
    your overall quality of life. Therefore, the importance is to personally and
    professionally recognize stress and to learn how to manage stress effectively.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25781"><span id="SPAN-25782">18.56.2. Stress is a
    dynamic concept that dates back to earlier this century. According to Jerrold
    S. Greenberg in his book&nbsp;<i id="I-25783">Comprehensive Stress Management</i>, the
    concept of stress is based on the research of two individuals named Walter
    Cannon and Hans Selye. Cannon, a physiologist at Harvard Medical School, was
    the first person to describe the body's reaction to stress. He identified this
    reaction as a response to a perceived threat that prepared the body for flight
    or fight. Later research conducted by Selye, an endocrinologist widely regarded
    as the father of stress research, concluded that the body's reaction to stress
    was the same regardless of whether the source was good or bad, positive or
    negative. He also provided us with a useful definition of stress. According to
    Selye, stress can be defined as  the nonspecific response of the body to any
    demand for change.  The demand in Selye's definition is commonly called a
    stressor.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25784"><span id="SPAN-25785">18.56.3. A stressor can be more accurately defined as any factor (demand)
    that has the potential to cause stress. This factor can be positive, such as
    getting promoted, or negative, such as getting fired. The causes of stress is
    from either positive or negative factors. Selye labeled the stress experienced
    from positive factors eustress. Eustress results from exhilarating experiences
    and is the stress of winning and achieving. He labeled the stress experienced
    from negative factors distress.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25786"><span id="SPAN-25787">Distress includes the
    stress of losing, failing, overworking, and not coping effectively. When you
    start to feel  stressed out,  distress is usually the type of stress you are
    feeling.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25788"><span id="SPAN-25789">18.56.4. We are in daily
    contact with many types of stressors. For the most part, we can categorize them
    into two major areas: organizational stressors and extra-organizational
    stressors.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25790"><span id="SPAN-25791">18.56.4.1.
    Organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced in the work
    environment. For Airmen today, that could range from short-notice deployments
    to hazardous working conditions. Imagine how you would feel if your commander
    informed you that you would deploy in a week, or how you might feel if your
    work environment was bombarded with loud noises all day. If these types of
    situations regularly happen to you and you have not developed effective ways to
    cope with them, you could experience stress.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25792"><span id="SPAN-25793">18.56.4.2.
    Extra-organizational stressors are the type of factors experienced outside the
    work environment. Three major extra-organizational stressors are family,
    marital, and financial issues. Family and marital issues can run the gamut from
    minor illness to conflicting roles in the family to a death in the family.
    Similarly, financial problems can run from the minor to the catastrophic. These
    types of stressors are important because while they usually occur outside of
    the duty section, if not properly managed, they can affect performance at work.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25794"><span id="SPAN-25795">18.56.5.
    How do you know if you are stressed? Stress reactions appear in four different
    categories: cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and physical. The key to
    recognizing stress is to know understand what is normal for you so that you can
    recognize when something has changed. The combined presence of symptoms
    determines the degree of the problem.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25796"><span id="SPAN-25797">Indicators (Figure 18.6)
    may be isolated reactions or combinations among the four categories. Finally,
    the duration, frequency, and intensity of the symptoms could make dealing with
    stress difficult.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25798"><span id="SPAN-25799">18.56.6.
    Being able to recognize the symptoms of stress is important, not only for
    yourself, but for your Airmen, as well. The earlier you identify what stress
    does to your body and state of mind, the earlier you can employ stress
    reduction techniques.</span></p>

    management programs and methods vary, but they all tend to have common goals.
    Individual stress management methods aim at strengthening your ability to
    manage stressors and the stress response. Organizational stress management
    methods aim more at altering potential stressors themselves. Because
    organizational and extra-organizational stressors are interrelated and
    influence each other, attention to both stress management methods is vitally
    important.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25925"><span id="SPAN-25926">You
    can reduce stress by identifying potential stressors before they cause
    problems. Once you identify stressors, you can develop strategies to avoid
    their effects while achieving your goals. For example, if you are stressed by crowds
    and long lines, don t plan to visit the commissary on or just after payday. If
    you get extremely upset when you are recalled in the middle of the night,
    having the latest recall roster and procedures readily available at all times
    may help reduce the amount of stress you feel. While planning can t prevent
    stress that occurs as an event is happening, planning is extremely valuable in
    preventing stress before a stressor occurs.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25927"><span id="SPAN-25928">18.57.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-25929">Time Management.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25930"><span id="SPAN-25931">Not having enough time to complete a task can be
    a significant stressor for some people. If time management is an issue for you,
    you can reduce stress by using effective time management skills and tools, like
    developing a task list and prioritizing tasks.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25932"><span id="SPAN-25933">18.57.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-25934">Overload Avoidance.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25935"><span id="SPAN-25936">For
    most people to eliminate, or at least reduce, the effects of overload-related
    stressors is relatively simple. For a start, identify and avoid busy work,
    delegate or empower others when possible, learn to say no, and attempt to
    negotiate unreasonable deadlines.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25937"><span id="SPAN-25938">18.57.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-25939">Relaxation.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25940"><span id="SPAN-25941">Relaxation
    can help you manage stress and stay alert, energetic, and productive. When you
    relax, you reduce mind and body tension. By incorporating relaxation skills
    into your daily routines, you can train your body to respond differently to
    stress. Relaxation techniques, such as meditation, reading, and listening to
    music, can improve your heart rate, regulate your blood pressure, and decrease
    your respiratory rate. If you are experiencing stress in your life, taking the
    time to relax can reduce the negative effects of stress on your health.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25945"><span id="SPAN-25946">Regular
    exercise combined with a healthy diet is an effective stress management
    technique. Exercise can provide an outlet for excess energy and tension caused
    by stress. Eating nutritious foods ensures your body has the nutrients needed
    to manage stress, and helps prevent overeating. Exercising and eating a
    balanced diet help your body become more resistant to the negative results of
    stress, such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and frequent illness.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25950"><span id="SPAN-25951">Having a strong social
    support network such as family, friends, social clubs, peers etc. can help you
    manage stress.&nbsp;Being able to discuss your problems with people who
    care about you and your wellbeing can help reduce your stress by giving you a
    more positive outlook, suggest solutions to your problems, or just listen. Just
    talking about your problems and letting them out can help release any built-up
    tension and may make you see the situation or problem more clearly.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Stress Management Methods.</b>&nbsp;As an Airman or a supervisor, your approach
    to dealing with stress can help reduce your and your subordinates' stress
    levels. You can begin by identifying potential stressors in the work
    environment and developing strategies to remove or reduce them. Here are a few
    examples of organizational stress management methods you can use:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25957"><span id="SPAN-25958">18.58.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-25959">Job Design.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25960"><span id="SPAN-25961">If
    you identify potential sources of stress associated with tasks, ask yourself if
    there is a need for each task and if the task is feasible. Eliminate the task
    if not needed. If the task is feasible, ask yourself how important job design
    is and prioritize. If your job requires you and/or your subordinates to work
    long hours, consider using elements of job enrichment, like giving adequate
    time off or periodic breaks to help reduce potential stress. If within your
    power restructure the job to better accommodate individual needs and the
    abilities of your Airmen to help reduce stress and enhance productivity.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25962"><span id="SPAN-25963">18.58.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-25964">Improving the Work Environment.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25965"><span id="SPAN-25966">Numerous
    physical factors within a work environment can be potential stressors. Some of
    these stressors cannot be eliminated, but you may be able to reduce them.
    Examine such environmental factors as temperature, noise, light levels, and
    make necessary improvements.</span></p>

    Communication.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25970"><span id="SPAN-25971">A
    lack of information can be a significant stressor. As a supervisor, you should
    do your best to keep your subordinates informed about anything that could
    impact their lives. In addition, you should practice good communication skills,
    like active listening, being open minded and avoiding prejudging, and humility.
    These skills not only will help reduce stress, but also promote trust,
    cooperation, and teamwork within the work center.</span></p>

    Placement.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-25975"><span id="SPAN-25976">Having
    the wrong person in a job position can create a great deal of stress for the
    individual and others. When possible, you should carefully match individuals to
    a position they are qualified for based on their skills, level of experience,
    and rank. In the military, this might not be the easiest thing to do, but you
    should keep in mind the potential stress-related benefits of having the right
    person in the right position.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25980"><span id="SPAN-25981">Having
    conflict with co-workers can cause serious stress within the work center. Look
    for ways to help resolve any issues you or subordinates may have with others.
    Sit down and talk with the person with whom you are having conflict with,
    listen to their point of view and understand what the other person is saying,
    communicate your point of view in a calm and professional way, and try to come
    to an agreement or compromise. If the conflict can t be resolved amongst
    yourselves you may need to have a mediator to help resolve the
    issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-25994"><span id="SPAN-25995">The

    readiness throughout the air and space expeditionary force cycle by providing
    timely support for our military members and their families. Redeployment
    support is an ongoing process, not a homecoming event. The intent is to provide
    continuous, integrated support from the area of responsibility to home station
    and to assist in the transition from the deployed environment to family life
    and work site.</span></p>

    <p id="P-25999"><span id="SPAN-26000">After
    periods of arduous duty and protracted periods of deployment, a lengthy respite
    from the deployment environment has a beneficial effect on an individual s
    psychological and physical status. An immediate recovery period also provides
    time for the returning Airman to tend to personal needs neglected during
    lengthy periods away from home. Each major command is responsible for
    establishing and publishing personnel recovery (leave, passes, attribution, and
    retention) policies for returning combat forces. See AFI 36-3003,&nbsp;<i id="I-26001">Military

    <p id="P-26005"><span id="SPAN-26006">Although
    recovery is important to support returning forces as they transition back to
    their normal environment, they also must be reconstituted for further
    deployment possibilities, including surge requirements. This process entails
    planning that will return units back to full combat capability in a short time.
    While there is no one correct rule set for reconstitution planning,
    consideration must be given to prioritizing and restoring levels of consumables
    expended during the crisis, and recovering lost training. Every base/unit must
    assess their own situation based on such variables as the magnitude, duration,
    and intensity of a crisis, consumption rates, and the type of deployment
    location (fixed versus austere base). See AFI 10401,&nbsp;<i id="I-26007">Air Force

    military and civilian personnel, their family members, and units during the air

    Base profiling is a process within signature management that identifies the
    local operating environment and captures process points that present key
    signatures and profiles with critical information value. This process is the

    Force forces can be under observation at their peacetime bases and locations,
    in training or exercises, while moving, or when deployed to the field
    conducting actual operations. Operation security methodology provides
    systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify observable friendly
    actions that could reveal intentions or capabilities. Air Force units utilize
    the base profiling process to identify vulnerabilities and indicators of their
    day-to-day activities. With this understanding, Air Force operation security
    program managers use the signature management methodology to apply measures
    and/or countermeasures to hide, control, or simulate
    indicators.&nbsp;Therefore, operation security principles must be
    integrated into operational, support, exercise, and acquisition planning.
    Operation security is incorporated into day-to-day activities to ensure a seamless
    transition to contingency operations. The operation security process consists

    The Air Force Integrated Defense Program is the integration of
    multidisciplinary active and passive, offensive and defensive capabilities,
    employed to mitigate potential risks and defeat adversary threats to Air Force
    operations within the base boundary and the base security zone. These threats
    include, but are not limited to, terrorist, insiders, criminals, and foreign
    intelligence and security services. To integrate Integrated Defense efforts
    with other Air Force capabilities to achieve synergistic effects using an
    all-hazards approach is critical. Potential hazards to an installation include,
    but are not limited to, chemical biological radiological nuclear-high yield explosive
    attacks, natural and man-made disasters, major accidents, and accidental or
    deliberate release of hazardous materials, toxic industrial materials or
    chemicals (see AFPD 31-1,&nbsp;<i id="I-26489">Integrated Defense</i>). Integrated Defense
    is a fundamental battle competency for all Airmen, whether garrison or
    deployed. The teaming of Integrated Defense forces creates a united, seamless
    defense stronger than the defensive efforts of individuals/or individual units.
    This effort ensures all Airmen are trained to defend themselves and integrate
    into defense operations while in garrison or deployed. Installation commanders
    determine the effects required of Integrated Defense operations at Air Force
    installations based on a four-step process that involves:&nbsp;<b id="B-26490">&nbsp;</b></span></p>

    execute the Integrated Defense mission.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26499"><span id="SPAN-26500">19.10.2.
    Integrated defense is an  all-Airmen  program. However, Air Force Security
    Forces have enterprise lead in Integrated Defense operations. The defense force
    commander synchronizes integrated defense operations with emergency and
    consequence management activities articulated in applicable Air Force and
    Department of Defense publications.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26501"><span id="SPAN-26502">19.10.3.
    The goal of Integrated Defense is to neutralize security threats within the
    base boundary and the base security zone in order to ensure unhindered Air
    Force operations. Through Integrated Defense, commanders must: (1) minimize
    mission degradation from threat activity within the base boundary and
    coordinate necessary security operations support within the base security zone
    when the base security zone is not congruent with the base boundary; (2)
    minimize loss of life and injury from threat activity; and (3) protect
    government property and personnel from hostile and criminal acts.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26503"><span id="SPAN-26504">19.10.4.
    Integrated Defense does not stand alone to protect personnel and resources;
    planners create an effective security program by coordinating with other
    Department of Defense and Air Force programs. Furthermore, the protection and
    defense of air bases requires the coordinated effort of emergency management,
    antiterrorism, and other mission support function forces under the mission
    assurance umbrella. This coordinated planning provides a seamless progression
    of mission assurance programs and completes the installation's defense in depth
    picture.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26505"><span id="SPAN-26506">19.10.5.<b id="B-26507">&nbsp;</b>Joint
    Publications define the base boundary as a line that delineates the surface
    area of a base for the purpose of facilitating coordination and deconfliction
    of operations between adjacent units, formations, or areas. See Figure 19.1 for
    an example of a base boundary configuration. Therefore, the base boundary is
    not necessarily the base perimeter. Rather, the base boundary should be
    established based upon the factors of mission, enemy, terrain and weather,
    troops and support available, time available, civil considerations,
    specifically balancing the need of the base defense forces to control key
    terrain with their ability to accomplish the mission. These measures decrease
    the likelihood of fratricide, prevent noncombatant casualties, and minimize
    damage to the property of friendly civilians. Boundaries may not necessarily
    coincide with the fenced perimeter, property lines or legal boundaries.
    Nevertheless, while tactical considerations will ideally determine Integrated
    Defense boundaries, the defense force commander will strictly adhere to legal,
    jurisdictional, host nation constraints, commander's intent, and higher echelon
    orders and directives when conducting operations within the base boundary.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26508"><span id="SPAN-26509">19.10.6.<b id="B-26510">&nbsp;</b>The
    base security zone is an Air Force unique concept and term to be used

    Configuration&nbsp;</span></b><span id="SPAN-26516">may be vulnerable from standoff threats (for
    example, mortars, rockets, man portable aerial defense systems). The
    installation commander should identify the base security zone and coordinate
    via the operational chain of command with local, state, federal agencies
    (within the continental United States) or host nation or area commander
    (outside the continental United States) for the base security zone to be
    identified as the base boundary. If the base boundary does not include all of
    the base security zone terrain, the installation commander is still
    responsible&nbsp;for&nbsp;either&nbsp;mitigating&nbsp;(through
    coordination with local, state, federal agencies (continental United States) or
    the area commander or host nation (outside the continental United States) or
    accepting the risks of enemy attack from the terrain outside the base boundary.
    The base security zone, in the simplest terms, is the area from which a threat
    can launch an attack against base personnel and resources or aircraft
    approaching/departing the base. Air-minded forces must consider the base
    security zone for planning constructs continental United States, outside the
    continental United States, and at contingency locations. Threats vary in the
    Integrated Defense continuum from peacetime to wartime, regardless of the
    location of our installations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26517"><span id="SPAN-26518">19.10.6.1.
    Optimally, the base security zone and the base boundary are the same, but that
    is not always the case. The base security zone may, for planning purposes,
    incorporate more geographical area than the base boundary. For example, there
    may be key terrain outside the base boundary from which adversaries can impact
    air operations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26519"><span id="SPAN-26520">19.10.6.2.
    For terrain outside the base boundary, but within the base security zone, the
    defense force commander should coordinate with local, state, federal agencies
    (continental United States) or host nation or area commander (outside the
    continental United States) to conduct base defense tasks within the area. If
    these forces/agencies are not available due to competing requirements, then the
    defense force commander should coordinate via their operational chain of
    command with the appropriate area commander to conduct the base defense task.
    When defense forces operate outside the base boundary, the appropriate area of
    operations commander should exercise tactical control over those forces for
    base defense purposes only. Joint and coalition forces entering the base
    boundary should inform the base defense operations center before they enter,
    and monitor the base defense operations center's communication net while
    operating in the area.</span></p>

    The base defense operations center is the command and control center for
    Integrated Defense operations during routine and emergency operations. The
    defense force commander will establish a base defense operations center to
    coordinate and direct, via their operational chain of command, the tactical
    control of Integrated Defense forces and supporting capabilities. All functions
    performed by central security control, the law enforcement desk, or other
    security forces control centers will be performed by the base defense

    Ideally, defense forces receive such good intelligence they are able to

    value, and relative (or intrinsic) value.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26591"><span id="SPAN-26592">19.12.1.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-26593">Step
    2 and Step 3: Develop the Threat Assessment and Vulnerability Assessment.</b>&nbsp;Threat
    multiplied by vulnerability determines the probability of loss (or damage) of
    the asset. Threats are generally considered in terms of adversaries and their
    tactics (for example, hackers, terrorists, criminals, protestors). To know if
    adversaries pose a threat requires information about their operational
    capability, intentions, activity, operating environment, and history.
    Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that can be exploited by an adversary because of
    inadequate security, lax or complacent personnel trends, vulnerable software or
    hardware, and insufficient security policies or procedures.&nbsp;<b id="B-26594">Note:</b>&nbsp;Identification
    and evaluation of existing threats and vulnerabilities are identified during
    Parts 1 through 3 of the intelligence preparation of the operational
    environment process and may be supplemented with other documents, such as
    antiterrorism vulnerability assessments.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26595"><span id="SPAN-26596">19.12.1.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-26597">Step
    4: Develop the Risk Assessment.</b>&nbsp;Once all previous assessments
    (criticality, threat, and vulnerability) are completed and studied together to
    provide a complete picture of the risks to an asset, the risk assessment can be
    developed. A quantitative measurement of risk can be determined using the
    following equation: risk = asset criticality multiplied by (threat multiplied
    by vulnerability).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26598"><span id="SPAN-26599">19.12.1.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-26600">Step
    5: Risk Tolerance Decision.&nbsp;</b>At this point in the integrated defense
    risk management process, the commander may have enough data to enable an
    informed risk tolerance decision. But if information required to assess risks
    is deficient, a command critical intelligence requirement should be developed
    or modified to guide the intelligence community's collection efforts. In
    today's resource-constrained environment, some risks must be accepted. However,
    some risks cannot be tolerated due to their frequency or severity of
    consequence. The installation commander's intent for Integrated Defense will
    define the level of tolerance. For risks exceeding the commander's tolerance
    level, countermeasures will be developed in the next step to render these risks
    more acceptable.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26601"><span id="SPAN-26602">19.12.1.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-26603">Step
    6: Present Countermeasure Courses of Action.</b>&nbsp;This step presents and
    evaluates options for reducing risks. While risks can be alleviated by reducing
    the asset's criticality or mitigating the threat, eliminating vulnerabilities
    is the area that can have the most impact on the installation commander's risk
    tolerance decision. At this time, the integrated defense working group can
    develop various countermeasure courses of action to remove or mitigate
    vulnerabilities and reduce unacceptable risks. An estimate of risk reduction
    (i.e., benefit of risk reduction) can be prepared, along with showing the costs
    associated with courses of action implementation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-26604"><span id="SPAN-26605">19.12.1.6.&nbsp;<b id="B-26606">Step
    7: Decision and Implementation.</b>&nbsp;This is the most important step in the
    integrated defense risk management process. During this step, the installation
    commander selects the course of actions that will bring the risks within
    his/her tolerance level, and directs resources to implement the decision.
    Closely tied with step 7 is continuous assessment. This feedback loop posits
    that risk management is not an event or tangible product, but rather a
    continuous cycle. The implementation of countermeasure courses of action will
    sometimes change the installation's risk posture in unexpected or unintended
    ways. By immediately identifying changes to the installation's critical assets,
    threats and vulnerabilities, decision makers can continually refine the
    installation's risk posture.</span></p>

    designating military defense aerospace vehicles categorized as: aircraft
    (standard or non-standard), guided missiles, rockets, probes, boosters, and
    satellites. The designator describes the aerospace vehicle in two components
    where the components are separated by a dash. The first component, comprised
    only of alpha characters, describes the mission of the vehicle. The second
    component, comprised of both alpha-numeric characters, describes the design

      script which was used on radio station WRC broadcast on 23 Feb 1944. Captain
      Alf Heiburg, leader of the Army Air Corps Band, interviewed Captain Robert
      Crawford, composer of the  Army Air Corps Song,  during this broadcast.

      <p id="P-29895"><span id="SPAN-29896">In 1939, when he was a civilian pilot, Robert Crawford was
      asked by a friend to enter a song contest. While flying his plane to
      Philadelphia, he composed a simple tune. The next day he wrote lyrics that,
      when combined with the tune, became what was known as the  Army Air Corps
      Song.  The United States Army Band made the first recordings of the song in
      1939. It was later renamed the Army Air Forces Song, and eventually the Air
      Force Song.</span></p>

    <p id="P-29965"><span id="SPAN-29966">20.11.1. American Airmen
    from each component   Regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force
    Reserve   provide seamless airpower on a global scale every day. Over the past
    two decades, to meet combatant commander requirements and the demands of
    recurring deployments, the Air Force has increasingly called upon its Total
    Force. This elevated use of the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve has
    transformed a traditionally strategic reserve force into a force that provides
    operational capability, strategic depth, and surge capacity.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29967"><span id="SPAN-29968">20.11.2. In Total Force
    Integration associations, the Active and Reserve Components share equipment,
    facilities and resources, including aircraft, crews and maintenance, to carry
    out a common mission. In a classic association, the Active Component is the
    host unit, retaining weapon system responsibility, while sharing the mission
    with a Reserve or Guard tenant unit. For active associations the Reserve or
    Guard unit is host, with an Active Component tenant. Integrating with the
    Active Component in this way yields numerous synergistic benefits to the Air
    Force's strength, including an improved ability to respond with surge capacity
    at a moment's notice.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29969"><span id="SPAN-29970">20.11.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-29971">Air National Guard.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29972"><span id="SPAN-29973">20.11.3.1. The heritage
    predates the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate armed
    service in 1947: it shares a community-based militia tradition with the Army
    National Guard that dates from colonial times.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29974"><span id="SPAN-29975">State National Guards
    began forming aviation units as early as 1908, and New York's 1st Aero Company
    was the first such organization mustered into federal service in 1916.
    Mobilization for World War I dissolved these state units, although many Guard
    personnel served in the Army Air Service. With the reorganization of the Army
    in 1920, the National Guard gained organic aviation units with federal
    standing. Twenty-nine observation squadrons had activated by the time the
    United States entered World War II, all absorbed into the Army Air Forces upon
    mobilization.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-29976"><span id="SPAN-29977">20.11.3.2. After federal
    service in the war, these 29 units became the core of the new Air National
    Guard, together with 43 more flying squadrons added to the Air National Guard
    after 1947. In keeping with the National Guard's previous legal status, and in
    contrast to the Air Force Reserve, the Air National Guard retained a dual role:
    each state's Air National Guard units remained at the governors' disposal when
    not called into federal service. In either status, the federal government
    provided the bulk of the Air Guard's funding. Initially, the Air National
    Guard's nominal mission was as a short-range, daytime air defense force. In
    this role, the bulk of the Air National Guard's aircraft were F-47 Thunderbolt
    and F-51 Mustangs left over from World War II, plus a few light bombers, B-26
    Invaders. A small number of early jet fighters soon supplemented the initial
    propeller-driven force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29978"><span id="SPAN-29979">20.11.3.3. The Air Guard
    received its baptism by fire during the Korean War. Sixty-seven flying
    squadrons and approximately 45,000 Air National Guard members, some 80 percent
    of the force, were mobilized. Mobilization was complicated: some units took
    three to six months to become combat ready, and some never did. The Air
    National Guard still formed a substantial part of the wartime Air Force, with
    some units serving in combat, while others relieved deploying regular squadrons
    at home.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29980"><span id="SPAN-29981">20.11.3.4. Based on
    Korean War experience, senior Air National Guard and Air Force leaders
    committed to build the Air National Guard into a more effective force, and the
    Air National Guard received modern equipment and better funding to that end. These
    efforts came to fruition when President John F. Kennedy mobilized over 21,000
    Air National Guard members from 28 squadrons in 1961 as part of the United
    States response to the Berlin Crisis. The Air National Guard deployed 216 Air
    National Guard fighter aircraft with support personnel to Europe to reinforce
    North Atlantic Treaty organization. This movement, Operation Stair Step, was
    the largest aircraft deployment in Air National Guard history. The entire
    deployment across the Atlantic Ocean occurred without the loss of a single
    plane.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29982"><span id="SPAN-29983">20.11.3.5. The war in
    Vietnam saw a few Air National Guard fighter squadrons deployed, and the Air
    Guard supplied some of the airlift into the theater. The Air Guard's main role,
    however, was support for the Air Force's commitments in Europe as the demands
    of operations in Southeast Asia taxed the regular force. The Air National Guard
    assumed aerial refueling responsibilities for Air Force fighters in Europe from
    1967 to 1977. This effort, Operation Creek Party, demonstrated that the Air
    Guard could provide sustained support to the Air Force without resorting to
    mobilization by rotating forces of volunteer personnel operating aircraft drawn
    from Air National Guard squadrons. This approach remains virtually unchanged
    today.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29984"><span id="SPAN-29985">20.11.3.6. After the
    Vietnam War, some significant missions moved to the Air National Guard. Air
    Guard KC-135 air refueling tankers began participating in the Strategic Air
    Command's nuclear alert force in 1976. In 1977, the Air National Guard became
    the primary airlifters for United States Southern Command's Operation Coronet
    Oak, which continues today. From 1978 to 1990, rotating Air National Guard
    fighter squadrons assumed responsibility for the air defense of the Panama
    Canal Zone under Operation Coronet Cove. The Air National Guard participated in
    Operation Just Cause, the 1989 invasion of Panama to expel its dictator, Manuel
    Noriega, and to install a democratically elected president. In the 1990s, Air
    Guardsmen manned radar stations and flew fighter aircraft in Latin America to
    monitor and report suspected drug-running aircraft. This operational experience
    served the Air Guard well in the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990-1991. Air National
    Guard fighters, tankers, airlifters, special operations, aeromedical
    evacuation, and security forces participated in the air campaign of the Persian
    Gulf War. During that time, 12,404 Air National Guard members were mobilized
    and deployed to Southwest Asia, Europe and other overseas locations as well as
    serving in the continental United States.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29986"><span id="SPAN-29987">20.11.3.7. Following the
    Persian Gulf War and the end of the Cold War, the Air National Guard continued
    to operate world-wide, integrated with the Regular Air Force and the Air Force
    Reserve, jointly with the other services, and combined with North Atlantic
    Treaty Organization forces. The Air National Guard participated in several
    major operations involving humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, and direct
    combat action. Some operations were extensions of those that involved the Air National
    Guard earlier in South America, but through the 1990s the Air National Guard
    gained more commitments, Bolstered by new capabilities, Air Guard flying and
    support units helped maintain the no-fly zones over Iraq, provided humanitarian
    assistance in Somalia and Rwanda, and supported peacekeeping forces in the
    Balkans and Haiti. The Air Force's global mobility operations involved Air
    National Guard tanker and airlift forces on a daily basis. In 1997, the Air
    National Guard assumed responsibility for manning First Air Force, which
    maintained the air defenses of the continental United States. President Bill
    Clinton also mobilized 4,870 Air Guardsmen during the Kosovo War in 1999.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29988"><span id="SPAN-29989">20.11.3.8.
    The Air National Guard played a critical role in the immediate United States
    response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and the subsequent
    global military actions. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Air National
    Guard improvised a greatly strengthened continental air defense system and bore
    the main burden of sustaining it. The combination of fighter patrols and
    24-hour alerts at 26 Air National Guard bases across the</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29990"><span id="SPAN-29991">United States put heavy
    stress on the Air National Guard fighter force in both training and readiness,
    but the wide geographic dispersal of its fighter units and its long standing
    role in continental air defense made the Air National Guard the right
    organization to execute the mission.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29992"><span id="SPAN-29993">20.11.3.9. The Air
    National Guard's aviation and support units also played critical roles in the
    wars in</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29994"><span id="SPAN-29995">Afghanistan
    (Operation Enduring Freedom) and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom). Flying and
    non-flying Air National Guard units deployed repeatedly to every operating base
    supporting those wars. When Operation</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-29996"><span id="SPAN-29997">Enduring Freedom began 7
    October 2001, the Air National Guard participated in the initial combat
    operations in Afghanistan and have continued to participate in the mission ever
    since. Air National Guard airlift, tankers, A-10 and F-16 units, special
    operations, rescue, civil engineer, security forces, combat communication and
    many other units have repeatedly deployed to the region over the course of that
    war. When the United States invaded Iraq on 20 March 2003, the Air National
    Guard had 18,552 members on Regualr Air Force participating in the invasion and
    serving in Afghanistan and other overseas operations. The six Air National
    Guard A-10 units participated in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan
    simultaneously. During the invasion of Iraq, the only A-10 presence in
    Afghanistan was an Air National Guard unit. Air Guard F-16C Block 30 fighters
    and a few A-10s equipped with Litening 2 targeting pods   a capability
    developed independently by the Air National Guard - provided air support for
    special operations units operating in the western desert of Iraq looking for
    SCUD missiles. In addition, Air National Guard F-16C Block 30 aircraft provided
    a unique capability as the last United States aircraft equipped with Theater
    Airborne Reconnaissance System pods. Intelligence Surveillance and
    Reconnaissance in general was a growing capability for deployed Air National
    Guard forces with the proliferation of Remotely Piloted Aircraft systems like
    the Predator.</span></p>

    establishment of the Air Force Reserve in April 1948, the Air Force Reserve has

    Citizen Airmen perform leading roles in military operations, humanitarian
    crisis and disaster relief around the globe. The Air Force Reserve consists of
    officers, enlisted and civil servants who are tasked by law to fill the needs
    of the armed forces whenever more units and people are required than are
    available within the Regular Air Force. More than 860,000 people make up the
    Ready, Standby, Retired and Regualr Air Force Retired Reserve. This includes
    nearly 70,000 Selected Reservists who are  ready-now  participating in every
    job specialty and on the front lines of daily military operations around the

    <p id="P-30011"><span id="SPAN-30012">20.11.4.4. Circa 1917:
    The National Defense Act of 1916 directed the creation of an Officers Reserve
    Corps, an Enlisted Reserve Corps and the nation's Air Service Reserve Program.
    For the first time, Reserve Corps were clearly a federal reserve force and not
    militia. The Reserve Corps were established on March 22, 1917, just weeks
    before the United States formally entered World War I. By the end of the war,
    more than 11,000 of Army Air Service pilots who fought were reserve officers.
    Notably, the First Reserve Aero Squadron deployed in the summer of 1917 for
    action in France. Later, the squadron went on to fight in the Pacific Theater
    in World War II, served at the forefront of the nuclear deterrence mission in
    the Cold War, and, still serving today as the 26th Space Aggressor Squadron, is
    the oldest squadron in the Air Force Reserve.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30013"><span id="SPAN-30014">20.11.4.5. 1941:
    Reservists played a critical role in World War II. In the war's early days
    1,500 reserve pilots along with 1,300 non-rated officers and 400 enlisted
    Airmen were activated into the Army Air Corps. These included the legendary
    Jimmy Doolittle who was ordered to Regualr Air Force to work in Detroit to
    convert automobile manufacturing plants into aircraft factories and later went
    on to lead  Doolittle's Raiders,  the first American bombing attack on the
    Japanese mainland.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30015"><span id="SPAN-30016">20.11.4.6. 1948: In a
    joint directive signed by General Omar Bradley, the Army Chief of Staff, and
    General Carl Spaatz, the Air Force Chief of Staff, dated April 14, 1948 the
    Army Air Corps Reserve was transferred to the Air Force officially becoming the
    Air Force Reserve.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30017"><span id="SPAN-30018">20.11.4.7. 1950: The
    young Air Force Reserve was barely two years old when it mobilized nearly
    147,000 reservists, many who were World War II veterans, for the Korean War
    from 1950 to 1953. The Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 refined the use of the
    Reserve Components in time of war or national emergency and established three
    levels of Air Force reservists   ready, standby, and retired.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30019"><span id="SPAN-30020">20.11.4.8. 1960 s: In
    1961, President John F. Kennedy called up the Air Force Reserve in response to
    the Berlin crisis. The mobilization included five Air Force Reserve C-124
    aircraft units and 5,613 reservists. By 1962, an additional mobilization of
    14,220 reservists and 422 aircraft were supporting operations during the Cuban
    Missile Crisis. Most experts believe that the mobilization had the effect of
    deterring war. Beginning in the early 1960s, the Air Force Reserve provided
    strategic airlift as well as counterinsurgency, close air support, tactical
    mobility, interdiction, rescue and recovery, intelligence, medical,
    maintenance, aerial port and air superiority until the United States ended its
    involvement in the Vietnam War.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30021"><span id="SPAN-30022">20.11.4.9. 1970 s: In

    aeromedical, casualty assistance, legal, chaplain, and intelligence personnel
    supported Operation Homecoming the return of the American prisoners of war from
    North Vietnam. That same year, the Air Force Reserve proved the concept of
    Global Mobility by flying hundreds of strategic airlift missions during the

    the most part, the nation was at peace for the next few years with the Air
    Force Reserve periodically engaged in emergency-response and humanitarian
    missions. This included the rescue and return of more than 700 American
    students from Grenada and evacuation of wounded Marines from Lebanon in 1983,
    the aerial-refueling of F-111 aircraft during the El Dorado Canyon raid on
    Libyan-sponsored terrorists in 1986, and Operation Just Cause that ousted

    <p id="P-30027"><span id="SPAN-30028">20.11.4.11. 1990 s:
    Nearly 23,500 Air Force Reservists were mobilized, and 15,000 volunteered for
    service in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, in response to
    Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. This began more than twenty years
    of continuous combat operations in Southwest Asia, while simultaneously
    conducting numerous emergency-response and humanitarian missions. These
    included combat operations over Bosnia, Serbia, and Kosovo, and Haiti as well
    as the evacuation of Clark Air Force Base during the eruption of Mount

    reservists responded in full measure. Air Force Reserve F-16 fighter aircraft
    flew combat air patrols to protect American cities while&nbsp; KC-135
    tankers and Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft supported security
    efforts. In October 2001, Operation Enduring Freedom began as United States
    military forces entered Afghanistan to combat the Taliban and eliminate
    terrorist sanctuaries. In March 2003, Operation Iraqi Freedom began in order to
    end Saddam Hussein's regime. Air Force Reserve units and reservists played key
    roles in all combat operations as Air Force Reserve MC-130 Combat Talon
    aircraft became the first fixed-wing aircraft to penetrate Afghan airspace
    while</span></p>

    crews performed the first combat missions. In 2004, more than 140 Air Force
    Reserve Combat Convoy Airmen served in the 1059th Air Expeditionary Force Truck
    Company. Air Force Reserve Security Forces served throughout Iraq and
    Afghanistan, and comprised the entire Security Force presence at Kirkuk Air
    Base with as many as 275 personnel. Air Force Reserve Explosive Ordnance
    Disposal provided extensive mission support in Iraq and Afghanistan by executing
    a broad scope of missions within and beyond the base security zone. Air Force
    Reserve Expeditionary Combat Support capabilities provided airfield operations,
    cargo and passenger handling, medical, security, intelligence, and personnel
    services.</span></p>

    supported combat and humanitarian missions in Haiti, Libya, Japan, Mali and the
    Horn of Africa. Also, they ve provided national disaster relief at home in the
    United States after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, the gulf oil spill and the
    wildfires in the western states. Throughout our history, Citizen Airmen have
    continually volunteered, allaying concerns that reservists would not be
    available when really needed. Since its inception, the Air Force Reserve
    evolved from an individual-mobilization-only force into an operational reserve
    that participates daily in missions around the globe. Today, Air Force
    reservists safeguard nuclear weapons and guide Global Positioning Satellites.
    From bases in the United States, reservists fly remotely piloted aircraft in
    combat half a world away. They track hurricanes out at sea and bring medical
    supplies and food into disaster areas to save lives around the world. Spanning
    six and a half decades   with the last two decades of continuous combat   the
    Air Force Reserve has fulfilled the legacy of early air pioneers and exceeded
    the potential seen by the visionaries who created it. For more information on
    the history of the Air Force Reserve, go to:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.afrc.af.mil/library/history/" id="A-30039"><span id="SPAN-30040">www.afrc.af.mil/library/history/</span></a><a href="http://www.afrc.af.mil/library/history/" id="A-30041"><span id="SPAN-30042">.</span></a></p>

    <p id="P-30892"><span id="SPAN-30893">What do you think of
    when you hear the term Organizational Design? Do you think of your
    organizational chart? Most people do, but that is only a portion of your
    organization's design. Organizational design is the process of selecting a
    formal system of communication, coordination, controls, authority, and assigned
    responsibilities necessary to achieve the organization's goals. As leaders, we
    need to understand how to select appropriate organizational designs that
    facilitate mission accomplishment. To this end, this reading will address how
    effective organizational design not only facilitates mission accomplishment but
    also enhances productivity of an organization. First, we will discuss factors
    leaders should consider when designing their organizations. Then, we will look
    at four organizational systems or designs, and discuss the organizational
    factors which determine which design is most appropriate for a given
    organization. Before we can talk about the different designs, we need to look
    at what influences or factors affect our design choice.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30894"><b id="B-30895"><span id="SPAN-30896">21.3. Design Factors:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-30897"><span id="SPAN-30898">21.3.1.
    There are many factors that<b id="B-30899">&nbsp;</b>influence how we set<b id="B-30900">&nbsp;</b>up our
    organizations. The first is&nbsp;<b id="B-30901">organizational strategy (goals).&nbsp;</b>Professor
    of Organizational Behavior Dr. Stephen Robbins states, "An organization's
    strategy<b id="B-30902">&nbsp;</b>is a means to help management achieve its objectives.
    Since objectives are derived from the organization's overall strategy,<b id="B-30903">&nbsp;</b>it
    is only logical that strategy and structure should be linked. More
    specifically, structure should follow strategy." (Robbins: 569) What Dr.
    Robbins suggestsis we<b id="B-30904">&nbsp;</b>need to identify why we<b id="B-30905">&nbsp;</b>are doing
    what we are doing, how we expect<b id="B-30906">&nbsp;</b>to get there (strategy), and then
    design our organizations to accomplish that strategy. Why does your
    organization exist?<b id="B-30907">&nbsp;</b>What are your goals?<b id="B-30908">&nbsp;</b>Does your
    mission require creativity or control? Do you need to be effective or
    efficient? Answers to these questions give us a starting point in determining
    which design the organization should use. Nevertheless, we must consider a few
    other factors.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30909"><span id="SPAN-30910">21.3.2.
    Another design factor is the&nbsp;<b id="B-30911">environment.</b>&nbsp;When we speak of the
    environment, we are not talking about the climate or the physical environment.
    We are talking about what outside forces affect the organization's processes.
    Are we dependent on other organizations or sections to do our jobs? Is the
    environment constantly in a state of flux? Are we continually changing or do we
    do the same processes repeatedly? Professor Richard Daft, author of&nbsp;<i id="I-30912">Organizational
    Theory and Design,&nbsp;</i>calls this the stableunstable dimension. "An
    environment's domain is stable if it remains the same over a period of months
    or years. Under unstable conditions, environmental elements shift
    abruptly." (Daft: 148) If our routine is unstable, this means the
    environment is constantly changing, which requires flexibility. If you can set
    your watch by it, as the clich  goes, then it is stable and allows stricter
    control. Don't be fooled into thinking that once you identify your environment
    as stable, it remains that way; it does not. We need to continually scan our
    environment to identify outside changes that affect our design. Certainly, you
    can see that the environment helps us determine which design is most
    appropriate for our organization. Just like goals, the environment works with
    other factors as well.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30913"><span id="SPAN-30914">21.3.3. The third factor
    to consider is the<b id="B-30915">&nbsp;size</b>&nbsp;of your organization. Early in your
    career, you learned the term&nbsp;<i id="I-30916">span of control.&nbsp;</i>There are only
    so many people one person can effectively manage. Once you reach a point where
    you lose effectiveness, new levels of management must be developed and more
    structure introduced. Let's assume your whole organization is a five-person
    shop. How many levels of supervision would you need? Probably one. Now add two
    more workers. Do supervision levels increase? No! How about adding 10, 20, or
    100 people? Maybe as the organization grows, so should the level of
    supervision. There comes a point where your structure becomes so rigid that
    more workers would require few, if any, additional levels of supervision.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30917"><span id="SPAN-30918">21.3.4.
    The last factor we will discuss is&nbsp;<b id="B-30919">technology.</b>&nbsp;According to
    Professor Daft, technology refers to the work processes, techniques, machines,
    and actions used to transform organizational inputs (materials, information,
    ideas) into outputs (products and services). (Daft: 266) We need to look at
    what resources we use to accomplish our mission to also help determine the best
    design for our organizations. If we primarily use new equipment with unknown
    procedures or outcomes, we would need fewer controls and more flexibility than
    if we use equipment that is old with known procedures and outcomes. In other
    words, if the equipment you use is old and well known, more structure could be
    utilized. If the equipment you use is newer, the outcomes or problems you may
    encounter require flexibility.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30920"><span id="SPAN-30921">21.3.5. These four
    factors, strategy, environment, size, and technology, all influence how we
    should design our organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30922"><span id="SPAN-30923">Let's shift our
    attention to four organizational systems or designs we can use to improve unit
    effectiveness.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30924"><b id="B-30925"><span id="SPAN-30926">21.4. Designs.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-30927"><span id="SPAN-30928">21.4.1. The first design
    we will discuss is the&nbsp;<b id="B-30929">mechanistic design</b>. Sometimes referred to as
    the bureaucratic structure, it is vertically structured; communication is
    basically up and down rather than lateral. As Dr. Robbins puts it, "The
    mechanistic model ... is synonymous with the bureaucracy in that it has
    extensive departmentalization, high formalization, a limited information
    network (mostly downward communication) and little participation by low-level
    members in decision-making." (Robbins: 569) Departmentalization means
    grouping our work tasks by specialty. The more specialized the tasks, the more
    structure is used. By high formalization, we mean a heavy reliance on rules.
    Let's look at the mechanistic system in the context of the factors discussed
    earlier. The mechanistic system lends itself well to an organization where
    strategy or goals are geared toward efficiency; tasks need to be accomplished
    quickly and accurately. An environment which is quite stable requires little
    flexibility; therefore, a rigid structure or mechanistic design should be used.
    If the size of the organization is intermediate to large, more structure is
    necessary. As discussed earlier, as organizations grow, new levels of
    supervision must be added to maintain control. Finally, technology is known.
    What we use to do our jobs is not new. We can predict day to day what will
    happen and we have procedures to follow to accomplish our tasks. The
    mechanistic organization is very efficient, and responds to decisions rapidly.
    Because of the vertical communication, procedures flow from top to bottom
    rather quickly. This is very effective for emergency services that rely on
    speed. The mechanistic design has disadvantages as well. Because of the
    reliance on rules, job satisfaction suffers because subordinates basically do
    as they are told with little to no discussion. Limited discussion also leads to
    a poor social or human relations environment as well.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30930"><span id="SPAN-30931">21.4.2.
    The&nbsp;<b id="B-30932">organic design</b>&nbsp;is just the opposite of the mechanistic.
    This design has horizontal specialization rather than vertical. According to
    Dr. Robbins, the organic system is "... flat, uses cross-hierarchical and
    cross-functional teams, has low formalization, possesses a comprehensive
    information network (utilizing lateral and upward communication as well as
    downward), and it involves high participation in decision-making."
    (Robbins: 569) Looking at an organizational chart, you would not see much
    difference between the mechanistic and the organic design. On the other hand,
    the interaction within the organization is quite different. The organic
    organization has extensive cross-communication. There is no clear line drawn
    for the communication path to follow. As workers need to communicate with
    others, they do so, free of bureaucratic lines. The organic system allows joint
    decision-making and encourages subordinates to voice their opinions. Looking
    back at the factors, the organic organization's strategy is geared toward
    innovativeness and creativity. The computer software industry is a good example
    of one that requires a creative rather than a restrictive system. The
    environment is unstable; with change being the norm rather than the exception.
    Therefore, an organic system is needed. The size should be small to moderate
    because this type of organization requires loose rules. Technology is fairly
    new with outcomes that are unknown, requiring adaptation rather than
    compliance. The organic system lends itself well to research and development
    organizations that are creative rather than restrictive. The strengths of an
    organic organization lie within communication. The sharing of information and
    participative environment increase worker satisfaction and often produce
    wellrounded decisions. Unfortunately, the organic design's communication slows
    down the implementation process. This slow response leads to low efficiency. In
    addition, the organic organization's flexibility reduces standards. In other
    words, if the same task is performed every three months, they may be handled
    differently each time.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30933"><span id="SPAN-30934">21.4.3.
    There are very few organizations that are purely mechanistic or organic. For
    this reason, we have another design that incorporates the strengths of both,
    the&nbsp;<b id="B-30935">diverse</b>&nbsp;design. This design is used when the organization
    needs the rigid structure of the mechanistic organization for one section and
    the flexibility of the organic for another. For example, the administrative
    section has specific rules to follow when processing performance reports,
    decorations, and orders. For this purpose, they would require a mechanistic
    system. In the same organization, you may have a section that conducts
    training. The mechanistic system would hinder the creativity required for such
    a section; therefore, an organic system would be more effective. Because the
    organization uses both mechanistic and organic systems to accomplish the
    mission, the organizational design is considered diverse. The diverse
    organization incorporates the best of both designs to accomplish the mission.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30936"><span id="SPAN-30937">21.4.4.
    The last design we will look at is the&nbsp;<b id="B-30938">matrix design</b>. Basically,
    developing a matrix is teaming workers from different sections or organizations
    together to solve problems or serve a function. We do this quite often. The
    disaster preparedness section, mobility section, and process action teams are
    good examples of a matrix. The distinguishing factor in a matrix is the chain
    of command. In the matrix design, subordinates have two bosses. They have their
    functional boss, who writes their performance report and schedules normal duty
    hours, and the project boss or team leader. The strength of the matrix design
    lies in the pooling of expertise and resources, and the weaknesses lie in the
    confusion of who is in charge; the functional or project boss. One note of
    caution; the matrix is not a design in itself. Basically the matrix is a design
    within a design. In other words, an organization designed mechanistically that
    develops a Process Action Team to work a project does not become a matrix.
    Actually, they are a mechanistic organization with a matrix. A matrix is
    usually short-lived, so the overall organizational structure remains intact.</span></p>

    As managers in today's Air Force, your job is to ensure organizations are
    operating at peak performance. One way of accomplishing that responsibility is
    to set up organizations effectively. We need to look at our units from the
    standpoint of our organizational strategy; the environment or an outside
    influence on our organization, the size of our organization, and the technology
    or advances in the equipment we use day to day. Once we understand how these
    factors relate to our organization, we can decide what structure would best
    accomplish our mission. Is the organization geared toward the rigid mechanistic
    structure, the flexible organic structure, a combination (the diverse
    structure), or do we need to use specialized teams to solve a problem as in the
    matrix structure? These are decisions made by the effective leader. By
    designing our organizations properly, we are designing the organization that
    will capitalize on strengths and minimize weaknesses. As you can see,
    organizational design goes much further than the organizational chart.</span></p>

    <p id="P-30948"><span id="SPAN-30949">The British created a
    civil service job in 1803 requiring a man stand on the White Cliffs of Dover
    with a spyglass. He was supposed to ring a bell if he saw Napoleon coming.
    Despite Napoleon's defeat in 1813, the job existed until 1945.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30950"><span id="SPAN-30951">21.5.1.
    What's wrong with this picture? The scenario illustrates an improvement, not to
    mention a significant cost-saving opportunity that was ignored for over 130
    years! We know change is inevitable. We know changes are taking place every
    day, all around us. We know change is easy, right? Wrong! As the scenario above
    shows, change is not automatic and doesn t just happen.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30952"><span id="SPAN-30953">21.5.2.
    Change can be a complicated and often painful process. Senior enlisted leaders
    are in key positions to manage change. They have the authority and
    responsibility to lead and manage organizations, many years of experience, and
    technical proficiency. However, as leaders, they must also become proficient
    organizational change managers.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30954"><span id="SPAN-30955">21.5.3. This section
    explores the change process using the model proposed by renowned social
    psychologist Kurt Lewin, who recommended leaders view change as a three-stage
    process: unfreezing, changing, and refreezing.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30956"><b id="B-30957"><span id="SPAN-30958">21.6. Stage 1: Unfreezing.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-30959"><span id="SPAN-30960">Leaders
    begin organizational change by unfreezing, which means going where the hurt
    is where people feel the pain of poor policies or systems. Organizational
    change is defined as the adoption of a new idea or behavior by an organization
    (Daft, 452); the establishment of new norms. These norms can be grouped in
    various categories, including technology, tasks, structure, and people norms:
    (1) technology:<b id="B-30961"><i id="I-30962">&nbsp;</i></b>computers, test equipment, weapons systems,
    etc.; (2) tasks: general procedures, job steps, checklists, etc.; (3)
    structure: administrative procedures, evaluation systems, etc.; and (4)
    people:&nbsp;technical or leadership training, new jobs, etc.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30963"><span id="SPAN-30964">21.6.1.
    Regardless of what specifically needs to change, the first step is to recognize
    the need for change and this step is far from easy. Change is appropriate when
    there is a perceived gap between what the norms are and what they should be.
    This perception starts the momentum to begin unfreezing.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30965"><span id="SPAN-30966">21.6.2.
    Unfreezing is a deliberate management activity to prepare people for change.
    Leaders create an environment where people feel the need for change. This is
    often the most neglected, yet essential part of unfreezing. A key factor in
    unfreezing involves making people knowledgeable about the importance of a
    change and how it will affect their jobs. Leaders must first generate a need in
    the people who will feel the greatest effect of the change. They do this by
    pointing out the problems or challenges with current operations. In many cases,
    people will want to stick to the old norms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30967"><span id="SPAN-30968">21.6.3.
    The first reaction to change is usually resistance. Just as change is
    inevitable, so is resistance to change. An essential element for successful
    change is having a good plan. Planning enables the change agent to anticipate
    problems, develop courses of action, and deal with resistance. Resistance can
    take many forms. Four of the most common are:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30969"><span id="SPAN-30970">21.6.3.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-30971">Uncertainty.</b>&nbsp;When
    faced with impending change, people often experience fear of the unknown, or
    see the change as a threat to their security: Can I do the new job? Can I
    operate the new equipment? Will I still have a job?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30972"><span id="SPAN-30973">21.6.3.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-30974">Self-interest.</b>&nbsp;People
    often consider the power they currently have or their role in the existing environment
    and question the possible loss of power after the change is implemented.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30975"><span id="SPAN-30976">21.6.3.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-30977">Different
    Perception/No Felt Need to Change.</b>&nbsp;Even if you think people recognize
    the need for change, they may see the situation differently. Outwardly, they
    may support the change, but inwardly, they resist it.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30978"><span id="SPAN-30979">21.6.3.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-30980">Over-Determination.</b>&nbsp;Ironically,
    organization structure may be a barrier to change. For example, a mechanistic
    structure that relies on strict procedure and lines of authority may be so
    rigid that it inhibits change.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-30981"><span id="SPAN-30982">21.6.4.
    When making change, success depends on managing and reducing resistance, and a
    change agent becomes vitally important. Leaders must accept the role of change
    agent in order to manage change. Senior enlisted leaders have vast influence on
    their subordinates, peers, and superiors. Commanders and directors often call
    upon senior noncommissioned officers to change an organization, to  make it
    happen.  Here are five proven methods leaders employ to reduce and manage
    resistance to change:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30983"><span id="SPAN-30984">21.6.4.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-30985">Education
    and Communication.</b>&nbsp;Educating people about the need for, and expected
    results of, a change should reduce their resistance. Open communication is
    necessary throughout the change process and helps reduce uncertainty.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30986"><span id="SPAN-30987">21.6.4.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-30988">Participation
    and Involvement.&nbsp;</b>Leaders reduce resistance by actively involving those
    affected in designing and implementing change. Involving people in the process
    may be time-consuming, but should help commit them to the new program.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30989"><span id="SPAN-30990">21.6.4.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-30991">Facilitation
    and Support.</b>&nbsp;Introduce the change gradually, if possible. Provide
    additional training if needed. Reinforce and encourage people as much as
    possible. Remember the power of high expectations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30992"><span id="SPAN-30993">21.6.4.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-30994">Negotiation
    and Agreement.</b>&nbsp;Offer incentives to those who continue to resist the
    change. Negotiated agreements can help remind everyone of the changes they
    agreed upon should resistance return.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30995"><span id="SPAN-30996">21.6.4.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-30997">Coercion.</b>&nbsp;This
    technique involves using force to get people to accept change. This is a last
    resort because compulsion negatively affects attitudes, and has long-term
    negative consequences. Coerced compliance requires constant leadership
    oversight to ensure the change remains in effect.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-30998"><span id="SPAN-30999">21.6.5.
    There are usually many factors to consider, whether maintaining current norms
    (the status quo) or changing current norms. The change agent must analyze
    restraining (opposing) forces and devise ways to reduce them to overcome
    resistance. At the same time, leaders must recognize and strengthen driving
    (supporting) forces those forces pushing toward change. After analyzing the
    forces for and against change and developing a strategy to deal with them,
    leaders can attend to the change itself. Leaders improve the chance of success
    when they break the change into sequential steps. This approach provides
    visible success early, which may encourage people to support the rest of the
    change program.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31000"><span id="SPAN-31001">21.6.6.
    The unfreezing stage should be addressed whenever change is imminent. Careful
    planning is an essential element of unfreezing, improving chances of success
    and decreasing the likelihood of having to repeat the unfreezing stage. Your
    plan should include a set of evaluation standards to measure the degree of
    success or failure of the change. An evaluation with clear goals and objectives
    can help assess the success of change and help determine appropriate rewards
    when the change has been completed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31002"><b id="B-31003"><span id="SPAN-31004">21.7. Stage 2: Changing.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-31005"><span id="SPAN-31006">This
    stage involves modifying technology, tasks, structure, or distribution of
    people. This is the movement from the old state, or the previous norms, to the
    new state. During the changing stage, the organization installs new equipment,
    restructures work centers, or implements a new performance appraisal system. In
    short, changing is anything that alters the status quo.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31007"><span id="SPAN-31008">21.7.1.
    Your role as change agent in this stage is to monitor the change as it occurs
    and pay close attention to the people most affected by it. If you ve
    implemented the change too early, you ll know it by watching the people s
    reactions. If some link in the system isn t ready to handle the change,
    production may bog down. A few irate callers from other branches or units will
    let you know in a hurry!</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31009"><span id="SPAN-31010">21.7.2.
    In this stage, ensure the plan unfolds as intended. Even the best plans go awry
    for one reason or another. Remember, the importance of you being involved as
    the change is implemented and be ready to deal with problems that may arise.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31011"><span id="SPAN-31012">21.7.3.
    Provide support at this stage. Some people may be traumatized by the actual
    implementation, so you should provide encouragement and advice as needed. The
    same techniques used to overcome resistance to change (paragraph 21.6.4) apply
    here, too.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31013"><span id="SPAN-31014">21.7.4.
    Go back to the unfreezing stage if the change isn t going well. Going back or
    regrouping is better than pressing on with a change that causes more problems
    than it fixes. The change agent must decide whether (and when) to move forward.
    You must keep tabs on things or you won t be in a position to make this
    decision. Don t just plan to change, flip the switch, and let the chips fall
    where they may.</span></p>

    <p id="P-31024"><b id="B-31025"><span id="SPAN-31026">21.8. Stage 3: Refreezing.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-31027"><span id="SPAN-31028">The
    final stage in the change process is refreezing. Just because you implemented a
    change and it appears to be going smoothly doesn t mean the job is done. You
    must lock in (or refreeze) the desired outcomes and the new norms so they
    become permanent.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31029"><span id="SPAN-31030">21.8.1.
    Without refreezing, people often return to the old ways. Consider an Airman who
    completes 7-skill level upgrade training and learns the proper way to perform
    key tasks in his or her work center. The proper way may differ from the way the
    work center completes the tasks. The Airman may be inclined to conform to the
    old way rather than make waves:&nbsp;old behaviors take over and nothing
    changes. Actively encouraging the use of new techniques and reinforcing them
    encourages others to use them, essentially freezing the new behavior. A
    critical step in refreezing is evaluating results. Did the change have the
    desired effect? If so, press on. If not, the new process may need more support,
    instruction, training, time, etc.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31031"><span id="SPAN-31032">21.8.2.
    Having developed strategies to evaluate results in Stage 1 of the change
    process, now is time to implement them. Positively reinforcing desired outcomes
    is crucial. Reward people when they do something right; this strengthens the
    correct behaviors and helps freeze them into place. In many cases, the change
    agent can call attention to the success of the change and show where it works.
    Highlighting successful change helps remove lingering resistance and prevents
    people from returning to the old way of doing things.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31033"><span id="SPAN-31034">21.8.3.
    In some cases, even what appears to be successful change management fails in
    the end. Years ago, a company bought new computer equipment for the typing
    pool, replacing the old electric typewriters with word processing stations. The
    new technology included color monitors, advanced software, and high-speed
    printers. Everyone was carefully trained. The new equipment was installed for
    half the typists at first, then the other half got their new equipment, and the
    supervisors (change agents) provided support and encouragement all the way.
    Soon the section was turning out professional correspondence in half the time
    it previously took. Successful change, you say. Unfortunately, it wasn t. To
    cut down on the noise from the printers, portable dividers were installed
    between workstations. This isolated the typists from coworkers, who used to be
    able to converse back and forth unimpeded. As a result, the previous social
    system, which was one of harmony, turned into one of unhappy isolation. Both
    the people and the work suffered, and the change plan had to be modified.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31035"><span id="SPAN-31036">21.8.4.
    Do you think the change agents anticipated this outcome and planned for it?
    Probably not, but they really weren t at fault. After all, no one can anticipate
    everything. The example serves to remind us of the importance of refreezing.
    The change agent must evaluate results, reinforce the desired outcomes, and
    make constructive modifications as needed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31037"><span id="SPAN-31038">21.8.5.
    A change agent has a tough job. Carefully planning change; however, can make it
    as painless as possible. Managing change is one of the most important
    responsibilities you have. Using this three-stage process can help you manage
    the inevitable changes, rather than letting the changes manage you.</span></p>

    <p id="P-31043"><b id="B-31044"><span id="SPAN-31045">21.9. Introduction.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-31046"><span id="SPAN-31047">Conflict
    is inevitable in every organization, and is often necessary to reach high
    levels of performance. Dr. Kenneth Thomas, author of&nbsp;<i id="I-31048">Conflict and
    Conflict Management, the Handbook of Industrial and Organization
    Psychology&nbsp;</i>(1976), defines conflict as the  process that results when
    one person (or a group) perceives that another person or group is frustrating,
    or about to frustrate, an important concern.  Conflict involves incompatible
    differences between parties that result in interference or opposition. Such
    differences can motivate for positive change or decrease productivity.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31049"><span id="SPAN-31050">21.9.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-31051">Destructive Versus Constructive
    Conflict.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31052"><span id="SPAN-31053">Conflict
    can be constructive or destructive and becomes destructive when it results in
     barriers' to cooperation and communication. This destroys morale and diverts
    energy away from important tasks and initiatives. On the other hand, conflict
    can be constructive when managed effectively. Positive conflict results in
    problem solutions, greater understanding, and enhanced communication between
    individuals or groups. In the past, managers were trained to avoid conflict
    because of its negative repercussions. This continues to challenge managers
    today as they work feverishly to avoid it altogether. However, managing
    conflict effectively offers benefits to the organization like reducing
    organizational chaos and stimulating work activity and productivity. Therefore,
    to manage conflict successfully, we must first understand some of the sources
    of conflict.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31054"><span id="SPAN-31055">21.9.2.<b id="B-31056">&nbsp;Sources of Conflict.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31057"><span id="SPAN-31058">Many
    factors may result in or increase the probability of conflict within an
    organization. These factors manifest themselves in combination with other
    factors, making it potentially difficult to identify the specific source of the
    conflict. Many researchers, however, agree that conflict originates with one or
    more of the following stimulants:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31059"><span id="SPAN-31060">21.9.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-31061">Communication
    Factors<i id="I-31062">.&nbsp;</i></b>We often hear that many problems occur due to a
    failure in, or a lack of, communication. However, on closer examination, this
    usually accounts for a very small portion of the conflicts reported. The real
    crux of the problem is miscommunication; for example, when communication is
    misinterpreted, inaccurate, or incomplete. For personnel to perform at their
    very best, they need constructive, comprehensible, and accurate information;
    anything less results in frustration, stress, and failure. Remember, conflict
    is defined as frustration of an important concern, whether real or perceived.
    Consider your organization and the conflicts that erupted because of poor
    communication. Now consider what happens when the communication process fails
    altogether. Did the outcomes result in conflict?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31063"><span id="SPAN-31064">21.9.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-31065">Structural Factors:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31066"><span id="SPAN-31067">21.9.2.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-31068">Size.&nbsp;</b>Research
    shows that organizational size affects the people who work there. Like an
    elevator that reaches its maximum capacity, the larger the organization, the
    more people there is to cause and participate in conflict. With more personnel
    comes more opinions, perspectives, perceptions, etc. As a result, larger
    organizations may have unclear goals, more rigid structures, increased
    specialization, more levels of supervision, and increased opportunities for
    information to become distorted as it passes through each organizational
    echelon.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31069"><span id="SPAN-31070">21.9.2.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-31071">Participation:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31072"><span id="SPAN-31073">21.9.2.2.2.1.
    The more people interact and participate, the more noticeable their differences
    become. This can also lead to disputes and conflict, partly because although
    people may attempt to participate does not necessarily mean their ideas are
    heard or accepted. This rejection can spark frustration and conflict among
    members. However, this situation also has the potential to increase
    productivity if workers become more creative or competitive and search for better
    ways to enhance overall unit performance. This is productive conflict versus
    destructive conflict.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31074"><span id="SPAN-31075">21.9.2.2.2.2.
    We want people to challenge the status quo, to seek better ways to do business,
    and to continually improve processes. This supports our core value,&nbsp;<i id="I-31076">excellence
    in all we do.&nbsp;</i>Such efforts also support our&nbsp;<i id="I-31077">service before
    self&nbsp;</i>core value, in that we must be willing to set aside old ways and
    personal differences in order to listen to the ideas of others, to include our
    newest Airman. We must be willing to change, put self-interests aside, and do
    what is right for the Air Force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31078"><span id="SPAN-31079">21.9.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-31080">Line-Staff
    Distinctions.&nbsp;</b>Diverse backgrounds and roles can create conflict.
    According to Dr. Thomas, this is very noticeable in the line and staff
    functions because the roles are so different. Overall, line personnel are
    concerned with production and are usually more loyal to the company. Staff
    functions usually involve creativity; therefore, staff personnel are usually
    more critical of the organization. Moreover, since there are usually different
    requirements for staff and line functions, there are different types of
    backgrounds for each. These differences in values, training, background, etc.,
    can lead to conflict. Consider how line and staff personnel view organizational
    goals. Line personnel normally are more concerned with the immediate or
    short-range goals, whereas staff personnel are more concerned with long-range
    or strategic goals. These differences in background and viewpoints can trigger
    conflict.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31081"><span id="SPAN-31082">21.9.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-31083">Rewards.&nbsp;</b>Earning
    rewards involves a level of competition, which can lead to conflict. Healthy
    competition is not the problem. However, the individuals and groups who
    perceive that the rewards were given unfairly or in favor of someone else can
    often lead to conflict. For example, one person or department receives
    recognition that others feel they deserved but did not receive.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31084"><span id="SPAN-31085">21.9.2.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-31086">Resource
    Interdependence.</b>&nbsp;Most likely, we have all had to compete for resources
    at one time or another. When people compete for scarce resources and each party
    feels they have a greater need, conflict may arise. Oftentimes, negotiations
    fail as each party assumes a directive, or authoritarian position as they
    compete for the resource.</span></p>

    values are questioned, criticized, or opposed, conflict can result. Some
    values, such as religion and politics, seem to incite the biggest arguments and
    can lead to fights, but even less emotion-based values can cause conflict. For
    example, a worker who values high quality work may see him or herself due a
    reward for the quality of the work. Conflict may occur if the unit emphasizes
    quantity over quality and rewards someone else instead.</span></p>

    also affect how people perceive situations and other people. If a person
    perceives others as lazy and incompetent, how he or she responds to that
    perception may cause problems. A person's perception of what constitutes
    fairness, quality of work, or constructive techniques can lead to conflict if
    these perceptions differ significantly from others or what the organization has

    are asking for conflict. Two personality types especially conflict-prone are
    the highly authoritarian individual and the low self-esteem individual. The
    highly authoritarian personality may antagonize coworkers by escalating
    otherwise trivial differences. The low selfesteem personality may feel
    threatened by others and therefore overreact. Either type of behavior can
    create interpersonal conflict in an organization.</span></p>

    <p id="P-31105"><span id="SPAN-31106">21.10.1.
    Now that we have an idea of what conflict is and what causes it, we can examine
    some ways to manage it. In the book,  <i id="I-31107"><u id="U-31108">Conflict and Negotiation Processes
    in Organizations,</u>  Handbook of Industrial and Organizational
    Psychology&nbsp;</i>(1992),Dr. Thomas suggests five major conflict management
    styles: competing (or forcing), collaborating, accommodating, avoiding, and
    compromising. Dr. Thomas uses a two-dimensional framework to compare these styles.
    The first dimension refers to the degree of cooperation a manager exhibits,
    measuring from uncooperative to cooperative. The second dimension measures
    assertiveness on a scale from nonassertive (passive) to assertive (active).
    Being cooperative refers to how willing a person or group is to satisfy the
    other's needs. For example, if Person A gives into the needs of Person B,
    Person A is considered cooperative. If Person A assumes a  my way or the
    highway  approach, he or she is considered uncooperative.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31109"><span id="SPAN-31110">21.10.2.
    From these two dimensions, we can devise a way to manage conflict based on the
    situation. Just as situational leadership is based on task and relationship
    behavior, conflict management is situational and is based on assertive and
    cooperative behavior. With this in mind, let's look at the five styles used to
    manage conflict.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31111"><span id="SPAN-31112">21.10.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-31113">Competing
    (or Forcing).<i id="I-31114">&nbsp;</i></b>This style attempts to overwhelm an opponent with
    formal authority, threats, or the use of power. Its underlying features are
    being highly assertive and uncooperative.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31115"><span id="SPAN-31116">21.10.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-31117">Collaborating.<i id="I-31118">&nbsp;</i></b>The
    collaborating style involves an attempt to satisfy the concerns of both sides
    through honest discussion. Creative approaches to conflict reduction, such as
    sharing resources, may actually lead to both parties being materially better
    off. For this style to be successful, trust and openness are required of all
    participants. This style is high in assertive behavior and high in cooperation
    and seeks a win position for both groups.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31119"><span id="SPAN-31120">21.10.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-31121">Accommodating.&nbsp;</b>The
    accommodating style combines low assertiveness and high cooperation. At the
    simplest level, this style may merely involve giving in to another person s
    wishes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31122"><span id="SPAN-31123">21.10.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-31124">Avoiding:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31125"><span id="SPAN-31126">21.10.2.4.1.
    The combination of low assertiveness and low cooperation leads to an avoiding
    style. The person implies that he or she will appear to be neutral and it may
    not always be possible to adopt a truly neutral position, but a manager may
    nonetheless prefer to avoid the situation. Although a manager who avoids difficult
    issues is likely to be resented by his or her Airmen, this strategy may be
    effective under certain circumstances. For example, a manager may initially
    stay out of a disagreement to avoid escalating the conflict during a particular
    phase of development. Later, when he or she judges the time is right, the
    manager may take a more active role in finding a productive solution.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31127"><span id="SPAN-31128">21.10.2.4.2.
    Experienced managers recognize that action is not always necessary because some
    problems dissipate over time or are resolved by other organizational processes.
    For example, an intense conflict between two Airmen may seem to require
    intervention by their manager. If the manager knows that one of the individuals
    will soon be transferred to another department or promoted to another position,
    ignoring the situation and letting the impending changes resolve the difficulty
    may be the best solution.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31129"><span id="SPAN-31130">21.10.2.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-31131">Compromising.&nbsp;</b>This
    style involves intermediate degrees of assertiveness and cooperation to
    partially satisfy both parties' desires and achieve a middle ground. To
    successfully compromise, both parties must be willing to give up something.
    Compromising is common during labor and management disputes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31132"><b id="B-31133"><span id="SPAN-31134">21.11. Applying Conflict Management Style:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-31135"><span id="SPAN-31136">21.11.1.<b id="B-31137">&nbsp;</b>When
    deciding which style of conflict management to use, consider a few additional
    factors. First, consider who you are dealing with. When dealing with a
    supervisor or a peer, the competing style of conflict management may not be
    applicable. Also, doubtful any of us could force our commander in a conflict
    situation. On the other hand, competing may work for a subordinate. You have
    the legitimate power to enforce a policy. So knowing&nbsp;<b id="B-31138"><i id="I-31139">who&nbsp;</i></b>is
    important in deciding the style you can use.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31140"><span id="SPAN-31141">21.11.2.
    Another factor is determining how critical the issue is, also known as
    the&nbsp;<b id="B-31142"><i id="I-31143">stakes</i></b>. If the issue is critical, you may wish to use
    the avoiding style at first to carefully consider the options or gather more
    data. However, because the issue is critical, you cannot avoid it for long.
    Sooner or later, you will have to confront the issue. Also, if the situation is
    critical and you know you are right, you may need to use the competing style to
    force your position. Conversely, if the issue is trivial, you could avoid it or
    even accommodate the other party. Remember to always consider the&nbsp;<b id="B-31144"><i id="I-31145">stakes&nbsp;</i></b>in
    the issue.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31146"><span id="SPAN-31147">21.11.3.
    The final factor is the&nbsp;<b id="B-31148"><i id="I-31149">situation&nbsp;</i></b>itself. In an
    emergency, the competing style might be necessary because there simply is not
    enough time to collaborate or compromise. You also cannot avoid an emergency.
    However, if time is not an issue and the parties are willing to discuss the
    matter, collaboration may be the best way to deal with the conflict situation
    because it works best for everyone.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31150"><span id="SPAN-31151">21.11.4.
    Although people may consider some styles of conflict management more effective
    (for example, collaborating versus avoiding), all of the conflict management
    styles are useful, depending on who, the stakes, and the situation. Using these
    five styles allows us to successfully manage conflict, reduce disorder and
    chaos, and facilitate creativity and innovative problem solving. Being a
    conflict management specialist<i id="I-31152">&nbsp;</i>is just another one of the many
    responsibilities of managers!</span></p>

    <p id="P-31260"><span id="SPAN-31261">21.15.1.1.&nbsp;The critical first step to effective
    problemsolving is to clearly understand the problem. A problem solving effort
    that begins with  We all know what the problem is, so just get it fixed now? 
    sets us up for failure before we begin. This  fly by the seat of your pants
    approach  leads to several errors. First, because the  obvious solution  is
    often based purely on the experience level of the problem solver, which
    misdiagnose the underlying problem. Secondly, this mindset is closed to the
    possibility of innovative solutions which are better suited to solving the real
    problem. A well-defined problem statement uses data to identify where the
    problem is occurring and impact of the problem, and compares performance
    against a standard with scope and direction. The statement does not make</span></p>

    <p id="P-31264"><span id="SPAN-31265">21.15.1.2.
    The Who, What, When, Where, and significance of the problem statement should be
    validated by data. This is done by collecting and analyzing data to both
    validate the existence and magnitude of the problem. If data does not exist,
    the effort should be paused to collect and analyze the needed data&nbsp;<i id="I-31266">before</i>&nbsp;moving

    Once the problem has been clearly identified and answers the Who, What, When,
    and Where of the problem statement, efforts are made to further analyze the
    data in comparison to the voice of the customer. The voice of the customer
    gives the standard to measure from. The delta between the current state
    (otherwise known as the voice of the process) and voice of the customer will
    highlight opportunities for improvements (also called the performance gap).

    <p id="P-31301"><span id="SPAN-31302">Air
    Force leaders often find themselves addressing problems which have been
     solved  many times because previous problem-solving efforts were directed
    at&nbsp;<i id="I-31303">symptoms&nbsp;</i>of a problem rather than the&nbsp;<i id="I-31304">root cause</i>&nbsp;of
    the problem. If an aircraft is constantly breaking down and cannot perform its
    mission, should the goal be to reduce aircraft usage, improve repair cycle
    time, improve the quality of replacement parts, improve the aircraft design, or
    improve the aircraft design process? Each step becomes increasingly difficult
    to evaluate, but each step also has a greater impact in the elimination of the
    problem. Root cause analysis is a tradeoff between digging as deeply as
    possible and finding the deepest point still within the team's sphere of
    influence. The correct root cause should be validated by using the same data
    used to define the problem in Step 1. Tools to consider for Step 4 are 5 Whys,
    brainstorming, Pareto Chart, Affinity diagram, fishbone diagram, and control
    charts.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31305"><span id="SPAN-31306">21.15.5.<b id="B-31307">&nbsp;Step 5 Develop Countermeasures:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31308"><span id="SPAN-31309">21.15.5.1.
    Step 5 is where process changes that directly corrects, influences, affects
    each of your root causes are developed. Air Force leaders should follow
    important guidelines to ensure the greatest likelihood of success. A key
    principle to remember is that the impact of a solution is a combination of the
    quality of the solution and the acceptance of the solution by the people who
    must implement it. The relationship is similar to the following formula:
    (Quality of the solution) x (Acceptance) = Impact. Also, when developing countermeasures
    strive for process improvement change that is sustainable and repeatable.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31310"><span id="SPAN-31311">21.15.5.2.
    Address potential root causes with countermeasures which conform to lean
    principles and are the most practical and effective,  keep it simple.  Validate
    countermeasures will close performance gaps when implemented. Countermeasures
    should move the organization closer to the ideal state and support strategic
    plans. Also recommended is to build consensus, when possible and appropriate,
    with all stakeholders involved.&nbsp;Judiciously involving stakeholders
    in the development of countermeasures sponsors ownership of the solution and
    its success. At the end of this step, obtain a vector check from the champion
    to ensure strategic alignment.&nbsp;The champion approves the countermeasures
    prior to implementation. Tools to consider for Step 5 are Sort, Straighten,
    Shine, Standardize, Sustain; brainstorming; multi-voting; Possible, Implement,
    Challenge, Kill Chart; errorproofing; standard work; cell/flow design; and
    Future State Map.</span></p>

    all tasks status until countermeasures have been implemented or deemed
    unnecessary as target state has been met. Devoting time and resources towards
    developing an action plan without action should be considered waste. Tools to
    consider for Step 6 are Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, Sustain; visual
    management, standard work, cell/flow design, variation reduction,

    management? I'm not in the plans and programs business; so why should I worry
    about managing a project?"&nbsp;These are questions which may be on

    likelihood of taking positions in the future which will or do involve the sound
    management of a multitude of resources. Even if you are not involved in the
    management of a long-term project involving millions of dollars' worth of

    <p id="P-31398"><span id="SPAN-31399">Project
    management uses a unique array of terminology to communicate its principles and
    use. The first term we should probably clear up right away is the term
    "project management." According to Hersey and Blanchard in their
    book&nbsp;<i id="I-31400">Management&nbsp;</i>of&nbsp;<i id="I-31401">Organizational Behavior,&nbsp;</i>management
    is defined as the process of working with and through individuals and groups
    and other resources to accomplish organizational goals (Hersey and Blanchard:
    5). In their book,&nbsp;<i id="I-31402">Successful Project Managers,&nbsp;</i>Jeffrey K.
    Pinto and O.P. Kharbanda define project as a combination of human and non-human
    resources pulled together in a temporary organization to achieve a specified
    purpose (Pinto and Kharbanda: 13). Although there are many definitions to
    choose from, for the purpose of this reading we'll use Pinto and Kharbanda's
    definition of project management: the process of leading, coordinating,
    planning, and controlling a diverse and complex set of processes and people in
    the pursuit of achieving project objectives (Pinto and Kharbanda: 17). With
    this definition in mind, it may be worthy to examine what project management is
    not. A project is not a program; programs are ongoing. A project, by
    definition, is something temporary. Although temporary could be in terms of
    years, a project is unlike a program. You are involved with many programs in
    your work centers, and programs are ongoing. A project has a single objective,
    which has some time frame attached to it. Armed with project management's basic
    definition, we can now expand on project management's other terms.</span></p>

    Before you can complete Step 1 of project management, you have to ensure the
    problem or improvement opportunity is clearly defined by the project objective.
    You might say that an objective is simply a goal, but in reality, when it comes
    to project management, an objective has to be more specific than a typical
    broad goal. According to Marion E. Haynes in her book,&nbsp;<i id="I-31477">Project
    Management: From Idea to Implementation,&nbsp;</i>good objectives are SMART.
    SMART is an acronym, which stands for Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented,

    <p id="P-31478"><span id="SPAN-31479">21.17.2.1. Specific

    <p id="P-31482"><span id="SPAN-31483">21.17.2.3.
    Action-oriented by using statements that have action-tense verbs and are

    passive voice.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31484"><span id="SPAN-31485">21.17.2.4. Realistic

    For example, "Accomplish the renovation of the office area" would be
    an example of a goal you wish to achieve. A SMART objective for such a goal
    might be: "Renovate the office area by June 30, 200X at a cost not to
    exceed $12,000." By specifying the objective of the project, you can now
    determine the constraints you have to operate under.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31490"><span id="SPAN-31491">21.17.4.
    Constraints are numerous for all activities we endeavor, but constraint
    consideration is crucial for project management. According to Geoff Reiss in
    his book,&nbsp;<i id="I-31492">Project Management Demystified,&nbsp;</i>quality, time, and
    cost are the main constraints realized in project management. Quality refers to
    being in accordance with the requirement - the specifications. Time refers to
    the amount of time you have to complete the project. Cost, of course, refers to
    your resource constraints, to include the four M's necessary to complete the
    project: money, manpower, machinery, and materials. One of these constraints
    (Quality, Time, and Cost) will be your driver for the project (Reiss: 39). To
    understand the meaning of driver, let's examine some of National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration's projects. In the 1960s, a manned vehicle called
    Sputnik broke through the earth's atmosphere, and the space race began. In an
    effort to catch-up, time became a driver for National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration's project to launch a man into space. The amount of money spent
    or the quality of the materials, although important, did not drive the project.
    However, during the 1980s, the explosion of the Challenger caused National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration to change drivers. Now quality became the
    driver for future projects. The driver for your project will have an impact on
    the other two constraints affecting your project. Ensure you take this into
    consideration when making decisions about your project's objective. If time is
    the driver, the T of your SMART objective needs to be reflective of that
    driving influence. If quality is your driver, the S of your SMART objective
    needs to be predominant. How will quality being your driver affect the other
    constraints? Quality increases the amount of time taken and increases the
    expense of materials. You must always remain cognizant of the impact one
    constraint has on another and adjust the management of your project
    accordingly. Ultimately, your driver and affected constraints will have an
    impact on the solutions you develop. As the project manager, it is incumbent
    upon you to provide the leadership and use good team-building techniques to
    establish a sound project objective and generate the solution options necessary
    to achieve those objectives. Once these steps have been completed, it will then
    be time to embark upon the most important and timeconsuming aspect of project
    management planning.</span></p>

    As indicated earlier, planning the project involves answering several
    questions. The first of those questions is: what must be done? The answer is
    contained in the objective of the project, but more specifics are needed.
    Haynes states that the starting place for answering the question of what must
    be done is by using a work breakdown structure. A work breakdown structure is a
    technique based on dividing a project into sub-units, or work packages. Since
    all the elements required to complete the project are identified in the work
    breakdown structure, the chances of neglecting or overlooking an essential step
    are minimized. A work breakdown structure is typically constructed with two or
    three levels of detail, although more levels are quite common depending on the
    complexity of the project (Haynes: 25). To illustrate using an elementary
    example, Figure 21.2 depicts a work breakdown structure for a typical yard
    project. Granted, a work breakdown structure would not usually be constructed
    for such a project, but to illustrate the concept, it is best to use something
    very simple to start with.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-31495"><span id="SPAN-31496">21.17.6.
    Graphically, you can quickly ascertain the necessary tasks to complete the
    project. Such a structure for your project will permit you, and others who see
    the work breakdown structure, to readily identify what needs to be done, spot
    omissions which might later affect the outcome of the project, and make
    suggestions for improving and expanding the work breakdown structure. How much
    is too much detail? According to Lewis, the general guideline is that you stop
    breaking down the work when you reach a point at which you can estimate to the
    desired degree of accuracy, or at which the work will take an amount of time
    equal to the smallest units you want to schedule (Lewis: 41 ). Taking Figure
    21.2's work breakdown structure as an example, although the  trim hedge 
    element of the project is an element that needs to be included as part of the
    work breakdown structure, it is not necessary to further indicate whether the
    hedge should be squared or rounded, done from left to right or top to bottom,
    etc. The amount of breakdown is an element the project manager and the project
    team must decide upon. Once the work breakdown structure has been tweaked and
    finalized, the next step is task analysis.</span></p>

    needed for the task analysis depends on the task involved and the desires of
    the project manager and project team. The more complex the project, the greater
    the importance of detailed task analysis. Figure 21.3 depicts a typical task
    analysis and details considered using our elementary example task pertaining to
    the yard project. As you can see from the example, a wealth of&nbsp;</span><sub id="SUB-31518"><span id="SPAN-31519">&nbsp;</span></sub><span id="SPAN-31520">information is contained
    about the</span></p>

    work&nbsp;breakdown&nbsp;structure,&nbsp;to
    include task milestones, more specific information of how the milestones can be
    measured, and identification of dependent tasks, budgetary concerns, task assignments,
    and reporting requirements. As the project manager, you can delegate the task
    analysis for each task to the appropriate person. Once they are compiled, you
    can make final decisions on task assignments and budgetary concerns. The task
    analysis is what provides the crucial information for determining how the tasks
    of the project interrelate. For example, in the case of the yard project, the
    tasks associated with preparing the equipment must be completed prior to any of
    the other tasks being accomplished. There is no sense in accomplishing cleanup
    if you haven't done any of the work yet. Although this example may seem to be
    common sense, when larger projects are in the planning stage, it is imperative
    the proper sequencing of tasks occurs prior to beginning a project to ensure
    the efficiency of the project. You wouldn't want carpet installed in your home
    prior to painting the ceiling and the walls, right? Once a task analysis has
    been performed on all tasks associated with the project, the next phase of
    project management, scheduling, must be conducted.</span></p>

    The advent of computer software has made scheduling tasks for projects much
    easier than it used to be. According to Lewis, until around 1958, the only tool
    for scheduling projects was the bar chart (Lewis: 50). Figure 21.4 below
    depicts a simple bar chart constructed from a word-processing software package
    using a table. As you can see, the time taken to complete a task is depicted
    graphically as one of the dark colored bars in 5-minute increments.&nbsp;</span></p>

    Lewis indicates that prior to the advent of project management software,
    similar charts were used. Chart such as the one depicted in Figure 21.4., above
    were called Gantt charts, named after Henry Gantt, the developer of this
    notational system. Until the advent of computer software packages, Gantt charts
    had one serious drawback determining the impact of a slip of one task, on the
    rest of the project was very difficult. To overcome this problem, two methods
    of scheduling were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s that used arrow
    diagrams to capture the sequential and parallel relationships among project
    activities. One method was called critical path method, developed by DuPont;
    the other, performance evaluation and review technique, was developed by the
    Navy and the Booze, Allen and Hamilton Consulting Group. The major difference
    between the two methods is the ability performance evaluation and review
    technique has to calculate the probability that an activity will be completed
    by a certain time, whereas critical path method does not (Lewis: 51). It is
    important to point out that critical path method is a method of scheduling used
    when the time for completing each task of the project is well known, whereas
    performance evaluation and review technique is used when task durations within
    a project (usually a large project) are unknown or difficult to predict. For
    example, in the case of the yard project, if you had performed the various
    tasks before, you would be able to accurately estimate the amount of time it
    would take to complete the tasks based upon your own personal experience.
    Therefore, critical path method would be a simpler method for scheduling.
    However, in the case of a large project where estimates are not based upon
    personal experience, performance evaluation and review technique might be a
    more appropriate method for scheduling. According to Haynes, a way to deal with
    the lack of precision in estimating time is to use a commonly accepted formula
    for the task. The estimate is derived in the following way (Figure 21.5.):</span></p>

    determined for each sub-unit of the project, the next step is to determine the
    earliest and latest starting times for each sub-unit (Haynes: 31). Both
    critical path method and performance evaluation and review technique methods
    are used for what is termed network analysis. According to Reiss, network analysis
    is simply breaking down any project into activities or tasks and then deciding
    how long each task will take and how each of these activities relate to one
    another. From this data, you calculate the timing of each element and predict
    which activities or tasks are vital to the success of the project (Reiss: 46).
    The analysis (a simple graphical expansion of the task analysis) is depicted
    using bar charts, critical path method, performance evaluation and review
    technique, or a combination of the three. For critical path method and
    performance evaluation and review technique, a common convention used is called
    activity on arrow or precedence. For the purpose of this reading, we will refer
    to the technique as strictly&nbsp;<i id="I-33511">precedence.&nbsp;</i>To better understand
    this technique, the following series of diagrams and accompanying explanation
    is provided. In Figure 21.6 below, the precedence, or task to be accomplished,
    is indicated on the line between the two circles. According to Reiss, the words
    written above the line describe the task and are known as the task description.
    This task or activity (precedence) takes a certain period of time. We call the
    circles&nbsp;<i id="I-33512">events&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<i id="I-33513">nodes,&nbsp;</i>and they illustrate
    the completion or the beginning of events. Reiss goes on to say that the circles
    can also be squares, diamonds, or a variety of other symbols, depending on what
    technique is being employed (Reiss: 49).</span></p>

    <p id="P-33521"><span id="SPAN-33522">21.17.11. To expand this concept a little, let's take a look at a
    slightly more involved&nbsp;example. In Figure 21.7 below, we see an
    example of how the precedence of  open&nbsp;garage door  must occur
    before the next two separate events can begin or reach&nbsp;completion.
    In other words, for event 4 to take place (the beginning of
    the&nbsp;precedence's get the car out and get the bike out); the prior
    precedence  open garage&nbsp;door  must take place. When a task must be
    completed before other tasks can begin, that task is said to be a&nbsp;<i id="I-33523">dependency</i>&nbsp;task,
    or&nbsp;<i id="I-33524">predecessor&nbsp;</i>task. According to Reiss, the</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33525"><span id="SPAN-33526">completion
    of events like 5 &amp; 6,  get the bike out  and  get the car out , are
    dependent upon the task  open garage door , and therefore follow  open garage
    door . These succeeding tasks are independent of each other in the diagram. In
    other words, they can be accomplished independently of each other (provided the
    same person is not accomplishing both tasks) (Reiss: 50). Tasks that are
    independent of each other can be performed simultaneously if adequate resources
    are available.</span></p>

    task. When a network diagram&nbsp;is drawn containing nodes connected by
    tasks labeled with&nbsp;durations, the time each task should happen can
    be calculated&nbsp;by adding up the durations of the various routes
    contained&nbsp;within a network. Normally one of these routes will take

    The critical path is identified by the bold-faced box borders and the arrows
    that lead into and out of them. As you can see from the upper left box labeled
    XYZ PROJECT, the project is to take 22 days, assuming the critical path
    durations do not change (Task 1.1 of 5 days + Task 1.3 of 5 days + Task 1.6 of
    7 days + Task 1.9 of 4 days + Project Review of 1 day = 22 days). Whether you
    choose, network diagramming like that depicted in Figures 21.7 and 21.8 or a
    Gantt chart is insignificant. The important thing to remember is that the tool
    used should be simple to read and user friendly for your project. For the
    purpose of the remainder of this reading, we will use a Gantt chart to
    graphically depict further project discussions. Most project management
    software packages make use of Gantt charts, but even if you do not have access
    to project management software, Gantt charts can be easily constructed manually
    in most word processing and spreadsheet programs. Figure 21.10 below is a Gantt
    chart from a popular software package that depicts the information displayed previously
    in Figures 21.8 &amp; 21.9.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33561"><span id="SPAN-33562">21.17.15. The critical
    path in Figure 21.10 is identified by those tasks whose task names are larger,
    bold-faced and underlined in the column labeled Task Name. As indicated
    earlier, the critical path is vital to task completion, so the tasks along this
    path should receive the most attention during the length of the project. Reiss
    indicates that activities off the critical path have some freedom of movement
    without affecting the overall project. These tasks are said to have float or
    slack. The amount of float is the amount of time the activity can be delayed
    without affecting the project overall. Critical tasks have no float, and may
    become critical when their float is entirely consumed by the passage of time.
    There are two types of float <i id="I-33563">free float&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i id="I-33564">total
    float.&nbsp;</i>Total float is what we have been talking about thus far the
    amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the project's end date
    (Reiss: 52). (NOTE: In the following examples, the Gantt chart depicted is for
    a work schedule of Monday through Friday, with weekends being non-duty days.)
    For example, in Figure 21.10 below, task 1.2 has 2 days of total float. Since
    it is not along the critical path, if it was to be delayed by 2 days, it would
    still not cause task 1.6 to be delayed from occurring; thus, its delay would
    not affect the critical path or the project. Free float is the amount of time a
    task can be delayed without affecting any tasks at all. Task 1.2 causes the
    delay of task 1.4; therefore, it has no free float because a delay of this task
    affects another task. However, task 1.4 has free float for if it was delayed by
    as much as 2 days, its delay would not have any effect on the accomplishment of
    another task. Why? Because task 1.3 must be accomplished before tasks 1.5, 1.6,
    and 1.7 can occur. Since task 1.3 is 5 days and 1.4 is 3 days, if 1.4 was to
    start 2 days late and still finish in 3 days, it would not hold up the tasks,
    which are also waiting on the completion of task 1.3. That extra 2 days is called
    task 1.4's free float. Float (or slack) is a concept which is very beneficial
    to a project manager. For example, suppose task 1.3 (a critical task) was
    accomplished by a team of folks. If a couple of team members were unable to
    perform for some reason (emergency leave, hospitalization, etc.), task 1.4
    could be delayed and personnel from the team accomplishing that task could be
    used for task 1.3. Another possibility might be that computers used for
    accomplishment of task 1.3 have failed and task 1.4 could be delayed to permit
    the computer resources to be used for task 1.3. Knowledge of task duration,
    resources to accomplish the task, and float available for tasks can enable a
    project manager to make sound decisions to keep the project on schedule or to even
    shorten the time required to complete the project.</span></p>

    There is a multitude of information available on project management. We have
    attempted to introduce you to some of the terminology, expound on some project
    management principles, and illustrate practical uses of project management
    principles. Remember, project management and program management are not the
    same thing. Unlike a program, a project is temporary, not ongoing. Project
    management is the process of leading and managing processes and people in the
    pursuit of achieving project objectives. The steps of project management
    include defining the problem, developing solution options, planning the
    project, executing the plan, monitoring and controlling progress, and closing
    the project. Project objectives should be SMART   specific, measurable,
    action-oriented, realistic, and time-limited. For project management, the
    primary constraints are quality, time, and cost. Of these three constraints,
    one of them will likely be the driver for a project. The driver of a project
    will have an impact on the other constraints affecting the project. As a
    project manager, you must remain constantly aware of the driver and how it
    impacts the other constraints of the project. With the constraints in mind, it
    is imperative for the project manager to provide sound leadership and
    management to develop the solution options necessary to achieve the project
    objective. Once options are developed, the most important and time-consuming
    aspect of project management must occur planning the project. Planning a
    project involves activities that answer the questions who, what, when, where,
    and how. Techniques of special importance to use during planning are a work
    breakdown schedule, task analysis, and scheduling. Scheduling is accomplished
    in a number of ways, to include Gantt charts, critical path method, and
    performance evaluation and review technique. Gantt, critical path method, and
    performance evaluation and review technique are methods used for network
    analysis. Critical path method and performance evaluation and review technique
    use a common convention called activity on arrow, or precedence. Regardless of
    the method used, the route contained in the diagram depicting the longest duration
    is referred to as the critical path. The completion of the tasks along the
    critical path is vital to the success of the project, and failure of any one of
    those tasks to be completed on time results in a delay to project completion.
    The activities of some tasks off the critical path have some freedom of
    movement without affecting the overall project. These tasks are said to have
    float or slack; the two types of float are total float and free float. Total
    float is the amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the
    project's end.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33596"><span id="SPAN-33597">22.1.1. The concept of
    power in the workforce has a negative connotation and brings to mind such associations
    as coercion, manipulation, and even corruption. This does not have to be the
    case. Power has many positive aspects, and everyone can learn to explore and
    harness different sources of the individual power they have in the workplace.
    By developing their own sources of power, employees will be less dependent on
    others for the leadership they need, and thus be better able to take initiative
    and make greater contributions in their jobs.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33598"><span id="SPAN-33599">22.1.2. Develop your own
    program called&nbsp;<i id="I-33600">Situational Self Leadership</i>, and take a different
    perspective on power. Develop an understanding that  the sole advantage of
    power is the ability to do more good.  Thus, if you want to do more good for
    yourself and more good for the people around you, it is important to learn how
    to tap into your own points of power.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33610"><span id="SPAN-33611">22.2.3.<b id="B-33612">&nbsp;Personal power&nbsp;</b>comes
    from your personal character attributes such as strength of character, passion,
    inspiration, or a personal vision of the future. Personal power is further
    enhanced by the strength of your interpersonal skills, such as your ability to
    communicate well and to be persuasive with others.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33613"><span id="SPAN-33614">22.2.4.<b id="B-33615">&nbsp;Relationship

    by having certain degrees or certifications indicating special training.
    Knowledge power can often be transferred from job to job or from organization
    to organization, and is a general type of power.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33619"><b id="B-33620"><span id="SPAN-33621">22.3. Charting Your Points of Power:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-33622"><span id="SPAN-33623">22.3.1. An enlightening
    activity is to list a number of workplace situations or conditions where you
    feel you have the power to influence outcomes or people. Next to each item,
    categorize the type of power you have in that circumstance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33624"><span id="SPAN-33625">22.3.2. Now draw a
    five-pointed star with ten hash marks from the center to the tip of each point.
    From the center of the star, mark off the corresponding number of responses you
    listed in your assessment of each type of power. The farthest hash mark you
    indicate on each arm of the star becomes the new tip of that arm. Connect these
    new points. The resulting graphic should be some semblance of a star, with
    certain points having more emphasis and others having less. This will show you
    your primary points of power at a glance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33626"><span id="SPAN-33627">22.3.3. If you want to
    be a real star in the workplace, try to develop a strategy to balance the
    points of power where you work. Some examples:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33628"><span id="SPAN-33629">22.3.3.1. You have high
    knowledge power due to expertise in analysis, and are often asked to analyze
    situations and report your findings in meetings. However, you are weak in
    personal power and your ability to communicate is poor. Your strategy might be
    to take a presentation skills course or to ask someone to critique a
    presentation before you give it to the group.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33630"><span id="SPAN-33631">22.3.3.2. You have high
    task power and need to present an idea to the head of your department, but are
    somewhat weak in relationship power. Your strategy could be to ask a coworker
    who has the ear of the department head to give you feedback on how he or she
    thinks the department head will react to your idea.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33632"><span id="SPAN-33633">22.3.3.3. You have task
    power and are working on a very visible project, but you lack position power,
    which might make it difficult to get support. Your strategy could be to use
    your task power to solicit a sponsor or champion who will help promote your
    project and your credibility.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33634"><span id="SPAN-33635">22.3.3.4. You have
    personal power, but are weak in relationship power. Your strategy might be to
    use your social skills to network. Ask others for instructions, attend meetings
    of professional organizations, or schedule lunches to help build relationships.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33636"><span id="SPAN-33637">22.3.4. Take advantage
    of the points of power where you are strong. Use your power in a positive way
    to do more good for yourself and those around you. If people throughout your
    organization are enabled to develop their sources of power, it could create a
    more even playing field for everyone. Power doesn t have to be concentrated in
    the hands of a few.</span></p>

    motivation is a simple, three-phased approach to motivation. This approach
    states that people can be in one of three levels of commitment to the
    organization the membership level (at the lowest end), the performance level,
    or the involvement level (highest level). A person's level of commitment determines
    how motivated he or she is to accomplish the mission. The more committed a
    person is to the organization, the more involved he or she is in the

    individuals can move to, or remain in, a higher commitment level.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33647"><span id="SPAN-33648">22.4.2. Are methods
    available to measure unit morale or motivation levels? Yes. For instance, the
    Inspector General uses a climate assessment instrument to assess a unit s
    morale. Mark Alexander, author of the article,&nbsp;<i id="I-33649">Organizational Norms,
    The 1977 Annual Handbook for Group Facilitators</i>&nbsp;(1977), defines a set
    of organizational norms and maintains that identifying and evaluating
    organizational norms will result in a morale score. He identified 10 norms
    categories, but we will only examine seven. Paragraph 22.5 is an excerpt from
    the article and norms survey.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33653"><span id="SPAN-33654">Within any
    organizational situation, behavioral forces influence individual effectiveness
    and job satisfaction. To a certain extent, these forces are a result of
    organization requirements that people behave and act in certain ways, that they
    hold certain values and sentiments, and that they interact with others in a
    particular manner.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33655"><span id="SPAN-33656">22.5.1.<b id="B-33657">&nbsp;Required and Emergent Behavior.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33658"><span id="SPAN-33659">An organization s
    required behavior, sentiments, and interactions are not necessarily in effect.
    Existent or emergent behaviors, sentiments, and interactions, in many cases,
    have a much greater influence on organization life than required behavior.
    Emergent behavior correspondingly affects productivity, individual
    satisfaction, and personal development. Behavioral scientists generally
    recognize that emergent organizational behavior is determined largely by
    formation of working group behavioral norms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33660"><span id="SPAN-33661">22.5.1.1.<b id="B-33662">&nbsp;</b>Norms
    are desirable behaviors. They are considered acceptable behavior as prescribed
    by work groups and, in the larger context, by society and its institutions.
    There are numerous examples throughout work and everyday life of emergent
    behavior and the underlying norms that cause this behavior.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33663"><span id="SPAN-33664">22.5.1.2. In the work
    environment, a tendency to establish start and quit times that vary from
    company policy, or a work group's inclination to establish a quicker or slower
    pace than required are two often-cited examples. Outside the work situation,
    normative (or emergent) behavior also occurs, and can be observed in schools,
    institutions, or anywhere that people come together and interact for a period
    of time.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33665"><span id="SPAN-33666">22.5.2.<b id="B-33667">&nbsp;Positive
    or Negative Norms.&nbsp;</b>From the organization's view, norms can be positive
    or negative. Recent studies on organizational norms indicate that they can be
    broken into categories, and that certain types or clusters of positive or
    negative norms can exist in a given work situation. 22.5.2.1. Positive norms
    are those that support the organization's goals and objectives and foster
    behavior directed toward achieving those goals. Norms that support hard work,
    loyalty, quality, and concern for customer satisfaction are examples of
    positive norms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33668"><span id="SPAN-33669">22.5.2.2. Negative norms
    have just the opposite effect. They promote behavior that works to prevent the
    organization from achieving its objectives. Negative norms are those that
    sanction criticism of the company, theft, absenteeism, and low levels of
    productivity.</span></p>

    and Personal Pride.&nbsp;</b>Norms in this category are associated with an
    individual's feelings of identification and sense of pride regarding the
    organization. Positive norms lead the person to see the organization as  his 
    or  hers.  Negative norms are reflected in a  we  and  they  attitude toward
    the organization and its goals. Examples of positive and negative
    organizational and personal pride norms are evident in the competition between
    military organizations. If competition helps the units become better at their
    missions and exhibit greater morale and motivation, then competition is
    positive. On the other hand, if competition hampers the mission and leads to
    reduced morale and motivation, competition is negative.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33688"><span id="SPAN-33689">These norms are
    reflected in the visible behaviors where individuals work together (cooperate).
    Negative norms foster individuality, secrecy, and the belief that success is
    achieved by an attitude of  every man for himself. &nbsp; Positive norms
    promote sharing of information and working together to achieve common goals.
    Thomas Jefferson noted that a candle loses nothing when it lights another
    candle; that is the real nature of partnership and teamwork: give freely of
    yourself and you will be rewarded with abundance. Promoting a positive norm is
    even more critical as all military branches and government agencies work

    enhance or hinder effective supervision. Negative norms cause supervisors to

    Positive norms encourage people to save money and reduce costs; negative norms
    foster a lack of concern for bottom line performance. You may have heard
    someone say  it's good enough for government work.  That is a negative norm
    that has been perpetuated over the years, but is one our Air Force cannot

    result in individual behavior that affects the manner in which a customer is
    served. Positive norms are directed toward maximizing customer satisfaction.
    Negative norms lead to viewing the customer as an obstacle to be avoided. Air
    Force basic doctrine tells us the Air Force's air and space core competencies
    are recognized by our joint  customers.  In other words, the total force, joint
    force, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and others rely on us to do our job
    to the best of our ability. If we do not, we cannot fight and win our Nation s
    wars as we are expected to. Therefore, each organization must cultivate a
    culture that helps our Airmen, Soldiers, Marines, and Sailors develop a
    positive customer relations norm to ensure our Nation can meet any challenge in
    the most effective manner.</span></p>

    determines, to a large degree, whether original and creative behaviors are
    supported and encouraged. Positive norms lead to the stimulation of new ideas
    and to positive change. Negative norms support the status quo and discourage
    experimentation. In today's total and joint forces environment, we must
    encourage everyone to bring innovativeness and creativity to the table in order
    to meet the dynamic threats that terrorism has brought to our shores.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-33713"><span id="SPAN-33714">Positive norms in this
    group encourage training and view development as essential to the ongoing
    operation. Negative norms treat development as a nonessential, nice-to-do, but
    not critical aspect of the operation. We saw firsthand during Hurricane Katrina
    that training is vitally important to the Department of Homeland Security, the
    Federal Emergency Management Agency, the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
    and other natural disaster responders. In addition, Airmen are constantly
    training with soldiers, sailors, and marines to ensure each branch is better
    equipped and prepared to fight the global war on terrorism.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33724"><span id="SPAN-33725">22.7.1. Understanding
    that norms exist, that they can be either positive (supportive of
    organizational goals) or negative (incongruent with organizational goals), and
    that they can be categorized drives the need to measure those norms and develop
    a normative profile.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33726"><span id="SPAN-33727">22.7.2. In effect, a
    normative profile is a statement of organizational strengths and weaknesses on
    a behavioral level.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33728"><span id="SPAN-33729">Understanding their
    impact on an organization's ability to achieve its goals, you should direct
    improvement programs toward changing work group norms rather than individual
    behavior (as is so often the case with organizations' development programs).
    Once norms change, behavioral change should follow. If a military member s
    behavior does not support positive organizational norms, the supervisor needs
    to determine the underlying reasons. The individual's behavior could be a
    result of unmet needs, a result of discipline problems, or both. In order to be
    effective operational managers and expeditionary leaders, supervisors must
    learn to instill positive norms to properly motivate and discipline Airmen.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33734"><b id="B-33735"><span id="SPAN-33736">22.8. Introduction:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-33737"><span id="SPAN-33738">22.8.1. "I'm
    OK-----You're OK" is a euphemism for Transactional Analysis, also called
    TA. To some, TA is a nonverbal reaction to communication between husband and
    wife or parents and children. However, TA is much more than that and can be
    applied to a business, industrial, or military organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33739"><span id="SPAN-33740">22.8.2. TA is a theory
    of personality as well as a systematic psychotherapy for personal growth and
    personal change. As TA evolves, this reaction to communication is finding a
    wide application in organizations and education. TA principles and techniques
    is used by managers to more fully understand themselves and their relationships
    with others, which can lead to them becoming happier, healthier, and more
    productive. TA can be defined by several principles, such as, Ego States,
    Transactions, Life Positions, Strokes, and Time Structuring. These principles
    can be utilized to form techniques to improve individual productivity that, in
    turn, can lead to increased organizational effectiveness.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33741"><b id="B-33742"><span id="SPAN-33743">22.9. Ego States:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-33744"><span id="SPAN-33745">22.9.1. One area of TA
    is the study of individual&nbsp;<i id="I-33746">ego states</i>. We all know, without being
    told, that we are different. The underlying theory of TA is the highlighting of
    those differences. According to Dr. Eric Berne in his book,&nbsp;<i id="I-33747">Games
    People Play,&nbsp;</i>TA analysis states that a human personality is composed
    of ego states commonly referred to as&nbsp;<i id="I-33748">Parent, Adult,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i id="I-33749">Child&nbsp;</i>(PAC).
    Each ego state is relatively separate from the others and each has its own set
    of feelings, beliefs, and behavior patterns. Generally, people act in one ego
    state at a time. In some cases, people may act in two ego states at the same
    time. The states are produced by the playback of recorded data of past events
    involving real people, real times, real places, and real feelings. (Beme:
    23-28)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33750"><span id="SPAN-33751">22.9.2. Another expert
    on this subject, Dr. Thomas Harris, does an excellent job of writing about
    these ego states in his book,&nbsp;<i id="I-33752">I'm</i>&nbsp;<i id="I-33753">OK You re OK.&nbsp;</i>He
    says the Parent ego state is a way of thinking, acting, feeling, and believing
    much the same as our parents and is based upon the brain's recordings of our
    perceptions of our parents' responses. As such, the Parent ego state responds
    immediately and automatically to childlike behavior. The Parent can be a&nbsp;<i id="I-33754">critical&nbsp;</i>Parent
    or an overly&nbsp;<i id="I-33755">nurturing&nbsp;</i>Parent. (Harris: 40-46) Dr. Arnold
    Kambly in his booklet,&nbsp;<i id="I-33756">The ABC's of PAC: An Introduction to
    Transactional Analysis,&nbsp;</i>refers to the Parent as the taught concepts of
    life. "We were taught this behavior from watching authority figures in our
    early childhood." (Harris: I)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33757"><span id="SPAN-33758">22.9.3. Dr. Harris says
    the Child ego contains our basic desires and needs, and the recordings of the
    feelings and reactions of our childhood. Oddly enough, this state develops
    about the same time as the Parent state. The spontaneous dimensions of the
    Child provide for the joy, motivation, and natural creativity of one's own
    personality. "Adopted elements of the Child are expressed in feelings and
    patterns of response to parental stimuli`<b id="B-33759">&nbsp;</b>responses such as
    rebellion, procrastination, or compliance." (Harris: 47-50) Dr. Kambly
    refers to this ego state as "the felt concept of life. These are the
    feelings we have recorded from childhood." (Kambly: I-2) These feelings
    bring forth our emotions and desires for emotion in others.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33760"><span id="SPAN-33761">22.9.4. According to Dr.
    Harris, the third state, the Adult ego state, is a way of acting, feeling, and
    believing that is rather objective. The Adult part of our personality develops
    later than either that of the Parent or the Child, and continues to develop
    throughout the lifetime of a healthy person and is the analytical part of our
    personality that processes current and objective information about our
    environment. The Adult also edits our archaic recordings in the Parent and
    Child parts of personality. (Harris: 50-59) Dr. Kambly says the Adult deals with
    the realities of the world, plus input from the Parent and Child. The Adult
    deals with the "here and now," in contrast to the other two ego
    states which come from the past. (Kambly: 3)  The Adult is the learned concept
    of life. In this case, learned in the Adult is different than the taught of the
    Parent." (Kambly: 3) Learned refers to a continuous process. The Adult is
    always learning. The taught Parent ego state was taught once, in the past.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33762"><span id="SPAN-33763">22.9.5. The three ego
    states appear in our behavior at different times. According to Dr. Harris, a
    healthy individual maintains a balance among the three. However, some people
    may be dominated by one of the ego states. This is&nbsp;<i id="I-33764">contamination.&nbsp;</i>(Harris:&nbsp;
    123-140). According to Dr. Kambly, "contamination takes place when the
    Parent or Child contaminates the Adult." The Adult makes the decisions,
    but these decisions are then distorted due to the past tapes of the Parent or
    Child. Dr. Harris and Dr. Kambly agree that such people have been known to
    create problems for managers who have to work with them. People with
    Childdominated personalities generally do not engage in much rational problem
    solving. They can be hard to reason with in emotionally charged situations
    because these people have learned through earlier experiences that they can
    succeed by being loud, boisterous, or emotional. Parent-dominated people also
    do not engage in much rational problem solving because they already know what
    is right and what is wrong. They are overly critical or overly nurturing. Another
    problem is&nbsp;<i id="I-33765">exclusion.&nbsp;</i>This happens when one ego state excludes
    the others. In this situation, the excluding ego state pushes out the excluded
    ego states. Dr. Kambly points out that "a healthy person has the ego
    states separate and discrete. When things go wrong, contamination or exclusion
    results." (Kambly: 45)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33766"><b id="B-33767"><span id="SPAN-33768">22.10. Life Position:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-33769"><span id="SPAN-33770">22.10.1. Along with ego
    states, the term&nbsp;<i id="I-33771">life</i>&nbsp;<i id="I-33772">position&nbsp;</i>is associated with
    TA. Simply stated, life position is how a person feels about oneself and about
    other people. In the process of growing up, people make some rather basic
    assumptions about themselves and about others in their environment. The
    combination of assumptions about oneself and about others is referred to as a
    life position. Important to state is that the life position has two parts: the
    feelings of self and feelings toward others. This is different than
    self-concept or self-esteem, which only deal with self. Life positions tend to
    be more permanent than ego states. This permanency can create potential
    problems in an organizational setting where people work together even if their
    life positions are not complementary. Life positions result from reinforcement
    received throughout life from expressions of need and responses to expressed
    needs.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33773"><span id="SPAN-33774">22.10.2.
    The focus of the book by Dr. Harris (<i id="I-33775">I'm</i>&nbsp;<i id="I-33776">OK you re OK)&nbsp;</i>is
    on these life positions. "The assumptions are described in terms of
    "okayness." Thus, individuals are labeled either OK or not OK,
    whether they refer to themselves or to someone else. OK and not OK equate to
    value and individual worth. Thus, there are four possible life positions:"
    (Harris:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33777"><span id="SPAN-33778">66)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33779"><span id="SPAN-33780">22.10.2.1. I'm not
    OK You are not OK = neither of us has value (- -).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33781"><span id="SPAN-33782">22.10.2.2.
    I'm not OK You are OK = I don't have value; you have value (- +). 22.10.2.3.
    I'm OK You are not OK = I have value; you don't have value (+ -).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33783"><span id="SPAN-33784">22.10.2.4. I'm OK You
    are OK = We both have value (+ +).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33785"><span id="SPAN-33786">22.10.3. The fourth life
    position is ideal because most people with these feelings tend to have a
    positive outlook on life and are generally successful.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33787"><b id="B-33788"><span id="SPAN-33789">22.11. Transactions and Strokes:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-33790"><span id="SPAN-33791">22.11.1. According to
    Dr. Eric Heme, "a situation which results in social intercourse is dubbed
    a transaction." (Beme: 29)&nbsp; If two or more people encounter each
    other in a social interaction, sooner or later one of them will speak, or give
    some indication of acknowledging the presence of the others. Dr. Heme calls
    this the&nbsp;<i id="I-33792">transactional stimulus</i>. Another person says or does
    something related to this stimulus, and that action is called the transactional
    response. Therefore, simple TA is concerned with diagnosing which ego states
    are used in the transaction (stimulus and response). Transactions may involve
    combinations of ego states and match or replay forms of interactions that
    develop early in life. Simple transactions are those in which both stimulus and
    response arise from the Adult states of the parties concerned. These are&nbsp;<i id="I-33793">parallel&nbsp;</i>or
    c<i id="I-33794">omplementary.&nbsp;</i>Also, Child to Parent transactions (and vice versa)
    is complementary. Complementary means the responses are both appropriate and
    expected. Some transactions are not complementary. The responses are not
    expected or appropriate. For example, an Adult-to-Adult stimulus followed by a
    Child to Parent response is not complementary and is called a&nbsp;<i id="I-33795">crossed&nbsp;</i>transaction.
    These occur when a respondent reacts from an ego state other than the one
    desired by the initiator. Crossed transactions can cause problems, but they
    also have a use as you'll see later. Analyzing the transactions to determine
    the ego states can help determine the life position. As long as transactions
    remain complementary, communication continues regardless of the content of the
    transaction. On the other hand, communication ceases as a result of crossed
    transactions. Dr. Berne's research and experience tell us that crossed
    transactions are barriers to effective communication and negatively impact the
    motivation of people, which ultimately results in decreased output.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33796"><span id="SPAN-33797">22.11.2. Consider the
    following example: The supervisor states, "Staff Sergeant Jones, could you
    come to a meeting in my office around 1300 today?" Staff Sergeant Jones
    replies, "Sure." This is an Adult transaction. Communication could
    continue and the supervisor could say, "Good. I'd like you to brief that
    idea you submitted to the rest of the staff I really think it will work."
    On the other hand, Staff Sergeant Jones could have said, "Oh come on, I've
    already got enough work to do around here. I don't want to sit through another
    boring meeting." In this case, Staff Sergeant Jones is responding
    emotionally and not from the Adult ego state. Therefore, effective
    communication is blocked.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33798"><span id="SPAN-33799">22.11.3. Another type of
    transaction is called a&nbsp;<i id="I-33800">stroke.&nbsp;</i>A stroke is a special form of
    recognition that one person gives to another. Strokes can&nbsp;<i id="I-33801">positive&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<i id="I-33802">negative,&nbsp;</i>and
    are common in any organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33803"><span id="SPAN-33804">22.11.4. According to
    Dr. Kambly, positive strokes can be verbal, nonverbal, or physical. They are
    designed to make the person feel good. They are a type of reward. They can be
    conditional, which means they are based on a certain condition being met.
    Telling a worker, "Hey Staff Sergeant Jones, you did a great job putting
    together the training report." is an example of a positive conditional
    stroke. Positive conditional strokes modify behavior in that they try to get the
    person to continue the behavior. Positive strokes can also be unconditional. An
    unconditional stroke is not based on any condition and is given just for&nbsp;<i id="I-33805">being,&nbsp;</i>not
    for&nbsp;<i id="I-33806">doing.&nbsp;</i>Smiling at someone and telling them you're glad to
    have them as part of the team is a positive unconditional stroke. Positive
    unconditional strokes are designed to make the person feel good about
    themselves. Positive unconditional strokes improve selfesteem, which can help
    lead to a better life position.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33807"><span id="SPAN-33808">22.11.5. Dr. Kambly also
    reviews the negative<i id="I-33809">&nbsp;</i>strokes people use. Negative strokes are
    designed to make the person feel bad. They are a type of punishment or rebuke.
    Just like positive strokes, negative stokes can be conditional or
    unconditional. A negative conditional stroke is used to modify behavior in that
    it is used to get the person to stop the behavior. Issuing a reprimand or
    Article 15 is an example. The act (condition) resulted in the negative
    conditional stroke. A negative unconditional stroke is aimed at the person,
    just like the positive unconditional stroke and is an attack against the person
    and not any specific behavior. Slamming a person, putting them down, or calling
    them names are all examples of negative unconditional strokes. In professional
    relationships, there is never a need to use negative unconditional strokes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33810"><span id="SPAN-33811">22.11.6. Dr. Harris
    identifies different stroking with the different life positions. He has found
    that "people of unhealthy life positions tend to overuse certain types of
    strokes." (Harris: 67- 77) For example, an "I'm OK You're not
    OK" person may overuse negative strokes. The reason is obvious. This
    person thinks they are so much better than everyone else, and they may operate
    from the critical Parent ego state. On the other hand, an "I'm not OK You're
    OK" person may overuse positive strokes. This person sees others as so
    much better than they are. A problem with overusing positive strokes is that
    the strokes become plastic or meaningless. If the supervisor is always using
    them, his or her praise becomes meaningless.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33812"><b id="B-33813"><span id="SPAN-33814">22.12. Time Structuring.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-33815"><span id="SPAN-33816">Another aspect of TA
    deals with&nbsp;<i id="I-33817">time structuring.&nbsp;</i>According to Dr. Kambly, "if
    a person lives to be 75 years old, assuming he or she sleeps 8 hours out of
    every 24, he or she has approximately 50 waking years to spend in some type of
    time structuring." (Kambly: 9) Dr. Heme states there are several options
    for a person. These are: Withdrawal, Rituals, Activities, Pastimes, Games, and
    Intimacy. (Beme: 18-19) A summary of each of these, as taken from Dr. Kambly's
    booklet, is below.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33818"><span id="SPAN-33819">22.12.1.<b id="B-33820">&nbsp;Withdrawal.</b><i id="I-33821">&nbsp;</i>This
    involves no risk and has minimal social rewards because there is minimal
    contact. A person does not have to be alone to be in withdrawal. They can be
    "lost in the crowd." Withdrawal is not always bad. We all need to get
    away and relax or be alone at times. However, if this is the primary way a
    person structures their time, it becomes a problem. This can be dangerous if a
    person uses it all the time. Some people can be withdrawn prior to suicide.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33822"><span id="SPAN-33823">22.12.2.<b id="B-33824">&nbsp;Rituals.</b>&nbsp;Rituals
    are highly structured and predictable ways to structure time. This can be as
    simple as walking down the hall and saying, "Hi Jim. How are you
    today?" Jim then replies, "Hi. I'm fine." This is done out of
    habit and is predictable. You may not really care how Jim is, and Jim may not
    actually be "fine." Rituals are okay at times, but if this is all a
    person does, this is not productive in the work center. Rituals are just small
    talk about things of little value. So, a person who spends most of their time
    in rituals does not contribute as much to the work center. Rituals are slightly
    riskier than withdrawal because there is some interaction. However, the risk is
    minimal because of the structured and predictable nature of rituals.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33825"><span id="SPAN-33826">22.12.3.<b id="B-33827">&nbsp;Activities.&nbsp;</b>These
    are goal oriented. Activities are things people do to meet mission requirements
    or goals. They are production orientated. This is where the majority of time
    should be spent in the work center. People with a healthy life position can
    spend a lot of time in activities and they expect others to be goal-oriented
    (activity-centered) also.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33828"><span id="SPAN-33829">22.12.4.<b id="B-33830">&nbsp;Pastimes.</b>&nbsp;Pastimes
    are ways to structure time, such as hobbies, for relaxation. Things we do
    without a specific goal in mind are all pastimes. Pastimes and activities can
    be confused. You need to look at the intent of the time structuring. For
    example, someone playing golf for fun is structuring their time doing a
    pastime. However, if they are a professional golfer and make money at it, they
    are engaged in activities. The risk is a bit higher for activities and pastimes
    than it is for rituals or withdrawal because there are more chances of
    interaction and more chances for values and differences of opinion to come into
    play. There are more meaningful transactions during activities and pastimes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33831"><span id="SPAN-33832">22.12.5.<b id="B-33833">&nbsp;Games.</b>&nbsp;Games
    are a way to structure time in devious or crooked ways to get strokes (which
    are normally negative). Games are not productive and they result in anger,
    frustration, jealousy, etc. The risks in games are high because of the anger
    and hurt feelings that result. Those with unhealthy life positions normally
    play games. Games, like poor communication, often tend to create organizational
    problems. A basic understanding of the term&nbsp;<i id="I-33834">games&nbsp;</i>is essential
    to the application of TA in management. In his book&nbsp;<i id="I-33835">Games People
    Play,&nbsp;</i>Dr. Berne refers to a game as "a recurring set of
    transactions, often repetitious, superficially plausible, with a concealed
    motivation." (Berne: 48) These types of transactions can be of a type
    called&nbsp;<i id="I-33836">ulterior,&nbsp;</i>meaning there is a hidden or ulterior meaning
    to the transaction. Basically, games are transactions that are designed to
    cause an emotional response such as anger or hurt. A game might be as simple as
    an "I'm not OK You're OK" person speaking from the Child ego state
    trying to get others to be the nurturing Parent. Some games get more complex
    and can even result in death. Given this definition, games become barriers
    preventing people and organizations from achieving their objectives. Games tend
    to inhibit full productivity. Using crossed transactions (responding always
    from your Adult when the game-player is using the Child or Parent) will reduce
    game-playing. For example, assume someone says, "That's the dumbest idea
    I've ever heard of. What moron came up with that?" This person is being a
    critical Parent and not presenting any facts to support the point of view.
    Using your Adult, you could reply, "What parts of the idea do you find
    flawed?" or "Can you provide specific data to support your opinion?"
    These replies use the Adult to seek facts and to focus the person on the&nbsp;<i id="I-33837">here
    and now.</i></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33838"><span id="SPAN-33839">22.12.6.<b id="B-33840">&nbsp;Intimacy.</b>&nbsp;This
    is the most risky, but also the most rewarding type of time structuring and is
    defined as a close relationship with others free of games and exploitation.
    Intimacy is being open, honest, and sincere and requires a person at the
    "I'm OK You're OK" life position. Intimacy is not just sexual
    relationships. A person can have sexual relationships and be in a state of
    withdrawal or ritual. Intimacy is a close personal relationship, and that's why
    the risk and reward are high.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33841"><b id="B-33842"><span id="SPAN-33843">22.13. The Work Environment:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-33844"><span id="SPAN-33845">22.13.1. We can now
    relate the concepts of TA to the environmental process. How do basic concepts
    of TA apply in business, industrial, or military environments? The most basic
    application of TA principles is to managerial styles. TA is a powerful tool
    that can help managers understand the interactive nature of human problems in a
    work environment so<i id="I-33846">&nbsp;</i>that they can deal with these problems more
    effectively. Does the supervisory relationship indicate the need for a
    participative or an authoritarian management style, or does the need indicate
    another point along the continuum? For an authoritarian style, or&nbsp;<i id="I-33847">Theory
    X</i>&nbsp;management, to work effectively, the manager has to operate as a
    Parent while workers operate in the Child state. Supervisors have absolute
    authority while workers are very dependent on direction from above. Thus, the
    boss is OK but workers are not OK. In this situation, the manager accepts final
    responsibility for failure. Being dependent, much like a Child, the worker in
    this situation is protected from making a wrong decision because the boss takes
    full responsibility for all actions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33848"><span id="SPAN-33849">22.13.2. There is
    another view. According to Maslow, Herzberg, and other motivation theorists,
    the authoritarian style of management frustrates achievement of the
    higher-level needs of human personality. Therefore, a worker in this situation
    may find it satisfactory, but may never experience a state of self-fulfillment
    and growth. A common belief among casual observers is that the condition just
    described is common in many organizations. The participative or&nbsp;<i id="I-33850">Theory
    Y&nbsp;</i>management style involves Adult-Adult transactions. A two-way flow
    of communication exists and the worker feels more comfortable in providing his
    or her input. Subordinates feel a sense of responsibility rather than a feeling
    of dependency. Because workers influence decisions and share responsibility,
    they experience a feeling of fulfillment. The corresponding life position is
    likely I'm OK You're OK.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33851"><span id="SPAN-33852">22.13.3. A potential
    exists for crossed transactions in any management setting. In the authoritarian
    approach, the supervisor may be comfortable in the Parent ego state, but the
    worker may not enjoy the Child state. The worker may want to operate in the
    Adult state, and rightfully so. In this situation, Parent-to-Adult
    communication is disturbed and an unsettled situation occurs. The worker
    becomes frustrated, leading to unproductive behavior and performance not a
    healthy situation for any organization. Thus, a manager with an understanding
    of TA, and with knowledge of worker ego states based on observation, could
    possibly head off this type of situation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33853"><span id="SPAN-33854">22.13.4. Crossed
    transactions are also possible while using a participative management style. By
    its very nature, this style encourages employee ego involvement in on-the-job
    activities. Individuals identify closely with work units and jobs because they
    are involved in establishing policies and operating procedures. However, even
    in this style, instances often occur when policies are established and
    decisions are rendered with rule or no employee involvement a simple exercise
    of management prerogative. Such cases provide a fertile ground for crossed
    transactions when disgruntled employees confront individual managers. Here, the
    potential is high for responses from the Parent ego state, and the opportunity
    for conflict exists. Therefore, a skilled manager with an understanding of TA,
    and with knowledge of worker ego states based on observation, can avoid the
    conflict by dealing with those situations from a complementary state.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33855"><span id="SPAN-33856">22.13.5. TA has taken
    hold as a supervisory tool. Initially, it was used mainly to teach employees
    who deal with the public how to relate better to their customers. Later,
    managers experimented with TA as a means of improving communications within the
    company itself. This experimentation has encouraged and reinforced a team
    concept. This is a participative management style whereby management and
    workers share the responsibility for decision-making. Some management
    practitioners view this as cooptation. In other words, it gives workers an
    equitable "share of the pie.  The prevailing philosophy is that workers
    take ownership for their behavior in supporting policies and following
    procedures, which results in allowing more focus on productivity while
    maintaining a high interpersonal working relationship. In TA terms, both
    management and workers function in the Adult ego state. The resulting impact of
    this condition on<b id="B-33857">&nbsp;</b>organizations is that the organization is OK.
    Overall, it can be stated, "Together we are OK. The organization is OK =
    We all have value."&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p id="P-33907"><span id="SPAN-33908">22.14.1. Generally, what
    has been the response to TA? Many executives, after having been exposed to TA
    training, swear by it; others have not responded as well, and consider it just
    another buzz word. TA is very difficult to evaluate objectively. Most
    supervisors are more than willing to prescribe TA training for line employees,
    but do not show much enthusiasm for applying TA concepts to themselves. Even
    though there is skepticism, some supervisors have learned that TA is profitable
    in terms of increasing organizational effectiveness. It's presented here as a
    tool to add to your management tool box.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33909"><span id="SPAN-33910">22.14.2. The application
    of TA tracks well with the management theories of Likert, McGregor, and Argyris
    because use of TA provides opportunities for individuals to grow and mature.
    Even though some workers prefer to function in the Child state and appear to
    avoid responsibility, most desire to be treated as adults and to be given more
    responsibility. Using TA not only provides an opportunity for managers to know
    their people, but it also helps them to get in touch with themselves. When all
    parties involved are aware of each other's needs, communication improves. This
    condition is essential to organizational effectiveness. The effective supervisor
    focuses on workers' behavior and the modification of that behavior as a means
    for improving the organizational climate, thereby ultimately increasing overall
    productivity.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33928"><span id="SPAN-33929">22.16.1. The ability and
    willingness to communicate effectively is the key to supervisory success.
    Although communication effectiveness is based on the ability to make and maintain
    effective contact, regardless of the situation, specific areas of communication
    require some additional thought and planning.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33930"><span id="SPAN-33931">22.16.2. One of the most
    important tools for maintaining control and developing people is the proper use
    feedback. Although feedback has been categorized as positive and negative.
    Another way to view this is to classify it into supportive feedback (which
    reinforces an ongoing behavior) and corrective feedback (which indicates that a
    change in behavior is appropriate). In this sense, all feedback is positive.
    The purpose of all feedback should be to assist an individual in maintaining or
    enhancing his or her present level of effectiveness or appropriateness.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33932"><span id="SPAN-33933">22.16.3. Some feedback,
    by definition, is better than no feedback. There are, however, ways to do it
    well and ways to do it superbly. Here are some guidelines that can help to
    sharpen the process. The most important function of feedback is to help the
    individual who is receiving the feedback to keep in touch with what is going on
    in the environment.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33934"><span id="SPAN-33935">22.16.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-33936">Supportive Feedback:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33937"><span id="SPAN-33938">22.16.4.1. Supportive
    feedback is used to reinforce behavior that is effective and desirable. An
    axiom of effective supervision is "Catch them doing something right and
    let them know it." (Blanchard &amp; Johnson, 1982)</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33939"><span id="SPAN-33940">22.16.4.2. One of the
    most damaging and erroneous assumptions that many supervisors make is that good
    performance and appropriate behavior are to be expected from the employee, and
    that the only time feedback is needed is when the employee does something
    wrong. Therefore, these supervisors never give supportive feedback. If a
    supervisor was determined to give only one kind of feedback, he or she would be
    ahead to choose supportive feedback and let corrective feedback go. In other
    words, if a supervisor stresses errors only, the end result would be, at most,
    an attempt by employees to do standard, error free work. This accomplishment
    would not be bad, but there is a better way.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33941"><span id="SPAN-33942">22.16.4.3. If a
    supervisor concentrated on what the employees were doing well, then superior
    work is what the employees would become aware of. They would begin to view
    their work in terms of performing as well and as creatively as possible. What
    is reinforced has a tendency to become stronger. What is not reinforced has a
    tendency to fade away. If excellence is actively reinforced and errors are
    simply mentioned, employees will focus on excellence and tend to reduce errors.
    The following example of the two types of feedback illustrates the difference.</span></p>

    <p id="P-33953"><span id="SPAN-33954">22.16.4.4. Fortunately,
    however, no one has to make a choice between using only supportive or only
    corrective feedback.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33955"><span id="SPAN-33956">22.16.4.5. Both are
    essential and valuable, and it is important to understand how each works so
    that the maximum gain can be received from the process.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33957"><span id="SPAN-33958">22.16.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-33959">Corrective
    Feedback.&nbsp;</b>Corrective feedback is used to alter a behavior that is
    ineffective or inappropriate and is essential to the growth process as
    supportive feedback. A corrective feedback session, although never hurtful if
    done properly, is not a particularly pleasant experience. Under the best of
    circumstances, the subordinate will probably feel a little defensive or embarrassed.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33960"><span id="SPAN-33961">22.16.5.1. In giving
    corrective feedback, the manager should have an option ready to present. When
    the employee is made aware of the inappropriate behavior, having an immediate
    alternative can be effective and powerful in shaping behavior. By presenting
    the alternative immediately after the corrective feedback, the manager is
    helping the subordinate to come out of a personally uncomfortable situation in
    the shortest possible time. This protects the dignity of the subordinate. The
    manager would also be establishing himself or herself as a supporter of good
    work and good workers, which would go a long way in developing strong,
    productive, supportive working relationships. Also very important, the manager
    would be presenting an alternative that the employee might never have
    considered or that was considered and rejected. This provides for immediate
    learning. Most important, however, is the fact that the manager would make the
    employee aware that an alternative was available at the time the employee chose
    to act<b id="B-33962">&nbsp;</b>otherwise. This awareness can facilitate the employee in
    taking responsibility for his or her own choices. That is, the employee would
    realize, "That's right, I could have done it that way." The following
    example shows how an alternative can be effectively added to the feedback.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33963"><span id="SPAN-33964">22.16.5.2. "When
    you snapped at Ann in front of the group, she appeared to be very embarrassed

    <p id="P-33965"><span id="SPAN-33966">22.16.6.&nbsp;<b id="B-33967">Guidelines
    for Effective Feedback.&nbsp;</b>The following guidelines are helpful for
    managers who are trying to improve their feedback skills, and may also be used
    as a review prior to giving feedback.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33968"><span id="SPAN-33969">22.16.6.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-33970">Deal in Specifics:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33971"><span id="SPAN-33972">22.16.6.1.1. Being
    specific is the most important rule in giving feedback, whether supportive or
    corrective. Unless the feedback is specific, very little learning or
    reinforcement is possible. The following examples illustrate the difference in
    general and specific statements.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33973"><i id="I-33974"><span id="SPAN-33975">General:&nbsp;</span></i><span id="SPAN-33976">"I'm glad to see that your work is
    improving."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33977"><i id="I-33978"><span id="SPAN-33979">Specific:&nbsp;</span></i><span id="SPAN-33980">"I'm pleased that you met every deadline in
    the last three weeks."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33981"><i id="I-33982"><span id="SPAN-33983">General:&nbsp;</span></i><span id="SPAN-33984">"You're a very supportive
    person."&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33985"><i id="I-33986"><span id="SPAN-33987">Specific:&nbsp;</span></i><span id="SPAN-33988">"I appreciate you taking time to explain
    the contract to our new employee."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33989"><i id="I-33990"><span id="SPAN-33991">General:&nbsp;</span></i><span id="SPAN-33992">"You're falling down on the job
    again."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33993"><i id="I-33994"><span id="SPAN-33995">Specific:&nbsp;</span></i><span id="SPAN-33996">"Last month most of the cost reports were
    completely accurate, but last week your profit cost figures were wrong. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33997"><span id="SPAN-33998">22.16.6.1.2. The last
    set is, of course, an example of corrective feedback. General statements in
    corrective feedback frequently result in hostile or defensive confrontations,
    whereas specific statements set the stage for problem-solving interaction.
    Carrying the last illustration one step farther, the manager could add an
    alternative: "Start checking the typed report against the computer
    printouts. Some of the errors may be typos, not miscalculations."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-33999"><span id="SPAN-34000">22.16.6.1.3. If the
    employee is to learn from feedback and respond to it, then he or she must see it
    in terms of&nbsp;<i id="I-34001">observable&nbsp;</i>effects. That is, the employee must be
    able to see clearly how his or her behavior had a direct impact on the group's
    performance, morale, etc. When the employee sees the point of the feedback
    objectively, the issue will be depersonalized, and the employee will be more
    willing to continue with appropriate behaviors or to modify inappropriate
    behaviors. Although the manager's personal approval ( I'm glad to see...")
    or disapproval ("I m disappointed that...") can give emphasis to feedback,
    it must be supported by specific data in order to effect a change in behavior.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34002"><span id="SPAN-34003">22.16.6.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-34004">Focus on Actions, Not
    Attitudes:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34005"><span id="SPAN-34006">22.16.6.2.1. Just as
    feedback must be specific and observable to be effective, it must be
    non-threatening to be acceptable. Although subordinates, like supervisors, are
    always accountable for their behavior<i id="I-34007">,&nbsp;</i>they are never accountable
    for their attitudes or feelings. Attitudes and feelings cannot be measured, nor
    can a manager determine if or when an employee's feelings have changed. For
    feedback to be acceptable, it must respect the dignity of the person receiving
    the feedback.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34008"><span id="SPAN-34009">22.16.6.2.2. No one can
    attack attitudes without dealing in generalities, and frequently attacks on
    attitudes result in defensive reactions. The following example illustrates the
    difference in giving feedback on behavior and giving feedback on attitudes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34010"><span id="SPAN-34011">22.16.6.2.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-34012">Feedback
    on attitude:</b>&nbsp;"You have been acting hostile toward Jim."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34013"><span id="SPAN-34014">22.16.6.2.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-34015">Feedback
    on behavior:</b>&nbsp;"You threw the papers down on Jim's desk and used
    profanity."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34016"><span id="SPAN-34017">22.16.6.2.3. An attitude
    that managers often try to measure is loyalty. Certain actions that seem to
    indicate loyalty or disloyalty can be observed, but loyalty is a result, not an
    action and cannot be demanded; it must be earned. Whereas people have total
    control over their own behavior, they often exercise little control over their
    feelings and attitudes. They feel what they feel. If a manager keeps this in
    mind and focuses more energy on things that can be influenced (i.e. employee
    behavior), changes are more likely to occur.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34018"><span id="SPAN-34019">22.16.6.2.4. The more
    that corrective feedback is cast in specific behavioral terms, the more it
    supports problemsolving and the easier it is to control. The more that
    corrective feedback is cast in attitudinal terms, the more it will be perceived
    as a personal attack and the more difficult it will be to deal with. The more
    that supportive feedback is cast in terms of specific behaviors, the higher the
    probability that those behaviors will be repeated and eventually become part of
    the person's natural way of doing things.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34020"><span id="SPAN-34021">22.16.6.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-34022">Determine the Appropriate
    Time and Place:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34023"><span id="SPAN-34024">22.16.6.3.1. Feedback of
    either type works best if it is given as soon as feasible after the behavior
    occurs. Waiting decreases the impact that the feedback will have on the
    behavior. The passage of time may make the behavior seem less important to the
    manager, other important events begin to drain the energy of the manager, and
    some of the details of the behavior might be forgotten. On the other hand,
    dwelling on it for a long period could blow it out of proportion. From the
    subordinates' viewpoint, the longer the wait for the feedback, the less
    important it must be. The following example illustrates this point.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34025"><span id="SPAN-34026">22.16.6.3.1.1.<b id="B-34027">&nbsp;Tardy
    feedback:</b><i id="I-34028">&nbsp;</i>"You fell below your quota several times last
    month."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34029"><span id="SPAN-34030">22.16.6.3.1.2.<b id="B-34031">&nbsp;Immediate
    feedback:</b><i id="I-34032">&nbsp;</i>"There are only ten products here; your quota
    for today was fourteen."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34033"><span id="SPAN-34034">22.16.6.3.2. Enough time
    should be allotted to deal with the issues in their entirety. A manager can
    undercut feedback effectiveness by looking at the clock and speeding up the
    input so that an appointment can be met. Answering the telephone or allowing
    visitors to interrupt the conversation can have the same effect. The manager
    can also cause unnecessary stress by telling an employee at ten o'clock in the
    morning "I want to see you at three this afternoon." A more
    appropriate procedure would be to say, "Would you please come to my office
    now," or "When you reach a stopping point, drop by my office. I have
    something good to tell you." In addition to an appropriate time, the
    setting is also important. The old proverb, "Praise in public, censure in
    private," is partially correct. Almost without exception, corrective
    feedback is more appropriately given in private. In the case of supportive
    feedback, however, discretion is needed. In many instances, praise in public is
    appropriate and will be appreciated by the subordinate. In other instances,
    privacy is needed to keep the positive effect from being shortcircuited. For
    example, some people make a virtue out of humility; any feedback that
    reinforces their sense of worth is embarrassing. Rather than appreciating an
    audience, this type of employee would find it painful and perhaps resent it.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34035"><span id="SPAN-34036">22.16.6.3.3. Sometimes a
    norm arises in a work group that prevents anyone from making a big deal out of
    good work. This does not mean that the group does not value good work, but
    supportive feedback in private might prevent the employee from feeling he or
    she was responsible for breaking the norm. In other instances, public praise
    can cause jealousy, hostility, or tense working relationships. Therefore, a
    conscious decision should be made about whether or not to give the supportive
    feedback publicly.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34037"><span id="SPAN-34038">22.16.6.3.4. Another important
    consideration is the actual location selected for giving the feedback. The
    delivery of the feedback should match its importance. If the feedback concerns
    an important action, the manager's office would be better than an accidental
    encounter in the hall. On the other hand, the manager might convey a quick
    observation by telling someone at the water fountain, "Say that was
    beautiful artwork on the Madison report." Choosing the time and place is a
    matter of mixing a little common sense with an awareness of what is going on.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34039"><span id="SPAN-34040">22.16.6.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-34041">Refrain from Inappropriately
    Including Other Issues:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34042"><span id="SPAN-34043">22.16.6.4.1. Frequently
    when feedback is given, other issues interfere. When supportive feedback is
    given, any topic that does not relate to the specific feedback point should not
    be discussed if it would undercut the supportive feedback. For example, the
    manager could destroy the good just accomplished by adding, "And by the
    way, as long as you are here, I want to ask you to try to keep your files a
    little neater. While you were away, I couldn't find a thing."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34044"><span id="SPAN-34045">22.16.6.4.2. When
    corrective feedback is given, however, the situation is different. The manager
    will want the feedback to be absorbed as quickly and easily as possible, with
    the employee's negative feelings lasting no longer than necessary. Therefore,
    as soon as the feedback has been understood and acknowledged, the manager is
    free to change the subject. The manager may want to add, "I'm glad that
    you see where the error occurred. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34046"><span id="SPAN-34047">22.16.6.4.3.  Now, as
    long as you are here, I'd like to ask your opinion about ..." This type of
    statement, when used appropriately, lets the subordinate know that he or she is
    still valued. Obviously, the manager should not contrive a situation just to
    add this type of statement, but when the situation is naturally there, the
    manager is free to take advantage of it.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34048"><span id="SPAN-34049">22.16.6.4.4. In certain
    situations, it is appropriate to give supportive and corrective feedback
    simultaneously. Training periods of new employees, performance-appraisal sessions,
    and times when experienced employees are tackling new and challenging tasks are
    all good examples of times when both types of feedback are appropriate.
    Nevertheless, some cautions are necessary.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34050"><span id="SPAN-34051">22.16.6.4.5. Never
    follow the feedback with the word "but." It will negate everything
    that was said before it. If appropriate to give supportive and corrective
    feedback within the same sentence, the clauses should be connected with
    "and." This method allows both parts of the sentence to be heard
    clearly and sets the stage for a positive suggestion. The following examples
    illustrate the difference.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34052"><span id="SPAN-34053">22.16.6.4.5.1. Connected
    with but: "Your first report was accurate, but your others should have
    measured up to it."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34054"><span id="SPAN-34055">22.16.6.4.5.2. Connected
    with and: "Your first report was accurate, and your others should have
    measured up to it."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34056"><span id="SPAN-34057">22.16.6.4.5.3. Connected
    with but: "You were late this morning, but Anderson called to tell you
    what a great job you did on the Miller account."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34058"><span id="SPAN-34059">22.16.6.4.5.4. Connected
    with and: "You were late this morning, and Anderson called to tell you
    what a great job you did on the Miller account."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34060"><span id="SPAN-34061">22.16.6.4.6. Alternate
    the supportive and corrective feedback. Better to mix the supportive feedback
    with the corrective feedback than to give all of one type and then all of the
    other when a great deal of feedback must be given. Regardless of which type
    comes first, the latter will be remembered the most clearly. If a chronic
    self-doubter is first given supportive feedback and then only corrective
    feedback, he or she is likely to believe the supportive feedback was given just
    to soften the blow of the other type. Alternating between the two types will
    make all the feedback seem more genuine.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34062"><span id="SPAN-34063">22.16.6.4.7. Where
    feasible, use the supportive feedback to cushion the corrective feedback. When
    both types of feedback are appropriate, there is usually no reason to start
    with corrective feedback. However, this does not mean that corrective feedback
    should be quickly sandwiched in between supportive feedback statements. Each
    type is important, but frequently supportive feedback can be used as an
    excellent teaching device for areas that need correcting. This is especially
    true if the employee has done a good job previously and then failed later under
    similar circumstances. For example, the manager might say, "The way you
    helped Fred to learn the codes when he was transferred to this department would
    be appropriate in training the new employees."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34064"><span id="SPAN-34065">22.16.7.&nbsp;<b id="B-34066">Principles of Feedback:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34067"><span id="SPAN-34068">22.16.7.1. Two major
    principles govern the use of feedback. The first principle, which relates to
    how feedback is conducted, can be paraphrased, "I can't tell you how you
    are, and you can't tell me what I see." In other words, the person giving
    the feedback is responsible to relate the situation as he or she observes it,
    and the person receiving the feedback is responsible for relating what he or
    she meant, felt, or thought. The second principle is that feedback supports
    growth. Let's define what is meant by "I can't tell you how you are, and
    you can't tell me what I see."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34069"><span id="SPAN-34070">22.16.7.1.1.<b id="B-34071">&nbsp;Receiving
    Feedback</b><i id="I-34072">:&nbsp;</i>"You Can't Tell Me How I Am."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34073"><span id="SPAN-34074">22.16.7.1.1.1. From the
    recipient's viewpoint, the first principle is "You can't tell me how I am,
    and I can't tell you what you see." Although most people realize that giving
    feedback correctly requires skill and awareness, they are less aware of the
    importance of knowing how to receive feedback. When receiving feedback, many
    people tend to argue about, disown, or attempt to justify the information.
    Statements like "I didn't say that," "That's not what I
    meant," and "You don't understand what I was trying to do," are
    attempts to convince the person giving the feedback that he or she didn't see
    or observe what he or she claims. However, the recipient needs to understand
    that the observer, whether manager, peer, or subordinate, is relating what he
    or she experienced as a result of the recipient's behavior. There is nothing
    wrong with the giver and receiver having different viewpoints. The purpose of
    feedback is to give a new<b id="B-34075">&nbsp;</b>view or to increase awareness. If an
    argument ensues and the observer backs down, the recipient is the loser.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34076"><span id="SPAN-34077">22.16.7.1.2.<b id="B-34078">&nbsp;Giving
    Feedback:</b><i id="I-34079">&nbsp;</i>"You Can't Tell Me What I See."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34080"><span id="SPAN-34081">22.16.7.1.2.1. The
    object of giving feedback is not to judge the other person, but to report what
    was seen and heard and what the effects of the behavior were. Personal approval
    or disapproval, even if important, is secondary.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34082"><span id="SPAN-34083">22.16.7.1.2.2. Feedback
    should be given directly to the person for whom it is intended. When others are
    present, the manager sometimes addresses them almost to the exclusive of the
    intended recipient, who sits quietly and gathers information by eavesdropping.
    Good contact with the recipient is an essential element in giving feedback.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34084"><span id="SPAN-34085">22.16.7.1.2.3. Never
    apologize for giving corrective feedback. Corrective or otherwise, feedback is
    a gift; apologies will discount the importance and lessen the impact.
    Nevertheless, corrective feedback must be given in a way that does not
    jeopardize the recipient's dignity and sense of self-worth.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34086"><span id="SPAN-34087">22.16.7.1.2.4. To offer
    an interpretation of the behavior or a hunch about what the behavior might
    indicate is sometimes more helpful. Crucially important is to offer the
    interpretation as a suggestion and never as a judgment or clinical evaluation
    of the person. Only the recipient is capable of putting it into a meaningful
    context. For example, the manager might say, "When Pete showed you the
    error you made; you told him it was none of his concern. I wonder if you were
    mad at Pete for some other reason." This statement shows the recipient the
    behavior and allows him or her to consider a possible cause for that behavior.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34088"><span id="SPAN-34089">22.16.7.1.2.5. The
    appropriate response, as a rule of thumb, is to say  thank you  when either
    type of feedback is received. Also appropriate of course is to ask for clarity
    or more detail on an issue.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34090"><span id="SPAN-34091">22.16.7.1.2.6. The
    purpose of feedback is to help the recipient. Feedback can be thought of as
    food which is very nourishing. When people are hungry, food is what they need.
    But when they are full, food is the last thing they want or need. The same
    applies to ingesting feedback. When people have had enough, they should call a
    halt. Attempting to absorb all the feedback that might be available, or that
    various people would like to give, is like forcing food into a full stomach
    just because someone says,  Please have some more. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34092"><span id="SPAN-34093">22.16.7.1.2.7. The
    recipient is responsible for demanding specificity in feedback. No feedback
    should be accepted as legitimate if it cannot be clearly demonstrated by an
    observable behavior. For example, if someone says, "You're very
    arrogant," an appropriate response would be "What specifically have I
    said or done to cause you to think that?" If that response is countered
    with "I don't know; I just experience you that way," then the
    accusation should be immediately forgotten. People cannot afford to change just
    to meet everyone's personal likes or expectations.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34094"><span id="SPAN-34095">22.16.7.1.2.8. In fact,
    what is impossible is to change to meet everyone's expectations, and the
    situation becomes compounded as more and more people give their feedback. A
    single act can generate disparate feedback from different people who observe
    the behavior. For example, a loud exclamation could be viewed as appropriately
    angry by one person, overly harsh by another, and merely uncouth by a third.
    Each person will see it from his or her unique perspective. Therefore, feedback
    requires action from both the giver and the receiver. Only the giver can tell
    what he or she observed or experienced, and only the recipient can use the
    information in deciding whether or not to change the behavior.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34096"><span id="SPAN-34097">22.16.7.1.2.9. For
    feedback to be effective, the receiver must hear what the giver is saying,
    weigh it, and then determine whether or not the information is relevant. The
    following example illustrates how this can be done.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34098"><b id="B-34099"><span id="SPAN-34100">Department
    manager:&nbsp;</span></b><span id="SPAN-34101">"Waste in your unit
    is up by four percent. Are you having any problems with your employees?"</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34102"><b id="B-34103"><span id="SPAN-34104">Supervisor:&nbsp;</span></b><span id="SPAN-34105">"I was not aware of the waste increase. No,
    I am not having trouble with my employees. I suppose I have been focusing on
    the quality so much that I lost sight of the waste figures. Thanks for bringing
    this to my attention."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34106"><span id="SPAN-34107">22.16.7.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-34108">Feedback
    Supports Growth.&nbsp;</b>The second major principle, "feedback supports
    growth," is important because we cannot always see ourselves as others see
    us. Although an individual may be the world's foremost authority on himself or
    herself, there are still parts of the individual that are more obvious to other
    people. Although people may be more aware of their own needs and capabilities
    and more concerned about their own welfare than other people are, they are able
    to stretch themselves and grow if they pay attention to feedback from others.
    Although feedback may be extremely uncomfortable at the time, the individual
    can look back later and realize the feedback was the spark that inspired the
    change that turned his or her career or personal life in a different direction.
    If the feedback is not rejected or avoided, recipients can discover and develop
    ways to work that they did not think were available.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34109"><span id="SPAN-34110">22.16.8.&nbsp;<b id="B-34111">Feedback Strategies:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34112"><span id="SPAN-34113">22.16.8.1. The
    strategies suggested here are not step-by-step procedures to be blindly
    followed. Their purpose is to help in planning and organizing an approach to
    deal with an issue. They offer a logical and effective sequence of events for
    the feedback session. The person planning the session must decide on the
    desired future objective. (The future<i id="I-34114">,&nbsp;</i>however, could be five
    minutes after the session or two years later.) During the feedback session,
    attention must be focused on what is happening in terms of the outcome. That
    is, the focus must be on obtaining the goal, not on sticking to the strategy.
    This focus allows the giver to change tactics or even modify the original strategy
    if conditions change or unforeseen events occur. After the strategy is
    selected, the following three rules should be kept in mind:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34115"><span id="SPAN-34116">22.16.8.1.1. Be clear
    about what you want in terms of specific, identifiable outcomes for yourself,
    your subordinate, and the organization.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34117"><span id="SPAN-34118">22.16.8.1 2. Plan what
    you intend to say and how you intend to conduct the meeting, according to the
    particular strategy you will use.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34119"><span id="SPAN-34120">22.16.8.1.3. Have the
    strategy in mind as you engage the individual, but keep it in the background.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34121"><span id="SPAN-34122">22.16.8.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-34123">Supportive
    Feedback Strategy.</b>&nbsp;The following steps are suggested as a strategy for
    supportive feedback:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34124"><span id="SPAN-34125">22.16.8.2.1.&nbsp;<b id="B-34126">Acknowledge
    the specific action to be reinforced.&nbsp;</b>Immediately let the subordinate
    know that you are pleased about something he or she did. Be specific and
    describe the event in behavioral terms. "You finished the project</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34127"><span id="SPAN-34128">(action) on time
    (result)."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34129"><span id="SPAN-34130">22.16.8.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-34131">Explain
    the effects of the accomplishment and state your appreciation.</b><i id="I-34132">&nbsp;</i>For
    the behavior to be reinforced, the person must be able to see the effects of
    that behavior in specific, observable ways. Your appreciation is important, but
    as an additional reinforcing element. The main reinforcement is the effect.
    "It was a major factor in securing the contract (effect), and I am pleased
    with your outstanding work (appreciation)."</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34133"><span id="SPAN-34134">22.16.8.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-34135">Help
    the subordinate to take full responsibility for the success.</b><i id="I-34136">&nbsp;</i>If
    the employee acknowledges the feedback, this step is accomplished. If the
    employee seems overly modest, more work is needed. Unless he or she can, to
    some degree, internalize the success and receive satisfaction from it, very
    little growth will occur. One approach would be to ask how the success was
    accomplished or if any problems were encountered and how they were overcome. In
    talking about what happened, the employee is likely to realize how much he or
    she was really responsible for. What is important is for both you and the
    employee to hear how the success was accomplished.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34137"><span id="SPAN-34138">22.16.8.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-34139">Ask
    if the subordinate wants to talk about anything else.</b>&nbsp;While the
    employee is feeling positive and knows that you are appreciative and receptive,
    he or she may be willing to open up about other issues. The positive energy
    created by this meeting can be directed toward other work related issues, so
    take advantage of the opportunity.</span></p>

    the subordinate for the good performance</b>. The final step, again thanking
    the subordinate for the accomplishment, assures that your appreciation will be
    uppermost in his or her mind as he or she leaves and returns to the work
    setting.</span></p>

    describe the event in behavioral terms and explain the effect</b>. Clearly
    relate in specific, observable, and behavioral terms the nature of the failure
    or behavior and the effect of the failure or behavior on the work group or
    organization. If you can appropriately say something to reduce the employee's
    embarrassment, the employee is more likely to accept the feedback
    non-defensively.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34149"><span id="SPAN-34150">22.16.9.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-34151">Ask
    what happened.</b><i id="I-34152">&nbsp;</i>Before assuming that the subordinate is at
    fault, ask what happened. In many instances, the subordinate is not at fault or
    is only partially responsible. At worst, the employee is given an opportunity
    to explain before you proceed; at best, you may receive information that would
    prevent you from censuring the employee.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34153"><span id="SPAN-34154">22.16.9.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-34155">Help
    the subordinate to take full responsibility for the actions.</b><i id="I-34156">&nbsp;</i>The
    more time spent in step 2 (finding out what happened), the easier step 3 will
    be. The subordinate needs to learn from the experience in order to reduce the
    probability of a reoccurrence. Unless this step is handled effectively, the
    subordinate will see himself or herself as a victim, rather than as someone who
    made a mistake and is willing to correct it.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34157"><span id="SPAN-34158">22.16.9.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-34159">Develop
    a plan to deal with the issues.</b><i id="I-34160">&nbsp;</i>Once the subordinate has
    accepted responsibility, the next step is to help rectify the situation. Now
    that the employee is willing to be accountable for errors, you can
    collaboratively devise a plan that will help eliminate them. That is, both of
    you must agree to take action. If you each want the same thing, such as better
    performance from the subordinate, then both of you are obligated to do
    something about it. This is also an excellent opportunity to build on the
    subordinate's strengths (e.g., "I d like for you to show the same fine
    attention to safety regulations that you show to job specifications.")</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34161"><span id="SPAN-34162">22.16.9.5.<b id="B-34163"><i id="I-34164">&nbsp;</i>State

    resolved, end the session by stating your confidence in the ability of the
    employee to handle the situation. The object is to allow the subordinate to
    reenter the work setting feeling as optimistic about his or her self as the
    situation permits. The subordinate must also understand that you will follow up
    and give additional feedback when the situation warrants.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34169"><span id="SPAN-34170">Remember, the concept of power in the workforce usually has a
    negative connotation. It brings to mind such associations as coercion,
    manipulation, and even corruption. This does not have to be the case. Power has
    many positive aspects, and everyone can learn to explore and harness different
    sources of the individual power they have in the workplace. Develop your own
    sources of power, and employees will be less dependent on others for the
    leadership they need. Thus, if you want to do more good for yourself and more
    good for the people around you, it is important to learn how to tap into your
    own points of power.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34184"><span id="SPAN-34185">23.1.1. Effective
    Airmanship requires good decision-making. From Airman Basic to General the
    decisions each of us make every day impact the delivery of airpower. The
    following chapter is designed to spur development of critical thinking habits
    in our Airmen and deepen their awareness of the decision-making processes. The
    habits of mind necessary to become a critical thinker are developed over time;
    there is no magical process or checklist to follow. Each of us must work every
    day to make good decisions by consciously applying the intellectual analysis
    necessary to account for complexities not normally considered and often
    overlooked.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34186"><i id="I-34187"><span id="SPAN-34188">The process of decision-making is as important as the information

    <p id="P-34189"><span id="SPAN-34190">23.1.2. Decisions are
    made by individuals acting alone, in groups, or on behalf of organizations,
    each of these levels of decision-making present a variety of challenges. The
    following discussion is intended to highlight these challenges and make you
    aware of the conscious and unconscious challenges to applying good habits of
    mind (critical thought) as Airmen every day.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34195"><b id="B-34196"><span id="SPAN-34197">23.2. Cognitive Bias:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-34198"><span id="SPAN-34199">23.2.1. In thinking
    about problems we are seldom the perfectly rational actor we hope to be.
    Instead we are influenced by a number of factors that shape how we interpret
    information, weigh its relevance, and ultimately decide upon a course of action
    or inaction as the situation dictates. Psychologists use the term&nbsp;<i id="I-34200">bounded
    rationality</i>&nbsp;to describe the actual operating state of the human mind.
    What this means is that we are unable to be comprehensive in our gathering and
    analysis of information as decision-making models assume. Instead of being
    truly rational, and making the best possible decision, we end up  <i id="I-34201">satisficing.</i> </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34202"><span id="SPAN-34203">23.2.2. Cognitive bias
    in our decision processes result in several  traps' decision-makers need to
    guard against. Some of the more common are:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34204"><span id="SPAN-34205">23.2.2.1.<b id="B-34206">&nbsp;Overconfidence
    bias.</b>&nbsp;Humans are overconfident in their own judgments, often
    unreasonably so.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34207"><span id="SPAN-34208">23.2.2.2.<b id="B-34209">&nbsp;Sunk-cost
    effect.&nbsp;</b>The tendency to escalate commitment to a course of action you
    have already made a substantial investment or resources in (time, money,
    personnel, etc.) despite poor performance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34210"><span id="SPAN-34211">23.2.2.3.<b id="B-34212">&nbsp;Availability
    bias.&nbsp;</b>Tendency to place too much emphasis on information we have
    available instead of the information we need during decision-making.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34213"><span id="SPAN-34214">23.2.2.4.<b id="B-34215">&nbsp;Confirmation
    bias.&nbsp;</b>The most prevalent bias, this propensity refers to our tendency
    to gather and use information that confirms our existing views while
    downplaying or avoiding information that challenges our working hypothesis.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34216"><span id="SPAN-34217">23.2.2.5.<b id="B-34218">&nbsp;Anchoring
    bias.</b>&nbsp;The unconscious tendency to allow an initial reference point to
    distort our estimates, even when that initial reference point is completely
    arbitrary. Starting at an extreme position may act as an anchor for all parties
    in a decision process or negotiation. In a negotiation, this bias can work in
    favor of the side that stakes out the initial reference point both sides tend
    to use the initial position as a reference point for the solution (i.e. car
    salesman techniques).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34219"><span id="SPAN-34220">23.2.2.6.<b id="B-34221">&nbsp;Illusory
    bias.</b>&nbsp;Tendency to jump to conclusions about the relationship between
    two variables when in fact no relationship (correlation) exists.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34222"><span id="SPAN-34223">23.2.2.7.<b id="B-34224">&nbsp;Hindsight
    bias.</b>&nbsp;The tendency to judge past events as easily predictable when in
    fact they were not easily foreseen. This bias limits our ability to learn from
    past mistakes and may affect how leaders evaluate subordinate decision-making.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34225"><span id="SPAN-34226">23.2.2.8.<b id="B-34227">&nbsp;Egocentrism.</b>&nbsp;When
    we attribute more credit to ourselves for group or collaborative outcome than
    an outside party making an unbiased assessment would.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-34228"><span id="SPAN-34229">23.2.3.<b id="B-34230">&nbsp;</b>As
    decision makers Airmen need to be aware of cognitive biases and consciously
    take steps to guard against their affects. The habitual application of critical
    thinking methods to the gathering and analysis of information helps reduce our
    unconscious and natural tendency to satisfice in decision-making. Some
    techniques to counter cognitive biases include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34231"><span id="SPAN-34232">23.2.3.1.<b id="B-34233">&nbsp;After-action
    reviews</b>&nbsp;provide powerful learning moments for participants and serve
    as a forum for feedback to the decision maker about his/her decision style  
    helping to prevent repetition of mistakes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34234"><span id="SPAN-34235">23.2.3.2.<b id="B-34236">&nbsp;Seeking
    unbiased outside expert input</b>&nbsp;can help provide a check and balance on
    reasoning and the interpretation of available information.&nbsp;</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34237"><span id="SPAN-34238">23.2.3.3.<b id="B-34239">&nbsp;Creating
    a decision environment encouraging candid dialogue</b>&nbsp;and vigorous debate
    is perhaps the most effective way to minimize the influence of cognitive bias.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34240"><b id="B-34241"><span id="SPAN-34242">23.3. Mental Frames:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-34243"><span id="SPAN-34244">23.3.1. Each of us uses
    mental frameworks and shortcuts to simplify our understanding of a complex
    world. The use of these frameworks helps us process information quickly and
    efficiently. Understanding that these frameworks contribute to the bias
    presented earlier, the following discussion is intended to make you aware of
    how the frameworks you have built, based on your own unique personal
    experiences; these experiences shape your own decision-making process and the
    solutions you derive.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34245"><span id="SPAN-34246">23.3.2. Frames consist
    of our assumptions about how things are related and how they work. How we frame
    a problem influences the decisions we make. This effect is particularly
    noticeable when framing a challenge as either a risk or an opportunity.
    Research shows that the human mind estimates the expected return when
    confronted with a risky situation and that we tend to be risk adverse. Our risk
    aversion and the importance of framing are explained in Prospect Theory.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34247"><b id="B-34248"><span id="SPAN-34249">23.4. Prospect Theory.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-34250"><span id="SPAN-34251">According to the&nbsp;<i id="I-34252">Prospect
    Theory,</i>&nbsp;framing a situation as a potential gain causes decision makers
    to act differently than framing same situation as a potential loss. Faced with
    potential losses most people are willing to take greater risks than when facing
    with potential gains. The Prospect Theory helps explain our tendency to
    escalate commitment based on sunk costs instead of making rational evaluations
    based on how things exist today. Based on sunk cost arguments, leaders often
    take-on more and more risk, committing additional resources in order to avoid
    losses even when the chances of success are low.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34253"><b id="B-34254"><span id="SPAN-34255">23.5. Risk or Opportunity.</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-34256"><span id="SPAN-34257">Another implication of
    framing is how organizations react when faced with changes in the operating
    environment or mission tasking. At the organizational level, threats to our
    comfortable framework of assumptions are often met with rigid resistance while
    changes we see as opportunities are met with flexible and adaptable approaches.
    Often inaccurate expectations are established as a result of mental frames
    applied by decision makers. As human beings Airmen are subject to the initial
    frameworks we establish when confronting change. For good or bad these
    frameworks act to limit the information we take in, our willingness to fairly
    and unbiasedly assess information, and ultimately restrict the solution sets we
    create.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34258"><b id="B-34259"><span id="SPAN-34260">23.6. Intuition:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-34261"><span id="SPAN-34262">23.6.1. When decision
    makers use intuition to choose courses of action they are not evaluating a
    whole series of alternatives and are not selecting solutions based on objective
    analysis. Intuition is based on previous experience, and matching patterns from
    these experiences, to cues picked up in the current environment. As patterns
    are recognized, humans automatically reason by analogy, projecting past
    situations into our current environment. Based on recognition of patterns,
    decision makers often select a course of action as if reading a script, instead
    of exploring a wide range of options. Having decided on an initial preferred
    course of action, senior leaders often mentally play out the solution; and if
    it seems feasible, they go with it. For decision makers, intuition is both a
    powerful guide and a potential decision trap.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34263"><span id="SPAN-34264">23.6.2. When operating
    in challenging or ambiguous situations, highly experienced professionals often
    have intuitive reactions to events. Although unable to articulate their
    unconscious pattern recognition, experts are often correct in their analysis
    and selection of a course of action despite what a novice may perceive as a
    lack of information or signals pointing to a contrary course of action. In highly
    complex and ambiguous situations, however, the complexity obscures pattern
    recognition and experienced Airmen can mistakenly apply incorrect or outdated
    models, resulting in poor decision-making. This is especially true when
    decision makers are operating outside of their experience base, for instance,
    when leading higher-level organizations or moving from one career field to
    another.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-34265"><b id="B-34266"><span id="SPAN-34267">23.7. Key Points to Remember:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-34268"><span id="SPAN-34269">23.7.1. Airmen,
    especially leaders within any organization, must be careful about imposing
    mental frames on themselves and their team in order to create an environment
    where critical thinking is exercised. When leaders hold back personal opinions
    they avoid framing the situation in preconceived ways (that constricts the
    range of advice and alternatives offered). By consciously avoiding the natural
    tendency to view change as threatening, intentionally framing change as an
    opportunity, Airmen are free to exercise the habits of mind necessary to make
    well informed decisions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34270"><span id="SPAN-34271">23.7.2. A challenge for
    Airmen in a position of responsibility is to avoid the human tendency to
    continue a course of action due to sunk costs; proper use of combined intuitive
    judgment and formal analysis is one means for avoiding this decision trap. The
    use of analysis to check intuition is an effective decision-making technique.
    Formal analysis can check intuition and assures you challenge your intuitive
    judgment, not confirm it. Conversely, intuition is useful in validating and
    testing the assumptions that underlie analysis. As Airmen, recognizing the
    value of intuition is just as critical as guarding against a lack of analysis
    in the decision-making process. Do not try to replace intuition with rules and
    procedures; intuition is often compressed experience indicating as of yet
    unrecognized patterns in the environment. Airmen must routinely and consciously
    create decision processes with information flowing freely in both directions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34272"><span id="SPAN-34273">23.7.3. A simple
    five-step process for communicating intuitive decisions, seeking feedback, and conveying
    intent is to use the following statements when addressing decision teams:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34274"><span id="SPAN-34275">23.7.3.1. Here's what I
    think we face.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34276"><span id="SPAN-34277">23.7.3.2. Here's what I
    think we should do.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34278"><span id="SPAN-34279">23.7.3.3. Here's why.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34280"><span id="SPAN-34281">23.7.3.4. Here's what we
    should keep our eye on.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34282"><span id="SPAN-34283">23.7.3.5. Now, talk to
    me.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34284"><b id="B-34285"><span id="SPAN-34286">23.8. Analogies:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-34287"><span id="SPAN-34288">23.8.1. Analogies are very powerful
    decision-making tools and often the greatest innovative breakthroughs occur
    when analogies from one field or domain are applied to others. Reasoning by
    analogy occurs when we assess a situation and match it to similar experiences
    we have encountered, assuming that they are alike. At the conscious level,
    Airmen can deliberately use analogies to frame a decision-making process; they
    save time and provide clues about possible courses of action and implications,
    at the unconscious level analogies play a large role in intuition as discussed
    in the previous section.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34289"><span id="SPAN-34290">23.8.2. The critical
    thinking trap inherent in the use of analogies is that they can lead us to
    focus on similarities between events and downplay important differences. Very
    powerful experiences from our past leave us overly reliant on very salient
    analogies, even when they no longer fit current situation; thus, blinding
    Airmen to the requirement to explore and question underlying assumptions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34291"><span id="SPAN-34292">23.8.3. In order to
    avoid the temptation to focus on similarities and downplay differences decision
    makers and their teams should consciously make two lists: one describing
    similarities and the other describing differences. A second technique is to
    write down and clearly define what you know, what is unknown, and what you
    presume about the situation you are analyzing. The objective of both these
    techniques is to clearly separate fact from assumption and then probe your
    presumptions carefully. The act of questioning our assumptions in any decision
    process is, at its heart, how we apply the habits of mind necessary for good
    critical thought.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34300"><span id="SPAN-34301">23.9.1. Conventional
    wisdom holds that groups make better decisions than individuals because they
    draw from a diverse base of talent and experience. Unfortunately, many groups
    fail to make good decisions because they fail to merge the diverse ideas and
    recognize potential synergies; the result is a failure to capitalize on the
    team's diverse talents. When this happens teams can actually make worse
    decisions than a talented individual. Airmen must be conscious of how group
    decisions are made and create teams capable of applying critical thought to
    problems in a group setting.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34302"><span id="SPAN-34303">23.9.2. Airmen engaged
    in the group decision-making must consciously structure the process to
    encourage critical thinking. Leaders must begin by deciding:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34304"><span id="SPAN-34305">23.9.2.1. Who should be
    involved in the decision process?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34306"><span id="SPAN-34307">23.9.2.2. In what sort
    of environment does the decision take place?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34308"><span id="SPAN-34309">23.9.2.3. How will the
    participants communicate?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34310"><span id="SPAN-34311">29.9.2.4. How will the
    leader control the decision process?</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34312"><span id="SPAN-34313">23.9.3. Unfortunately,
    due to bias, a lack of time, framing, personnel shortages, outside pressure, or
    any number of other reasons leaders often fail to decide  how to decide? 
    Instead, they rely on existing decision processes and groups, even though they
    may be unreliable given the context of the issue.</span></p>
    
    <p align="center" id="P-34314"><span id="SPAN-34315">23.9.4. Some argue that
    groups are more intelligent than individual experts because the aggregation of
    their judgment leads to a better answer, even though they are not a group of
    experts. In some cases this is true, but it is not a given.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34316"><span id="SPAN-34317">Several critical
    preconditions are necessary. To be effective groups of non-experts must:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34318"><span id="SPAN-34319">23.9.4.1. Be diverse.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34320"><span id="SPAN-34321">23.9.4.2. Represent many
    different disciplines, perspectives, and areas of expertise.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34322"><span id="SPAN-34323">23.9.4.3. Be
    decentralized.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34324"><span id="SPAN-34325">23.9.4.4. Be able to
    effectively aggregate all the individual judgments.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34326"><span id="SPAN-34327">23.9.4.5. Contain
    members who are independent (most important).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34328"><span id="SPAN-34329">23.9.5. Within groups,
    information-processing problems can prevent the pooling of collective
    knowledge. Group members tend to discuss areas of common information while
    failing to surface privately held information for personal reasons or a failure
    to recognize its importance. Airmen, because of our shared heritage and
    commitment to teamwork must constantly guard against the trap of ignoring
    information in an effort to find common ground. Even when data is widely
    discussed and analyzed, the filtering of data as it moves up the decision chain
    can prevent decision makers from having access to the nuances of these
    discussions during the decision process. If as an Airmen you are in positions
    to make decisions based on the recommendations of groups you should be aware of
    how the group was set-up and operated and make an effort to understand the
    decision-making process they used.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34335"><span id="SPAN-34336">23.9.6.1. Individuals
    must be able to sway others in the crowd, a condition that is often lacking in

    <p id="P-34341"><span id="SPAN-34342">23.9.6.4. The tendency
    of some individuals to dominate the discussions can inhibit less aggressive
    members from presenting their ideas, especially if these ideas are call into

    <p id="P-34343"><span id="SPAN-34344">23.9.6.5. Conversely,

    a well-known decision trap most of us are familiar with and a major reason
    groups make flawed decisions.&nbsp;<i id="I-34352">Groupthink</i>&nbsp;occurs when
    tremendous pressures within the team for conformity and a desire for unanimity
    drive decision-making at the expense of true critical thinking. Without candid
    dialogue between team members, and real assessment of options, groups tend to
    spend most of their time tweaking proposed solutions rather than examining
    evidence and assumptions to create new options. Many factors contribute to
    groupthink, including the homogeneity of the group, reporting and supervisory
    chains, and permanent versus long-term nature of the groups involved.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34353"><span id="SPAN-34354">23.10.2. Within groups,
    especially long standing groups, individuals often self-sensor based on a
    desire to avoid becoming ostracized and marginalized. As a result, a fallacy
    develops within the team; each member erroneously believes the other team
    members unanimously support a decision or course of action, making it harder to
    present dissenting opinions. If alternative options were previously examined
    and dismissed, they are rarely reconsidered based on new information or changes
    in the decision environment.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34388"><span id="SPAN-34389">23.12.1. Disagreement
    between participants in any decision process is necessary to stimulate inquiry
    and analysis. The challenge for leaders in any decision process is to create
    constructive conflict while retaining the teamwork and relationships necessary
    for future decision events. In the decision-making process, debate focused on
    the issues and ideas at hand (<i id="I-34390">cognitive conflict</i>) is constructive; on
    the other hand, emotional and personal outbursts (<i id="I-34391">affective conflict</i>)
    are not.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34392"><span id="SPAN-34393">23.12.2. A key aspect of
    managing the decision process is to stimulate&nbsp;<i id="I-34394">cognitive conflict</i>&nbsp;to
    advocate positions and analysis debating concepts, but not attacking the person
    representing them. Airmen in leadership positions should clearly establish
    ground rules for interaction during deliberations and require participants to

    <p id="P-34398"><span id="SPAN-34399">23.13.1. Decision makers
    must ensure they are not structuring their decision process to minimize
    conflict at the expense of critical thinking. Leaders set the example by:
    identifying and articulating the mental models they apply, encouraging others
    to challenge these models, avoiding prematurely selecting courses of action
    before debate is finished, and encouraging others to make mistakes. In other
    words, professional debate is constructive, unprofessional personalization of
    debate is not. Without adhering to the levels of professionalism expected of
    Airmen we squelch the critical thinking necessary to innovate and ensure good
    decision-making.</span></p>

    include assigning members to act as adversaries; and/or to advocate multiple
    scenarios address the problem. These techniques give participants the
    responsibility to provide contrary perspectives and use varying lenses for
    information analysis. Dissenters must be encouraged to try to persuade other
    team members, not senior leadership; this practice stimulates debate and forces
    critical thinking. However, if employed, senior leaders must guard against the
    temptation to domesticate dissenters, using them as token  devils advocates. </span></p>

    <p id="P-34409"><span id="SPAN-34410">Many leaders and
    organizations are plagued by chronic and persistent indecision. Indecision
    resulting from dysfunctional patterns of behavior manifests itself as one of
    three harmful organizational cultures: (1) culture of  no ; (2) culture of
     yes ; and 3) culture of  maybe. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34411"><span id="SPAN-34412">23.14.1.<b id="B-34413">&nbsp;Culture
    of no</b>. Organizations with a culture of no have established a decision
    process where lone dissenters are able to issue non-concurs within the planning
    process, effectively blocking overall organizational goals because they
    conflict with internal sub-organizational interests. This culture can arise in
    organizations where decision meetings focus on dissections of proposals instead
    of true debate and analysis. Leaders who reward subordinates based on their
    ability to dissect others ideas without providing alternative courses of action
    enable and promote a culture of no. Do not forget the importance of being able
    to differentiate between the use of a  devil's advocate  and the culture of no.
    In a culture of no, dissenters are trying to tear down or block proposals and
    ideas, not critique a proposal with the intent of strengthening it.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34414"><span id="SPAN-34415">23.14.2.<b id="B-34416">&nbsp;Culture
    of yes.</b>&nbsp;Within a culture of yes, dissenters tend to stay silent. This
    silence becomes a tacit endorsement of the proposal without the benefit of
    analysis and debate. In this form of organizational culture, once a decision is
    made subordinates later express disagreement to distance themselves from a
    decision or work to overturn or undermine the implementation of the plan.
    Airmen operating in this type of culture must understand that silence does not
    mean assent and watch for those not contributing to the discussion. This type
    of culture can develop when leadership devalues critical analysis. Overcoming
    this cultural tendency requires leadership to create constructive conflict
    within the decision process to surface and analyze concerns and alternative
    interpretations of evidence.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34417"><span id="SPAN-34418">23.14.3.<b id="B-34419">&nbsp;Culture
    of maybe.</b>&nbsp;Under the culture of maybe, decision makers work to gather
    as much information as possible, so much so they become trapped in  <i id="I-34420">analysis
    paralysis</i>.  Under&nbsp;<i id="I-34421">analysis paralysis</i>, decision makers constantly
    delay action because they think more information and analysis will clarify
    their choice. This culture tends to develop in organizations facing highly
    ambiguous situations; or in organizations where competing sections/leaders
    practice conflict avoidances as opposed to open analysis and debate. In these
    organizations, decision makers must balance the benefit of gaining more
    information against the diminishing returns they provide (as opposed to
    initiating action). While leaders are seldom able to accurately calculate the
    cost versus benefit of waiting for additional clarity, intuitive judgment
    serves as a cut-off for unnecessary delay.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34425"><span id="SPAN-34426">23.14.4.1. The process
    by which a decision is made significantly influences implementation and
    follow-through of the solution. The key aspect to outcome of a critical
    decision is consensus among the team responsible for enactment. Consensus does
    not mean unanimity rather, consensus is a commitment to, and shared
    understanding of, the desired outcome.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34427"><span id="SPAN-34428">23.14.4.2. Sections
    above discussed the need for debate and conflict in applying true critical
    thinking to decisions and the challenge of keeping the debate constructive.
    Airmen must also work to make sure the process is fair and legitimate. Even
    when participants agree with the chosen course of action, if they do not see
    the process as legitimate they are often disenchanted with the outcome.
    Procedural fairness provides support to decision makers, especially when they
    are making unpopular decisions.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34429"><span id="SPAN-34430">23.14.4.3. Fair
    processes helps build consensus. More importantly, they aid implementation
    because participants feel that all perspectives have been considered and
    analyzed. If decision-makers are subjective in their analysis, participants
    lose faith in the decision process, making it difficult to support the outcome.
    Providing participants with time and venues to air positions, and a transparent
    system of weighing different perspectives, is important. In essence, fair
    process means that the decision maker demonstrates genuine consideration of
    alternatives. This does not mean debate continues endlessly. When final
    decisions are made the fairness of the process is what allows Airmen arguing
    for various positions to rally around the designated way ahead with confidence
    that the decision maker considered all aspects before making the decision on
    which course of action to pursue.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34431"><span id="SPAN-34432">23.14.4.4. Procedural
    legitimacy in decision-making occurs when the decision process is perceived to

    Airmen in leadership positions must avoid artificially limiting debate and
    analysis of information. In order to create an organizational culture of
    decision legitimacy leaders can do the following:</span></p>

    Normalizing Deviance.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34448"><span id="SPAN-34449">Within the United States
    Air Force, like any other organization decisions made in highly complex tightly
    integrated environments often have unanticipated consequence. If Airmen are
    unaware of, or have failed to think through decisions catastrophic failure can
    be the result. With the understanding of the role all Airmen play in using the
    habits of mind for critical thinking provided above, the following sections
    examine two perspectives on decision-making failure one structural; the other
    behavioral (Normal Accident Theory, Normalized Deviance).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34450"><span id="SPAN-34451">23.14.6.<b id="B-34452">&nbsp;Normal Accident Theory:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34453"><span id="SPAN-34454">23.14.6.1. This theory
    rests upon the assumption that in any highly complex high-risk organizational
    structure decision failures are unavoidable. High-risk systems are systems
    classified by their complexity and the coupling of multiple processes occurring
    in conjunction with one another. Systems that are interactively complex and
    tightly coupled are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic failure stemming
    from mistakes made by decision makers, often small mistakes, which go unrecognized
    or uncorrected and increasingly skew outcomes as they work their way through
    the system.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34455"><span id="SPAN-34456">23.14.6.2. In coupled
    systems tight interactions based on poor decisions can magnify normal accidents
    into system-wide failure. In simple linear processes, such as an assembly line,
    failure has a visible impact on the next process but is identifiable and
    limited. When interactions are nonlinear and affect a variety of other systems,
    the failure of one component has unanticipated effects on many subsystems. If
    the subsystems are tightly coupled (highly interdependent) a failure quickly
    causes changes in multiple systems nearly simultaneously making it hard for
    leaders to diagnose the symptoms and see the extent of the developing failure.
    Because Airmen project power globally, anticipation of the impact even minor
    deviations from procedure or instruction can have is extremely challenging.
    This is the reason we stress adherence to standard operating procedures and
    Airmen must apply the habits of critical thinking before deviation from our
    normal operations   others are counting on our predictability to do their job
    safely as we work together to advance United States security interests.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34457"><span id="SPAN-34458">23.14.7.<b id="B-34459">&nbsp;Normalizing Deviance:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34460"><span id="SPAN-34461">23.14.7.1. This is the
    gradual acceptance of unexpected events and risk as a normal part of the
    operating environment. Eventually the deviations are accepted as a normal
    occurrence and no longer assessed using the habits of mind necessary to
    identify causes and find solutions. As organizational members become accustomed
    to the reoccurrence of seemingly minor but unpredicted anomalies in a system
    they become less concerned with the potential catastrophic effect of more
    severe failures of the same systems. The classic case is the&nbsp;<i id="I-34462">Challenger</i>&nbsp;space
    shuttle disaster. In this case, the erosion of O-rings was not within
    acceptable tolerances. However, after its occurrence several times with no
    catastrophic result, the members of the organization accepted their erosion as
    a normal and acceptable event, despite deviation from their engineering
    standards. In this case National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as an
    organization, was working hard to make space flight feel routine. The
    organization's culture, combined with cognitive bias and external pressures to
    make space flight routine led do the normalization of a potentially
    catastrophic failure.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34463"><span id="SPAN-34464">23.14.7.2. Normalization
    of deviance is the gradual acceptance of lower standards of performance. This
    practice produces shortcuts in the way organizations act. These variations then
    become normal procedures normalized to the point where the deviance is no
    longer even noticed. As Airmen we should not accept this practice, we guard
    against this by continuously questioning the way we do business and digging
    into any failure to meet the standards we set for performance.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34465"><span id="SPAN-34466">23.14.7.3.<b id="B-34467">&nbsp;</b>Airmen
    must be aware of the type of organization they operate within and understand
    its complex interactions. They must consciously identify the  close-calls' and
    deviances from normal operations. All Airmen must ensure deviations from
    standards are analyzed as part of the decision-making process to gain an
    understanding of how to improve programs and implement new decisions.</span></p>

    Drift.</b></span><sup id="SUP-34474"><span id="SPAN-34475">&nbsp;</span></sup><span id="SPAN-34476">Within large organizations, sub-unit leaders at
    all levels make decisions to maximize efficiency. They establish localized
    rules and procedures that comply with the overall intent of the organization.
    Over time these procedures become accepted practice. Similar to&nbsp;<i id="I-34477">Normalizing
    Deviance</i>&nbsp;(discussed above), this practice causes organizational norms
    to drift. Often, this drift is unproblematic however, under ambiguous
    conditions in complex interactive environments, divergence may lead to altered
    expectations and poor information flow (resulting in catastrophic cross-system
    failure; e.g. Blackhawk shoot down).</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34478"><span id="SPAN-34479">23.14.8.2. Airmen must
    be aware of how their decisions at the local level tie in with overall
    organizational goals, standards, and expectations. Leaders must use their
    awareness of organizational goals and standards to monitor&nbsp;<i id="I-34480">practical
    drift</i>&nbsp;in their areas of responsibility, recognizing disciplined
    initiative, while maintaining standards consistent with outside expectations.
    This task becomes difficult when many sub-units work together. Communications
    breakdowns across large organizations often cause a loss of perspective on
    how&nbsp;<i id="I-34481">practical drift</i>&nbsp;may be creating problems with follow-on
    unforeseen consequences.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34482"><span id="SPAN-34483">23.14.8.3. The challenge
    for Airmen of all ranks is that ambiguous threats do not trigger organizational
    responses. The failure to apply critical thinking to ambiguous threats means
    that the recovery window between the emergence of the threat and its occurrence
    as a catastrophic failure may narrow. National Aeronautics and Space
    Administration's organizational culture caused leaders to downplay O-ring
    failure, moving it from a critical to an ambiguous threat. Airmen at all levels
    must be aware that ambiguous threats may go unaddressed due to information
    filters caused by structural complexity and inter-organization power dynamics.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34484"><span id="SPAN-34485">23.14.8.4. Airmen in
    positions of responsibility must work to temper&nbsp;<i id="I-34486">practical drift</i>&nbsp;and
    create a culture where critical thinking is applied to ambiguous threats. This
    goal can be accomplished by developing processes for identifying and analyzing
    small problems and failures, treating them as potential indicators of larger
    problems.&nbsp; Effective techniques include: empowerment of front line
    troops/workers; and flattening hierarchies to reduce information filtering.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34505"><span id="SPAN-34506">23.15.1. Airmen at all
    levels participate in decision-making daily. The habits of mind necessary to
    assure we apply critical thought are something we must consciously foster. Our
    diverse and highly educated force brings to the table a wide variety of views,
    experiences, and abilities; providing the United States Air Force a deep pool
    of talent to draw ideas from. By using the techniques of good decision-making
    and fostering the development of habits of mind in our Airmen we tap into that
    rich pool of talent. When time allows we must consciously create processes to
    think though decisions using critical analysis of all factors, ensuring we
    focus on doing what is best for the nation and the Air Force. This effort to
    create habits of mind pays off when we must make decisions quickly and under
    great pressure. During these times we naturally fall back on the
    decision-making processes we use every day.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34507"><span id="SPAN-34508">23.15.2. In order to
    create these good habits of mind Airmen in leadership positions at all levels,
    from the back shop to the Air Staff, must create an environment where Airmen
    are free to exercise critical thought. We must guard against organizational
    cultures and leadership styles designed to simply arrive at a decision and
    quickly move on. Organizations and leaders focused on the decision, not the
    decision-making process tend to stifle critical analysis of issues and prevent
    development of good habits of mind; ultimately causing poor decision-making and
    negatively affecting the United States Air Force, the Department of Defense,
    and our nation.</span></p>

    <p id="P-34531"><span id="SPAN-34532">Airmen grapple with many issues that may make it
    difficult to concentrate on studying. To get promoted, you must study for your
    Promotion Fitness Exam or United States Air Force Supervisory Exam. The key to
    effective studying is to study smartly. You can begin with these effective

    <p id="P-34536"><span id="SPAN-34537">24.2.1.1. Many people
    consider studying a necessary task, rather than an enjoyable opportunity to
    learn, but research indicates that how you approach a task is almost as
    important as the task itself. Having the right mindset may help you study more
    effectively.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34538"><span id="SPAN-34539">24.2.1.2. Sometimes you
    can t force yourself to have the right mindset. During such times, you should
    take a study break. If you are distracted by other issues, studying will be an
    exercise in futility. Come back to it when you re not focused on something
    else.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34540"><span id="SPAN-34541">24.2.1.3. How to improve
    your study mindset:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34542"><span id="SPAN-34543">24.2.1.3.1. Decide to
    think positively while you study; remind yourself of your skills and abilities.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34544"><span id="SPAN-34545">24.2.1.3.2. Avoid
    catastrophic thinking. Instead of thinking,  I ll never have enough time to
    study for this exam,  think  It may be a little late to start studying, but if
    I do it now, I can still get most of it done. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34546"><span id="SPAN-34547">24.2.1.3.3. Avoid
    absolute thinking. Instead of thinking  I always mess up,  the more objective
    view is,  I didn t do very well last time. What can I do to improve? </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34548"><span id="SPAN-34549">24.2.1.3.4. Avoid

    Nothing You Don t:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34553"><span id="SPAN-34554">24.2.2.1. When you find
    an ideal place to study, you may bring things you don t need. For example, it
    may seem ideal to type notes into a computer to refer to later, but computers
    are a powerful distraction for many people. So ask yourself if you really need
    a computer to take notes, or can you make do with the old-fashioned paper and
    pencil.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34555"><span id="SPAN-34556">24.2.2.2. Don t forget

    Notes.</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34565"><span id="SPAN-34566">Many people find a
    standard outline format helps them boil information down to its most basic
    components, and connecting similar concepts makes information easier to
    remember during an exam. An outline is most effective as a learning tool when
    you use your own words and structure because everyone connects similar
    information differently. Failing to outline in your own style and words may
    result in failure to remember important items.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34567"><span id="SPAN-34568">24.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-34569">Use Memory Games (Mnemonic
    Devices):</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34570"><span id="SPAN-34571">20.2.4.1. Memory games,
    such as mnemonic devices, use simple word association to help remember pieces
    of information. Some people string together words to form an easy-to-remember
    nonsense sentence. The first letter of each word stands for a piece of the
    information you re trying to remember. A common military mnemonic device
    example is  Be My Little General of the Air Force.  The first letters of the
    words help you remember the general officer ranks: Brigadier, Major,
    Lieutenant, and General.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34572"><span id="SPAN-34573">24.2.4.2. The key to
    such memory devices is the new phrase or sentence you come up with has to be
    more memorable and easier to remember than the terms or information you re
    trying to learn. These don t work for everyone, so if mnemonics don t work for
    you, don t use them.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34574"><span id="SPAN-34575">24.2.5.&nbsp;<b id="B-34576">Practice,
    Practice, Practice.&nbsp;</b>The age-old adage  practice makes perfect  is

    <p id="P-34589"><span id="SPAN-34590">20.2.6.1. Many people
    plan to study when they get around to it or have some spare time. If you
    schedule study time the same way your duty hours are scheduled, you ll find
    studying is less hassle in the long run. Instead of last-minute cramming
    sessions, scheduling the same amount of study time every day for 3 to 6 months
    before your promotion test will be easier and enable you to learn more of the
    material.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34591"><span id="SPAN-34592">20.2.6.2. Some people
    study every day, others once or twice a week. Frequency isn t as important as
    actually studying routinely. Even if you study one day a week for 6 to 8
    months, that is better than a massive cram session a few days before the exam.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34593"><span id="SPAN-34594">24.2.7.&nbsp;<b id="B-34595">Build in Breaks and Rewards:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34596"><span id="SPAN-34597">20.2.7.1. If you view
    studying as a chore, it will be natural to avoid it. If, however, you use
    rewards to help reinforce what you re doing, you may be pleasantly surprised by
    an attitude change.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34598"><span id="SPAN-34599">20.2.7.2. Start by
    breaking study time into manageable components. Studying for 4 hours at a time
    without a break is unrealistic for most people. Studying for an hour followed
    by a 5-minute break and a snack may be more sustainable and enjoyable for you.
    Divide study time into segments that make sense and work for you.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34600"><span id="SPAN-34601">20.2.7.3. When
    establishing your goals, establish rewards as well. Tell yourself specifically
    what your reward will be if you reach your goal: Maybe  I will have a special
    dessert tonight if...,  or  I will buy a new song online if...,  or  I will
    spend an extra 30 minutes gaming if...  for reaching the established goal. The
    point is, find a reward that is small but real, and to stick to it. Setting
    limits on your behavior is a method to teach yourself discipline.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34602"><span id="SPAN-34603">24.2.8.&nbsp;<b id="B-34604">Stay Healthy and Balanced:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34605"><span id="SPAN-34606">20.2.8.1. It may seem
    hard to live a balanced life, but the more balanced your life, the easier every
    component becomes. If you spend all of your time focused on one thing, your
    life may become unbalanced. When that happens, everything becomes more
    difficult.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-34607"><span id="SPAN-34608">20.2.8.2. Maintaining a
    balanced life comes more easily over time, but you can work to improve health

    can affect your motivation to study. If you were totally isolated on a desert
    island, where there was absolutely nothing to do but study, you d study every

    be nothing to distract you. Having so many choices means now more than ever we

    Do You Want Out of Life?</b>&nbsp;To stay motivated, you should think about why
    you are studying. Presumably, studying is connected to what you want out of
    life, so ask yourself what you will ultimately get out of those things you do
    to avoid studying. Your life will be what you make of it.</span></p>

    <p id="P-35591"><b id="B-35592"><span id="SPAN-35593">25.1 Introduction:</span></b></p>
    
    <p id="P-35594"><span id="SPAN-35595">25.1.1. The Profession
    of Arms requires unique expertise to fulfill our collective responsibility to
    the American people.&nbsp;It is distinguished from others in society
    because of our expertise in the justified application of lethal military force
    and the willingness of those who serve to die for our Nation. Our profession is
    defined by our values, ethics, standards, skills and attributes.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35596"><span id="SPAN-35597">25.1.2. The U.S. Air
    Force and its Airmen wield our Nation's most powerful and responsive weapons.
    Every member of the U.S. Air Force team--Regular Air Force, Guard, Reserve and
    civilian--is entrusted with the responsibility of preserving U.S. national
    security. We provide vital skills to help ensure the Air Force is ready to
    answer our Nation's call. The trust placed by the Nation in our Airmen rests
    upon confidence in the character and competency of the men and women who serve.
    To continue this trust we must maintain and project power within the boundaries
    of a very sacred and honored Air Force ideal one based on our Air Force Core
    Values of&nbsp;<i id="I-35598">Integrity First, Service Before Self&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i id="I-35599">Excellence
    In All We Do</i>. Guided by these Core Values, the Air Force will continue to
    develop and inspire our Airmen within the Profession of Arms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35600"><span id="SPAN-35601">25.1.3. We are worthy of
    the Nation's trust through actions consistent with our Air Force Core Values
    summarized in one word: professionalism. As a service we maintain the trust of
    our Nation by integrating our Air Force Core Values into mission accomplishment
    daily, infusing professionalism into everything we do. Professionalism
    describes who we are as a service; how we conduct ourselves and live our lives;
    and it sets the standards to which all Airmen will be expected to adhere and
    exceed. Professionalism is about learning to lead oneself it is not just about
    what we do but also how we do it. Professionalism within the Air Force is
    framed by the requirement for trust, loyalty, dignity and personal commitment.
    Professionalism is the heart and soul of who we are and who we aspire to be
    every day. Our sense of professionalism underlies the pride we feel when we
    say&nbsp;<i id="I-35602">I am an American Airman</i>.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35603"><span id="SPAN-35604">25.1.4. This Roadmap is
    universal and reaches across every element and operation within the Air Force.
    Whether in war or peace, at home or abroad, on or off duty, our Airmen must
    hold true to the sacred trust our institution requires. A trust that respects
    all our fellow Airmen strives to bring out the best version of our people,
    commits to a higher calling of service and holds those who fail to maintain the
    honor our standards demand fully accountable. As Airmen we continually seek to
    deepen and foster our commitment to high personal standards of conduct.
    Ultimately, we instill and value who we are as Airmen within the Profession of
    Arms as our hallmark to shape and sustain Air Force culture today and well into
    the future.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35605"><span id="SPAN-35606">25.1.5. In direct
    support of the objectives outlined in this Roadmap, we established the
    Profession of Arms Center of Excellence (PACE) as an Air Force-level Center on
    March 2, 2015. PACE will champion our focused commitment to collaborating,
    coordinating and developing areas of growth and leadership for all of our
    Airmen. PACE, working closely with organizations across the Air Force, will
    help to provide deliberate, institution-wide strategies focused on supporting
    professionalism efforts with a common goal of enriching and enhancing the Air
    Force Profession of Arms. As a dedicated champion to the Air Force Profession
    of Arms, PACE will provide leadership, education and connectivity with current
    and emerging cylinders of excellence currently focused on enhancing human
    capital within the unique Profession of Arms. Through PACE, the Air Force
    senior leadership has a dedicated institution for direct focus and ability to
    modify specific Air Force requirements within the Profession of Arms. This
    Roadmap outlines an expectation, mindset and standard for which all future PACE
    operations will focus. An electronic copy of the Strategic Roadmap is available

    <p id="P-35845"><span id="SPAN-35846">First, we must
    understand that our chosen profession is that of a higher calling, in which we
    hold ourselves to higher standards. To serve proudly and capably, our
    commitment to our cause must be unbreakable; it must be bonded in our mutual
    respect for each other. Throughout our service we are guided and reminded of
    this awesome responsibility to our nation. The oaths we take remind us that we
    serve freely in support and defense of our Constitution. Our Air Force Core Values
    serve as our compass and provide the fortified foundation of our service. We
    abide by a Code of Conduct that captures our resolve, while our Airman's Creed
    highlights the strength of our diverse Airmen who fly, fight and win as one Air
    Force. We are the world's greatest Air Force...powered by Airmen, fueled by
    innovation; this book serves as a guide to the principles that make us so
    strong. Wherever you are in your Air Force career, it is a reminder to the
    meaning of service in our profession...The Profession of Arms.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35847"><span id="SPAN-35848">25.7.1.<b id="B-35849">&nbsp;A Profession of Arms:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35850"><span id="SPAN-35851">25.7.1.1. No profession
    asks more of its members than the Profession of Arms. As we state in our
    Airman's Creed, we have answered our nation's call. It is a higher calling, and
    it comes with a higher standard.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35852"><span id="SPAN-35853">25.7.1.2. General Ronald
    Fogleman, our 15th Chief of Staff once said,  We are not engaged in just
    another job; we are practitioners of the Profession of Arms. We are entrusted
    with the security of our nation, the protection of our citizens and the preservation
    of its way of life. In this capacity, we serve as guardians of America s
    future. By its very nature, this responsibility requires us to place the needs
    of our service and our country before personal concerns. </span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35854"><span id="SPAN-35855">25.7.1.3. That
    responsibility was given to each and every one of us when we raised our right
    hand and swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
    When we joined our Air Force with a sacred oath, we accepted a sacred trust
    from the American people, one that goes beyond anything else in society. As
    members of a joint team, our profession is distinguished from others because of
    our expertise in the justified application of lethal military force and the
    willingness of those who serve to pay the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. No
    other profession expects its members to lay down their lives for their friends,
    families or freedoms...but it's what our profession readily expects.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35856"><span id="SPAN-35857">25.7.1.4. And make no
    mistake, this is a profession. We are professionals. As volunteers, our sworn obligation
    is to the Constitution. Fighting America's wars is an ugly business - there is
    nothing pretty about it, cool about it or glorious about it - but it must be
    done, and somebody must be good at it. We re good at it. Our status as the
    world's greatest Air Force was earned by the men and women who have gone before
    us, and is carried on by every Airman who wears the uniform today.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35858"><span id="SPAN-35859">25.7.1.5. All service
    men and women belong to the Profession of Arms, from the most junior enlisted
    to our most senior leaders. We are all accountable for meeting ethical and
    performance standards in our actions and similarly accountable for our failure
    to take action, when appropriate. The distinction between ranks lies solely in
    our level of responsibility and the degree of accountability...not in our level
    of commitment to the Profession of Arms. We share the common attributes of
    character, courage and competence. We qualify as professionals through
    intensive training, education and practical experience. As professionals, we
    are defined by our strength of character, a life- long commitment to core
    values and a dedication to maintain our professional abilities through
    continuous improvement, individually and institutionally.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35860"><span id="SPAN-35861">25.7.1.6. We must
    remember above all else, we are patriots first. As service men and women we,
    more than anyone else, understand the price paid for freedom. We, more than
    anyone else, understand the sacrifices that come from willingly serving our
    country. We, more than anyone else, understand what it means to serve in the
    Profession of Arms.</span></p>

    <p id="P-35865"><span id="SPAN-35866">25.7.2.1. Respect is at
    the root of the Profession of Arms and bonds every Airman who voluntarily
    serves. Respect is the feeling of esteem or deference for a person or other
    entity, but in the Air Force it takes on a greater meaning and importance.
    Respect is the lifeblood of our profession. Without it, we simply cannot stand
    strong in the defense of our nation. Mutual respect strengthens our team and
    eliminates seams that reveal a weakness in the force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35867"><span id="SPAN-35868">25.7.2.2. Respect in the
    Profession of Arms goes beyond professional courtesy. It means accepting others
    for who they are, embracing a heightened personal sense of humility and
    fostering an environment of inclusiveness in which every Airman is able and eager
    to offer their skills, abilities and ideas. It means treating the equipment and
    resources in our possession with care, understanding and embracing the power of
    diversity and holding those who mistreat others accountable. More than
    anything, we must respect the humbling mission placed in our hands by the
    American people, and the impact our weapons and our actions can have around the
    globe.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35869"><span id="SPAN-35870">25.7.2.3. Our Air Force
    is a critical part of the greatest fighting force the world has ever known;
    it's powered by the greatest Airmen the world has ever seen. Through respect
    for each other, our resources and our mission, we will continue to provide
    Global Vigilance, Global Reach and Global Power for America.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35871"><span id="SPAN-35872">25.7.3.<b id="B-35873">&nbsp;Air Force Core Values.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35874"><span id="SPAN-35875">Values represent
    enduring, guiding principles for which we as individuals or organizations
    stand.  Core  values are so fundamental that they define our very identity. The
    United States Air Force has clearly defined its identity by these three simple
    values: Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In All We Do.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35876"><span id="SPAN-35877">For those of us who join
    this proud community of Airmen - whether officer, enlisted, civilian, Active,
    Guard, or Reserve - being a part of the Air Force family requires we commit to
    living these values, on and off duty. This is the expectation of our
    profession, and is the standard against which our fellow service members and
    the American public hold us. The Air Force Professional is a trusted servant of
    our Nation who adheres to the highest standards of character, courage and
    competence. How we act represents to countless others the collective identity
    of the United States Air Force.</span></p>

    <p id="P-35881"><span id="SPAN-35882">25.7.3.1.1.<b id="B-35883">&nbsp;</b>Understanding
    the Core Values is relatively easy. The true challenge is to live them. It's a

    <p id="P-35884"><span id="SPAN-35885">25.7.3.1.2.<b id="B-35886">&nbsp;</b>We
    all have the ability to display integrity, both professionally and personally.
    We have all placed ourselves in a position to serve a greater purpose. And we
    all have the innate desire to achieve excellence. Yet there will be moments
    where living and acting by the Core Values will be challenging.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35887"><span id="SPAN-35888">25.7.3.1.3.<b id="B-35889">&nbsp;</b>These
    moments are also opportunities to prove, through our actions, that we truly
    embody these Core Values. In doing so, we honor the heritage and continue the
    legacy of those who served before us and sacrificed so much. It is through this
    alignment of our actions with these values that we, as an Air Force, earn the
    public's trust, strengthen our Service, and accomplish our mission. These are
    the Core Values of our Air Force.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35890"><span id="SPAN-35891">25.7.3.1.4.<b id="B-35892">&nbsp;</b>Each
    of these Core Values is further defined by virtues (desired behaviors and
    characteristics) we must practice and demonstrate in our daily lives, showing
    we truly do value Integrity, Service and Excellence. Consistently practicing
    these virtues results in habits of honorable thought and action, producing an
    Air Force Professional. Air Force Professionalism is a shared belief in, and a
    commitment to, honorable service based on our Air Force Core Values.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35893"><span id="SPAN-35894">25.7.3.2.<b id="B-35895">&nbsp;Integrity First:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35896"><span id="SPAN-35897">25.7.3.2.1. Integrity is
    simply doing the right thing, all the time, whether everyone is watching or no
    one is watching. It is the compass that keeps us on the right path when we are
    confronted with ethical challenges and personal temptations, and it is the
    foundation upon which trust is built. An individual realizes integrity when
    thoughts and actions align with what he or she knows to be right. The virtues
    that demonstrate one truly values integrity include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35898"><span id="SPAN-35899">25.7.3.2.2.&nbsp;<b id="B-35900">Honesty
    is the hallmark of integrity.</b>&nbsp;As public servants, we are trusted
    agents. Honesty requires us to evaluate our performance against standards, and
    to conscientiously and accurately report findings. It drives us to advance our
    skills and credentials through our own effort. The service member's word must
    be unquestionable. This is the only way to preserve the trust we hold so dear
    with each other and with the population we serve.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35901"><span id="SPAN-35902">25.7.3.2.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-35903">Courage
    is not the absence of fear, but doing the right thing despite the fear.</b>&nbsp;Courage
    empowers us to take necessary personal or professional risks, make decisions
    that may be unpopular, and admit to our mistakes; having the courage to take
    these actions is crucial for the mission, the Air Force, and the Nation.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35904"><span id="SPAN-35905">25.7.3.2.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-35906">Accountability
    is responsibility with an audience.</b>&nbsp;That audience may be the American
    people, our units, our supervisors, our fellow Airmen, our families, our loved
    ones, and even ourselves. Accountable individuals maintain transparency, seek
    honest and constructive feedback, and take ownership of the outcomes of their
    actions and decisions. They are responsible to themselves and others and
    refrain from actions which discredit themselves or our service.</span></p>
    
    
    
    <p id="P-35907"><span id="SPAN-35908">25.7.3.3.&nbsp;<b id="B-35909">Service Before Self:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35910"><span id="SPAN-35911">25.7.3.3.1. Service
    before self tells us that professional duties take precedence over personal
    desires. The call to serve is a call to live according to a higher standard. It
    is not just a job; it is a commitment that takes energy, dedication, and sacrifice.
    We do not  work  in the Air Force; we serve in the Air Force. A heart and
    mindset for service allows us to embrace expectations and requirements not
    levied on the American public or other professions. The virtues that
    demonstrate one truly values service include:</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35912"><span id="SPAN-35913">25.7.3.3.2. Duty is the
    obligation to perform what is required for the mission. While our
    responsibilities are determined by the law, the Department of Defense, and Air
    Force instructions, directives, and guidance, our sense of duty is a personal
    one and bound by the oath of service we took as individuals. Duty sometimes
    calls for sacrifice in ways no other profession has or will. Airmen who truly
    embody Service Before Self consistently choose to make necessary sacrifices to
    accomplish the mission, and in doing so, we honor those who made the ultimate
    sacrifice.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35914"><span id="SPAN-35915">25.7.3.3.3. Loyalty is
    an internal commitment to the success and preservation of something bigger than
    ourselves. Our loyalty is to the Nation first, the values and commitments of
    our Air Force second, and finally to the men and women with whom we serve.
    Loyalty to our leaders requires us to trust, follow, and execute their
    decisions, even when we disagree. We offer alternative solutions and innovative
    ideas most effectively through the chain of command. Ultimately, loyalty is
    demonstrated by helping each other act with honor.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35916"><span id="SPAN-35917">25.7.3.3.4. Respect is
    treating others with dignity and valuing them as individuals. We must always
    act knowing that all Airmen possess fundamental worth as human beings. We must
    treat others with the utmost dignity and respect, understanding that our
    diversity is a great source of strength.</span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35918"><span id="SPAN-35919">25.7.3.4.&nbsp;<b id="B-35920">Excellence In All We Do:</b></span></p>
    
    <p id="P-35921"><span id="SPAN-35922">25.7.3.4.1. Excellence
    in all we do does not mean that we demand perfection in everything from
    everyone. Instead, this value directs us to continuously advance our craft and
    increase our knowledge as Airmen. We must have a passion for continuous
    improvement and innovation that propels America's Air Force in quantum leaps
    towards accomplishment and performance.</span></p>

    mindset of stewardship, initiative, improvement, pride, and a continued
    commitment to anticipate and embrace change. Our work areas, our processes, and
    our interpersonal interactions must be undeniably professional and positive.
    Our people are the platform for delivering innovative ideas, strategies, and

    demonstrate it in attitude, work ethic, and effort directed at continuous
    improvement, whether it be pursuing professional military education or
    nurturing ourselves physically, intellectually, emotionally, or spiritually.
    Each Airman represents the entire Air Force. Our appearance, actions, and words
    shape the culture of the Air Force and the reputation of the entire military

    challenge and motivate each other. We carry our own weight, and whenever
    necessary, help our wingmen carry theirs. We serve in the greatest Air Force in
